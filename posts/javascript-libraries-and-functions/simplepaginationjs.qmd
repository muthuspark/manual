## Introduction

### What is simplePagination.js?

`simplePagination.js` is a lightweight, easy-to-use JavaScript library designed to add simple pagination functionality to your web applications.  It allows you to efficiently display large datasets in a user-friendly manner by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pages.  This library focuses on simplicity and minimal dependencies, making it ideal for projects where a robust, feature-rich pagination solution might be overkill.


### Key Features

* **Lightweight:**  Minimal code size for fast loading times.
* **Easy to Use:**  Simple API with minimal configuration required.
* **Customizable:**  Easily style the pagination controls to match your application's design.
* **Client-Side Pagination:**  All pagination logic is handled on the client-side, reducing server load.
* **No Dependencies:** Works independently without requiring other JavaScript libraries.


### Getting Started

`simplePagination.js` is designed for quick integration.  After installation (see below), you'll primarily interact with a single function to generate your pagination controls. This function will take your data and the desired number of items per page as input.  Then, it generates the necessary HTML for the pagination links.  You will then need to handle the display and updating of your data based on the selected page.


### Installation

There are several ways to install `simplePagination.js`:

1. **Direct Download:** Download the `simplePagination.js` file from [link to download - replace this with actual link].  Include it in your HTML using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="simplePagination.js"></script>
```

2. **npm (Node Package Manager):**  If you're using npm, you can install it via:

```bash
npm install simple-pagination-js  //replace with actual package name if different
```

Then, you can include it in your project using a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel.  Consult the documentation for your bundler for specific instructions.

3. **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** A CDN link (if available) can be used for easy inclusion.  Replace `[CDN_LINK]` with the actual CDN link:


```html
<script src="[CDN_LINK]"></script>
```

Remember to replace placeholders like `[link to download]` and `[CDN_LINK]` with the actual URLs.


## Basic Usage

### Creating a Pagination Instance

To begin, create a new pagination instance using the `simplePagination` function. This function accepts a single argument: an options object.  While not strictly required, the `itemsPerPage` option is highly recommended for controlling how many items appear on each page.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({
  itemsPerPage: 10 //Number of items to display per page
});

//or if you want to override default settings, you can pass options:

const pagination = simplePagination({
  itemsPerPage: 10,
  maxVisibleButtons: 7, //number of page buttons to show at a time. Defaults to 7 if not set
  prevText: 'Previous', // customize previous button text, defaults to 'Previous'
  nextText: 'Next' //customize next button text, defaults to 'Next'
});
```

### Setting up Data

Next, provide your data to the `pagination` instance. This data should be an array of items you want to paginate.  The `setData` method handles this:

```javascript
const myData = [/* Your array of data items */];
pagination.setData(myData);
```

### Rendering the Pagination

Once your data is set, generate the pagination controls using the `getPaginationHTML` method. This method returns an HTML string containing the pagination links. You'll then need to insert this HTML into your webpage where you want the pagination to appear.

```javascript
const paginationHTML = pagination.getPaginationHTML();
document.getElementById('pagination-container').innerHTML = paginationHTML;
```

Remember to have a container element with the ID `pagination-container` (or adjust to your needs) in your HTML.

### Handling Page Changes

The pagination links generated by `getPaginationHTML` will trigger events when clicked. The `onPageChange` method should be used to listen for those events. You will need to define a callback function within `onPageChange` that receives the currently selected page number as a parameter.  This callback is responsible for updating the displayed data to reflect the currently selected page.  You'll generally use the `.getCurrentPage()` method of the `pagination` object to retrieve the selected page number.  Use this number to slice your dataset and display the appropriate subset.

```javascript
pagination.onPageChange((currentPage) => {
  const startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * pagination.itemsPerPage;
  const endIndex = startIndex + pagination.itemsPerPage;
  const currentItems = myData.slice(startIndex, endIndex);

  // Update your UI to display currentItems
  displayData(currentItems); //Your function to display the data.
});


function displayData(data){
    //logic to display your data in a list or table for example.
    let dataHTML = "<ul>";
    data.forEach(item=>{
        dataHTML += `<li>${item}</li>`;
    });
    dataHTML += "</ul>";
    document.getElementById("data-container").innerHTML = dataHTML;

}
```

Remember to create a `data-container` element in your HTML to hold the data.  Adapt `displayData` to your specific data display method (e.g., updating a table, list, or other UI element).


## Configuration Options

The `simplePagination` function accepts an options object to customize its behavior.  Many options have default values, so you only need to specify those you wish to change.  All options are optional.

### `itemsPerPage`

Specifies the number of items to display per page.  This is a crucial setting.  If not provided in the options object during initialization,  it defaults to 10.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ itemsPerPage: 20 });
```

### `maxPagesToShow`

Controls the maximum number of page number buttons visible at once in the pagination controls.  This helps prevent excessively long pagination bars.  Defaults to 7 if not specified.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ maxPagesToShow: 5 });
```

### `currentPage`

Specifies the initial page number to display. Defaults to 1.  Note that this only sets the *initial* page; page changes are handled through user interaction and the `onPageChange` callback (see below).

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ currentPage: 3 });
```

### `pageRange`

This option is deprecated. Use `maxPagesToShow` instead.


### `previousButton`

Allows customizing the text displayed on the "Previous" button. Defaults to "Previous".  Set to `false` to hide the "Previous" button.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ previousButton: 'Prev' });
const pagination = simplePagination({ previousButton: false }); //hide previous button
```

### `nextButton`

Allows customizing the text displayed on the "Next" button. Defaults to "Next". Set to `false` to hide the "Next" button.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ nextButton: 'Next >' });
const pagination = simplePagination({ nextButton: false }); //hide next button
```

### `firstButton`

Allows customizing the text displayed on the "First" button. Defaults to "<<". Set to `false` to hide the "First" button.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ firstButton: 'First' });
const pagination = simplePagination({ firstButton: false }); //hide first button
```

### `lastButton`

Allows customizing the text displayed on the "Last" button. Defaults to ">>". Set to `false` to hide the "Last" button.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ lastButton: 'Last' });
const pagination = simplePagination({ lastButton: false }); //hide last button
```

### `showPageNumbers`

A boolean value (true/false) to control whether page numbers are displayed in the pagination controls. Defaults to `true`.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ showPageNumbers: false });
```

### `showPreviousButton`

A boolean value (true/false) to control whether the "Previous" button is displayed. Defaults to `true`.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ showPreviousButton: false });
```

### `showNextButton`

A boolean value (true/false) to control whether the "Next" button is displayed. Defaults to `true`.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ showNextButton: false });
```

### `showFirstButton`

A boolean value (true/false) to control whether the "First" button is displayed. Defaults to `true`.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ showFirstButton: false });
```

### `showLastButton`

A boolean value (true/false) to control whether the "Last" button is displayed. Defaults to `true`.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({ showLastButton: false });
```

### `customClasses`

Allows adding custom CSS classes to the pagination container and individual buttons.  This is an object where keys are element names ('container', 'previous', 'next', 'first', 'last', 'page') and values are strings of space-separated class names.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({
  customClasses: {
    container: 'my-pagination',
    page: 'page-button'
  }
});
```

### `onPageChange` Callback

This is a function that's called whenever the currently selected page changes.  It receives the new page number as an argument.  This is essential for updating the displayed data to match the selected page.  See the "Handling Page Changes" section for a detailed example.

```javascript
const pagination = simplePagination({
  itemsPerPage: 10,
  onPageChange: (currentPage) => {
    // Your logic to update displayed data based on currentPage
  }
});
```


## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Pagination Appearance

Beyond the basic configuration options, you can extensively customize the appearance of the pagination using CSS. The `simplePagination` library applies default classes to its elements (e.g., `pagination-container`, `page-button`, `previous-button`, etc.), allowing you to target these classes with your CSS rules.  The `customClasses` option (see Configuration Options) further enhances this by letting you add your own classes.  This approach promotes separation of concerns, keeping the JavaScript logic clean and the styling manageable with CSS. For example:


```css
.my-pagination {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-top: 20px;
}

.page-button {
  padding: 8px 12px;
  margin: 0 5px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.page-button.active {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
}
```

Remember to replace `.my-pagination` and `.page-button` with your actual custom class names if used.


### Integrating with other libraries

`simplePagination.js` is designed to be unobtrusive and work well with other libraries.  Since it's client-side only and has no dependencies, you should be able to integrate it seamlessly into projects using frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or other JavaScript libraries.  The key is to ensure proper event handling and data management between `simplePagination.js` and your chosen framework or library.  For example, in React, you would typically handle the `onPageChange` callback within your component's state management system and re-render the data accordingly.


### Handling large datasets

For extremely large datasets (millions of items),  client-side pagination might become inefficient.  While `simplePagination.js` handles pagination on the client, consider these approaches to enhance performance:

* **Server-Side Pagination:** Fetch only the data needed for the current page from the server.  This significantly reduces the amount of data transferred and processed by the client.  This requires changes to your server-side code to handle pagination requests and responses.
* **Lazy Loading:** Load data in chunks or on demand as users scroll or navigate through pages.  This can be combined with server-side pagination to optimize data loading.
* **Data Filtering/Searching:** Implement data filtering or searching to reduce the dataset size before applying pagination.  This can greatly improve client-side performance.


### Accessibility Considerations

To ensure your pagination is accessible to users of assistive technologies, follow these guidelines:

* **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate semantic HTML elements.  For example, use `<nav>` for the pagination container, `<button>` for page links, and ARIA attributes (if needed) to enhance accessibility.
* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Ensure the pagination controls are fully navigable using the keyboard.
* **Screen Reader Compatibility:**  Test the pagination with screen readers to verify that the information is properly conveyed to visually impaired users.  Appropriate ARIA attributes can enhance screen reader support.
* **Clear Visual Indicators:** Use clear visual cues (like active page highlighting) to indicate the current page.
* **Alternative Text:** For visually impaired users relying on screen readers, ensure that sufficient alternative text is available for all interactive elements (buttons).




## API Reference

### Constructor

The `simplePagination` constructor creates a new pagination instance. It accepts a single argument: an options object (see Configuration Options for details).  The options object allows you to customize various aspects of the pagination's behavior and appearance.  The constructor returns a `simplePagination` object with associated methods.

```javascript
const paginationInstance = simplePagination({
  itemsPerPage: 10,
  maxPagesToShow: 7,
  onPageChange: myOnPageChangeHandler //your callback function
});
```


### Methods

* **`setData(data)`:** Sets the data array to be paginated.  `data` should be an array of items. This method must be called before calling `getPaginationHTML`.

* **`getPaginationHTML()`:** Generates the HTML string for the pagination controls.  This method returns an HTML string containing the pagination links. You must call `setData` before calling this method.

* **`getCurrentPage()`:** Returns the currently selected page number (integer).

* **`getTotalPages()`:** Returns the total number of pages based on the data and `itemsPerPage` setting.

* **`getItemsPerPage()`:** Returns the number of items displayed per page.

* **`onPageChange(callback)`:** Sets a callback function that is executed whenever the user changes the page. The callback function receives the new page number as its argument.  This is crucial for updating your data display.

* **`destroy()`:** Removes any event listeners associated with the pagination instance and cleans up any added HTML.  This is useful when you no longer need the pagination (e.g., when a component unmounts).


### Events

The primary event associated with `simplePagination.js` is the page change event, handled through the `onPageChange` method.  This method does not directly trigger an "event" in the traditional sense (like a DOM event), but rather provides a mechanism to respond to page changes via a callback function.  The callback function is triggered internally by the library when a user clicks a pagination link.  There are no other explicitly triggered events within the library itself.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Pagination not rendering:** Ensure that you have correctly included `simplePagination.js` in your HTML and that you've called both `setData()` and `getPaginationHTML()`.  Double-check that the HTML element where you're inserting the pagination (`innerHTML`) actually exists. Also verify that you are providing a valid array to `setData()`.  A common mistake is providing an object instead of an array. Inspect your browser's console for JavaScript errors.

* **Incorrect page numbers or behavior:**  Verify your `itemsPerPage` setting and ensure it's correctly reflecting the desired number of items per page.  Review your `onPageChange` callback function to confirm that it accurately calculates and displays the correct subset of data for each page.

* **Styling issues:** If the pagination doesn't look as expected, ensure your CSS is correctly targeting the relevant classes applied by `simplePagination.js`. Remember that you can customize these using the `customClasses` option. Inspect your page using the browser's developer tools to identify any CSS conflicts or incorrect styling.

* **No response to page clicks:** Make sure you have correctly set the `onPageChange` callback.  Inspect the browser's console for errors in your callback function.  Ensure the callback is properly referencing and manipulating your data and UI elements.

* **Error Messages:** Pay close attention to any error messages displayed in your browser's JavaScript console.  These messages can often pinpoint the exact cause of the problem.


### Debugging Tips

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML generated by `getPaginationHTML()`, check for JavaScript errors in the console, and debug your `onPageChange` callback function using breakpoints.

* **Console Logging:** Add `console.log()` statements to various points in your code (including within the `onPageChange` callback) to track the values of variables, the data being processed, and the state of the pagination at different stages.  This is particularly helpful in identifying issues with data manipulation or calculations.

* **Simplify:** If you encounter complex problems, try simplifying your code.  Create a minimal example with a small dataset to isolate the issue and reproduce the problem.  Once you've solved the simplified version, gradually add back complexity.

* **Check Data:**  Ensure the data you're passing to `setData()` is a valid array with the correct format. Use `console.log()` to check the contents of your data array to rule out data-related issues.

* **Version Compatibility:** If you are experiencing unexpected behavior, make sure that your version of `simplePagination.js` is compatible with your browser and other libraries you're using. Check the library's documentation or release notes for any relevant information about supported environments.
