Unlike traditional script tags or other larger module loaders, AlmondJS focuses on minimizing runtime overhead and producing smaller, faster-loading application bundles. It's particularly well-suited for projects where minimizing the initial download size and improving page load performance are critical. AlmondJS is built to work with AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) modules, a popular standard for structuring JavaScript code into reusable and independent units.  Once your modules are defined using the AMD format, AlmondJS takes care of efficiently loading and connecting them.\n\n\n### Why use AlmondJS?\n\nYou should consider using AlmondJS if:\n\n* **Performance is paramount:** AlmondJS prioritizes speed.  Its small size and efficient loading mechanisms lead to faster initial page loads and a more responsive user experience.\n* **You're working with AMD modules:**  If your project already utilizes the AMD module structure (or you're building new code with this approach), AlmondJS provides a streamlined and optimized way to manage these modules.\n* **You need a lightweight solution:** AlmondJS has a tiny footprint compared to more comprehensive module loaders. This makes it ideal for applications where minimizing the total JavaScript code size is important, such as mobile web apps or applications with limited bandwidth.\n* **You prefer a simple API:** AlmondJS offers a clean and straightforward API, making it easy to learn and integrate into existing projects.\n\n\n### Key features and benefits\n\n* **Small size:**  AlmondJS is incredibly compact, resulting in smaller download sizes and faster load times.\n* **AMD compatibility:**  Seamlessly integrates with AMD-defined modules.\n* **Optimized for speed:**  Designed for efficiency, minimizing runtime overhead and improving performance.\n* **Simple API:**  Easy to learn and use, requiring minimal configuration.\n* **Dependency resolution:**  Automatically handles the loading of dependent modules.\n* **Built-in error handling:**  Provides mechanisms for gracefully handling module loading errors.\n\n\n### Target audience\n\nAlmondJS is ideal for:\n\n* **Front-end JavaScript developers:**  Those building web applications who need a performant and lightweight module loader.\n* **Developers working on mobile web applications:**  Where small download sizes and fast loading times are crucial for a positive user experience.\n* **Developers focusing on performance optimization:**  Those seeking to improve the speed and efficiency of their JavaScript applications.\n* **Developers already using AMD modules:**  Those wanting a simple, effective loader for their existing AMD-structured code.\n\n\n### Setting up your environment\n\n1. **Download AlmondJS:** Download the latest version of AlmondJS from [Insert Link to Download Here, e.g., a GitHub release or CDN].  You'll typically get a single `.js` file.\n\n2. **Include in your HTML:** Include the AlmondJS script in your HTML file before any other modules that depend on it.  This is crucial for Almond to properly manage the loading sequence.  An example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>AlmondJS Example</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <script src=\"almond.js\"></script>  <!-- AlmondJS file -->\n  <script src=\"my-app.js\"></script> <!-- Your main application module -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n3. **Structure your AMD modules:**  Ensure your JavaScript code is structured as AMD modules.  This usually involves using `define()` to define modules and their dependencies.  An example of an AMD module:\n\n```javascript\n// my-module.js\ndefine(['dependency-module'], function(dependency) {\n  // Your module code here, using the dependency\n  return {\n    someMethod: function() {\n      console.log(\"My module works!  Dependency:\", dependency);\n    }\n  };\n});\n```\n\n4. **Configure Almond (Optional):**  While not strictly required for basic use, Almond can be configured for advanced scenarios such as loading modules from a specific path.  Refer to the [Insert Link to Advanced Configuration Documentation Here] for more information.\n\nNow you're ready to start using AlmondJS to manage your AMD modules and build faster, more efficient JavaScript applications.  Remember to consult the API documentation for more details on Almond's features and capabilities.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Modules and Dependencies\n\nAlmondJS is fundamentally built around the concept of modular JavaScript.  A *module* is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates functionality and data. Modules promote code reusability, maintainability, and organization.  A key aspect of modules is *dependencies*: one module might rely on the functionality provided by other modules.  AlmondJS manages these dependencies, ensuring that all required modules are loaded before a module that depends on them can execute.\n\nIn AlmondJS, dependencies are declared explicitly. When defining a module, you list the modules it depends on.  AlmondJS then loads these dependencies before executing the module's code.  This ensures that everything a module needs is available when it runs, preventing errors and improving code clarity.\n\n### Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)\n\nAlmondJS is specifically designed to work with the Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) specification.  AMD is a standard for defining modules in JavaScript that emphasizes asynchronous loading. This means that modules are loaded in the background without blocking the execution of other parts of your application, contributing to improved performance and responsiveness.\n\nThe core of AMD is the `define` function.  This function allows you to declare a module and its dependencies.  The `define` function takes three arguments:\n\n1. **`dependencies` (array):** An array of strings representing the module's dependencies (or an empty array if it has none).\n2. **`factory` (function):** A function that creates and returns the module's value. This function receives the dependencies as arguments.\n3. **`moduleValue` (optional):**  If you're not using a factory function, this can be a value directly returned by the module.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['dependencyModule'], function(dependency) {\n  // Module code using 'dependency'\n  return {\n      someFunction: function() { /* ... */ }\n  };\n});\n```\n\nThis example shows a module with a dependency on `dependencyModule`.  The `factory` function receives the `dependencyModule` as an argument and uses it within the module's code. The module then returns an object containing its functionality.\n\n\n### Almond's Build Process\n\nWhile AlmondJS is primarily a runtime loader, it's often used in conjunction with a build process.  A build process optimizes your modules for production environments.  This typically involves:\n\n* **Module concatenation:** Combining multiple modules into a single file to reduce HTTP requests.\n* **Optimization:** Minifying the combined code to reduce its size.\n* **Dependency resolution:**  Analyzing dependencies to ensure the correct loading order at runtime.\n\nTools like RequireJS Optimizer (r.js) or similar build systems are commonly employed with AlmondJS to perform these build steps. The output from these build processes will be a single optimized JavaScript file containing all modules and dependencies, ready for deployment.  This results in significantly improved load times and reduced HTTP overhead.  The build process essentially pre-computes the module dependencies, making the runtime loading phase in the browser very quick.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nAlmondJS offers minimal configuration options.  Unlike some other loaders, it doesn't require extensive configuration files. However, it does support some basic configuration through the `require` function in specific situations:\n\n* **`require.config()` (Advanced):**  This function provides a way to adjust Almond's behavior.  You might use this to define base paths for locating modules or to specify custom module loading plugins.  However, this is generally needed only for non-trivial deployments or if you need to modify the standard AMD module resolution process. Consult the advanced documentation for details on these configuration options.  Often, simple projects don't require any configuration beyond including the Almond script in the HTML.\n\n### The Almond API\n\nAlmondJS presents a very lean API.  Its core functionality is primarily handled behind the scenes.  The main interaction you'll have is through the `require` function:\n\n* **`require([dependencies], callback)`:** This function loads the specified dependencies and then executes the `callback` function, passing the loaded modules as arguments. This is how you load and use modules in your main application entry point.  It's asynchronous and won't block the execution of your application while waiting for modules to load.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nrequire(['myModule', 'anotherModule'], function(myModule, anotherModule) {\n  // Use myModule and anotherModule here\n  myModule.someFunction();\n  anotherModule.doSomething();\n});\n```\n\nThis `require` call loads `myModule` and `anotherModule`, and then the callback function uses them.  The core strength of Almond's API is its simplicity and efficiency. Its focus is on loading modules rapidly without introducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n\n## Using AlmondJS\n\n### Creating a Simple AlmondJS Project\n\nThe simplest AlmondJS project consists of an HTML file and several JavaScript files structured as AMD modules.  Let's create a project with two modules: `greeting.js` and `main.js`.\n\n1. **Create `greeting.js`:** This module will simply provide a function to generate a greeting.\n\n```javascript\n// greeting.js\ndefine(function() {\n  return {\n    greet: function(name) {\n      return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n    }\n  };\n});\n```\n\n2. **Create `main.js`:** This module will be the entry point of your application. It will require `greeting.js` and use its functionality.\n\n```javascript\n// main.js\ndefine(['greeting'], function(greeting) {\n  var message = greeting.greet(\"World\");\n  console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, World!\n});\n```\n\n3. **Create `index.html`:** This HTML file will include AlmondJS and your modules.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Simple AlmondJS Project</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <script src=\"almond.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"main.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nRemember to place `almond.js`, `greeting.js`, and `main.js` in the same directory.  Opening `index.html` in your browser will execute the code, and you'll see \"Hello, World!\" logged to the console.\n\n\n### Defining Modules\n\nAMD modules are defined using the `define` function. The structure is as described in the \"Core Concepts\" section:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['dependency1', 'dependency2'], function(dependency1, dependency2) {\n  // Module code using dependency1 and dependency2\n  return { /* Module's public interface */ }; // Or return a value directly\n});\n```\n\nThe `define` function takes an array of dependency module IDs and a factory function (or a value to be returned directly).  The factory function's arguments are the loaded modules, in the order specified in the dependency array. The function must return the module's public API (as an object) or a single value. If there are no dependencies, the dependency array can be omitted or left empty `define(function(){...});`.\n\n\n\n### Requiring Modules\n\nModules are loaded and their values accessed using the `require` function:\n\n```javascript\nrequire(['moduleA', 'moduleB'], function(moduleA, moduleB) {\n  // Use moduleA and moduleB here\n  var result = moduleA.someMethod(moduleB.someValue);\n});\n```\n\nThis asynchronously loads `moduleA` and `moduleB`. Once both are loaded, the callback function executes, receiving them as arguments.\n\n\n### Exporting Modules\n\nA module exports its functionality via the return value of its factory function.  This can be a single value, an object containing methods and properties, or any other JavaScript data structure.  The consuming module then accesses these exported members.  The example in \"Defining Modules\" showcases the common pattern of returning an object.\n\n\n### Managing Dependencies\n\nAlmondJS automatically manages dependencies. By correctly declaring dependencies within the `define` function, Almond ensures that modules are loaded in the correct order. Circular dependencies are not supported.  If a module A depends on B, and B depends on A, this will result in an error.  Proper module design helps avoid this.\n\n\n### Working with Configuration Files\n\nWhile AlmondJS's simplicity often eliminates the need for configuration files, for larger projects with modules located in various subdirectories or requiring specialized loading mechanisms, `require.config()` can be utilized.  See the documentation regarding its advanced usage.\n\n\n### Building your Project\n\nFor production, use a build tool like r.js (RequireJS Optimizer) or similar to combine your modules into a single, optimized file.  This significantly reduces the number of HTTP requests, improving loading speed.  These tools will handle dependency resolution during the build process.\n\nThe process typically involves configuring your build tool to list your application's main module and instructing it to optimize the code.  This results in a production-ready, smaller, faster-loading version of your JavaScript application.\n\n\n\n### Debugging AlmondJS Projects\n\nDebugging AlmondJS projects is similar to debugging other JavaScript applications.  You can use your browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools) to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through the code.  Console logging (`console.log()`) is useful for monitoring module loading and values.  If you have issues with modules not loading, carefully review your `define` statements to ensure correct dependency declarations and the spelling of module IDs.  Network tools in your browser's developer tools can help identify loading errors related to network issues or incorrect module paths.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Optimizing Build Performance\n\nWhile AlmondJS is inherently fast, optimizing your build process can significantly improve performance.  Here are key strategies:\n\n* **Minification:** Use a minifier (like UglifyJS or Terser) to reduce the size of your bundled JavaScript code.  This directly impacts download times.\n* **Compression:** Enable GZIP or Brotli compression on your web server.  This reduces the size of the transferred file, further speeding up loading.\n* **Efficient Module Structure:**  Avoid overly large modules.  Break down large tasks into smaller, more focused modules to improve maintainability and allow for better code splitting (discussed below).\n* **Build Tool Optimization:**  If you are using a build tool like r.js, carefully configure it.  Ensure you're using optimization settings (e.g., code optimization levels) appropriate for your project needs.  Experiment to find the optimal balance between code size and build time.  Some build tools allow for fine-grained control over the build process (e.g., specifying which modules should be included or excluded).  Utilize these features to tailor the build to your application.\n* **Caching:** Leverage browser caching effectively.  Properly configure your HTTP headers to allow browsers to cache your optimized JavaScript files, reducing the need to re-download them on subsequent visits.\n\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nCode splitting divides your application into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary parts on demand.  This improves initial load times by deferring the loading of non-critical code.  With AlmondJS, you might achieve code splitting by organizing your application into distinct features or modules that are loaded only when the user interacts with them.  This might involve dynamically loading modules using `require` calls triggered by user actions or route changes.\n\n\n### Lazy Loading\n\nLazy loading is a specific form of code splitting where modules are loaded only when needed.  Instead of loading all modules upfront, you load them dynamically as required by the user's interaction.  This dramatically reduces the initial load time.  AlmondJS supports this by using the `require` function to load modules on demand, as needed.\n\nFor instance, imagine an e-commerce site with product details. You might initially only load the product list.  Only when a user clicks a product, do you then use `require` to load the detailed product information module.  This is highly effective for sites with significant amounts of content.\n\n### Plugin Development\n\nWhile AlmondJS itself is lightweight, you can extend its functionality with plugins.  These plugins allow for custom module loaders, handling of specific file types (e.g., loading JSON data), or other specialized tasks. Plugin development typically involves creating a module that conforms to a certain interface (this interface might not be explicitly defined but rather implied through how Almond interacts with plugins).  A plugin could intercept module requests, process them in a custom way, and then provide the result to Almond.\n\n\n### Integrating with Other Libraries\n\nAlmondJS works well with other JavaScript libraries.  Since it's an AMD-compatible loader, it can seamlessly load libraries that are structured as AMD modules.  Libraries that are not AMD-compliant may require wrapping them in an AMD module definition before loading them with Almond.   You define a wrapper module that uses `require` to load the external library, then expose the necessary parts through the module's API.\n\nFor example, if you want to use a library \"externalLib.js\" that is not AMD-compliant, you would create a wrapper module:\n\n```javascript\n// externalLibWrapper.js\ndefine(function() {\n  var externalLib = require('./externalLib.js');\n  return externalLib;\n});\n```\n\n\n### Testing AlmondJS Projects\n\nTesting is crucial for any project.  For AlmondJS projects, you can leverage popular JavaScript testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine.  You can test individual modules in isolation and then test the interaction between modules.  A good testing strategy should cover various scenarios, including error handling (e.g., what happens if a dependency fails to load).  Testing tools allow you to run tests automatically and ensure your code remains robust and error-free as you make changes. Consider mocking modules during testing to isolate units and control test inputs/outputs effectively.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors and Solutions\n\nHere are some common errors encountered when using AlmondJS and their solutions:\n\n* **`Uncaught Error: Module name \"moduleName\" has not been loaded yet for context: ...`**: This typically indicates a dependency issue. Double-check that `moduleName` is correctly declared as a dependency in the module that's trying to use it.  Ensure that the path to `moduleName` is correct relative to your main module or configured base paths. Also verify that `moduleName` itself is correctly defined as an AMD module.\n\n* **`Uncaught TypeError: ... is not a function`**:  This often means that a module wasn't loaded successfully or that a function you're calling doesn't exist.  Examine the console for other errors that might have preceded this. Check that the module is loaded correctly, using the browser's developer tools to inspect the object that is supposed to contain the function.  Verify that the function name is correctly spelled in your `require` callback.\n\n* **`Uncaught ReferenceError: ... is not defined`**:  Similar to the above, this usually means a variable is not accessible because the module where it is defined has not loaded or is not loaded correctly.  Make sure dependencies are correctly declared and modules are being loaded asynchronously as intended.\n\n* **`404 Not Found` error in the browser's developer console**:  This indicates that the browser couldn't find a specified module file.  Check your file paths within your HTML and AMD module definitions for typos or incorrect relative paths.  If using a build process, make sure the build process has copied all necessary files to the correct location.\n\n* **Modules not loading in the expected order**: While Almond handles dependency resolution, complex dependency graphs can sometimes lead to unexpected ordering issues. Verify your dependency structure carefully to eliminate circular dependencies and ensure a clear, linear flow.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The console is your friend!  Examine the console for error messages, warnings, and other valuable information. The network tab can show loading times and the success/failure of module requests. The sources tab lets you step through your JavaScript code using the debugger.\n\n* **`console.log()` statements:**  Strategically place `console.log()` statements in your modules to trace the flow of execution and inspect variable values.  This helps identify where problems might be arising.  Log module loading messages to verify they are loading in the expected order.\n\n* **Simplify your project:**  If you have a complex project and are struggling to identify a problem, try isolating parts of it.  Create a minimal, reproducible example that demonstrates the problem.  This often helps to pinpoint the source of the error quickly.\n\n* **Check your module paths:**  Ensure all file paths in your HTML and your `define` and `require` calls are correct and relative to the correct base directory.\n\n* **Verify AMD module structure:** Ensure your modules follow the correct AMD pattern using `define` and return values or objects as needed.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Build Issues\n\n* **Check your build tool configuration:**  Carefully review your build tool's configuration file to ensure it's correctly pointing to your AlmondJS file, your modules, and any other necessary dependencies.\n* **Clean your build directory:**  Sometimes leftover files from previous builds can cause problems.  Clean your build directory before running the build process again.\n* **Update your build tools:** Ensure your build tools (e.g., r.js, webpack if used) are up to date. Outdated tools can have bugs or compatibility issues.\n* **Consult the build tool's documentation:**  Build tools often have detailed documentation that provides troubleshooting guidance for common errors.\n* **Examine the build log:**  The build tool usually provides a log file that details the build process.  Examine this log for errors or warnings that can indicate the problem's source.\n\n\n### Community Support Resources\n\nWhile AlmondJS has a smaller community than some larger JavaScript projects, there are still resources available for support:\n\n* **Search for solutions online:** Search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) are often your first and best resource for finding solutions to common problems. Search for specific error messages or keywords related to your issues.\n* **Check GitHub issues:**  If AlmondJS is hosted on GitHub (or a similar platform), look at the issue tracker. Others may have encountered the same problem, and a solution may already exist.  Note: AlmondJS has limited community activity, so solutions may be less readily available compared to more actively maintained projects.\n* **Engage in online forums or communities:** Look for JavaScript or AMD-related forums or communities where you can ask questions. However, remember that community response time and depth of support might be slower for AlmondJS compared to more popularly used projects.\n\n\nRemember to provide a detailed description of your problem when seeking help, including relevant code snippets, error messages, and the steps you've already taken to troubleshoot the issue.  This will help others understand your situation and provide the most relevant assistance.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Glossary of Terms\n\n* **AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition):** A standard for defining modules in JavaScript that emphasizes asynchronous loading, improving performance and responsiveness.\n* **Module:** A self-contained unit of code that encapsulates functionality and data, promoting reusability and maintainability.\n* **Dependency:** A relationship where one module relies on the functionality provided by another module.\n* **Factory Function:**  A function within an AMD module definition that creates and returns the module's value or API.

Refer to the [Insert Link to Advanced Configuration Documentation Here] for more information.\n\nNow you're ready to start using AlmondJS to manage your AMD modules and build faster, more efficient JavaScript applications.  Remember to consult the API documentation for more details on Almond's features and capabilities.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Modules and Dependencies\n\nAlmondJS is fundamentally built around the concept of modular JavaScript.  A *module* is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates functionality and data. Modules promote code reusability, maintainability, and organization.  A key aspect of modules is *dependencies*: one module might rely on the functionality provided by other modules.  AlmondJS manages these dependencies, ensuring that all required modules are loaded before a module that depends on them can execute.\n\nIn AlmondJS, dependencies are declared explicitly. When defining a module, you list the modules it depends on.  AlmondJS then loads these dependencies before executing the module's code.  This ensures that everything a module needs is available when it runs, preventing errors and improving code clarity.\n\n### Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)\n\nAlmondJS is specifically designed to work with the Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) specification.  AMD is a standard for defining modules in JavaScript that emphasizes asynchronous loading. This means that modules are loaded in the background without blocking the execution of other parts of your application, contributing to improved performance and responsiveness.\n\nThe core of AMD is the `define` function.  This function allows you to declare a module and its dependencies.  The `define` function takes three arguments:\n\n1. **`dependencies` (array):** An array of strings representing the module's dependencies (or an empty array if it has none).\n2. **`factory` (function):** A function that creates and returns the module's value. This function receives the dependencies as arguments.\n3. **`moduleValue` (optional):**  If you're not using a factory function, this can be a value directly returned by the module.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['dependencyModule'], function(dependency) {\n  // Module code using 'dependency'\n  return {\n      someFunction: function() { /* ... */ }\n  };\n});\n```\n\nThis example shows a module with a dependency on `dependencyModule`.  The `factory` function receives the `dependencyModule` as an argument and uses it within the module's code. The module then returns an object containing its functionality.\n\n\n### Almond's Build Process\n\nWhile AlmondJS is primarily a runtime loader, it's often used in conjunction with a build process.  A build process optimizes your modules for production environments.  This typically involves:\n\n* **Module concatenation:** Combining multiple modules into a single file to reduce HTTP requests.\n* **Optimization:** Minifying the combined code to reduce its size.\n* **Dependency resolution:**  Analyzing dependencies to ensure the correct loading order at runtime.\n\nTools like RequireJS Optimizer (r.js) or similar build systems are commonly employed with AlmondJS to perform these build steps. The output from these build processes will be a single optimized JavaScript file containing all modules and dependencies, ready for deployment.  This results in significantly improved load times and reduced HTTP overhead.  The build process essentially pre-computes the module dependencies, making the runtime loading phase in the browser very quick.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nAlmondJS offers minimal configuration options.  Unlike some other loaders, it doesn't require extensive configuration files. However, it does support some basic configuration through the `require` function in specific situations:\n\n* **`require.config()` (Advanced):**  This function provides a way to adjust Almond's behavior.  You might use this to define base paths for locating modules or to specify custom module loading plugins.  However, this is generally needed only for non-trivial deployments or if you need to modify the standard AMD module resolution process. Consult the advanced documentation for details on these configuration options.  Often, simple projects don't require any configuration beyond including the Almond script in the HTML.\n\n### The Almond API\n\nAlmondJS presents a very lean API.  Its core functionality is primarily handled behind the scenes.  The main interaction you'll have is through the `require` function:\n\n* **`require([dependencies], callback)`:** This function loads the specified dependencies and then executes the `callback` function, passing the loaded modules as arguments. This is how you load and use modules in your main application entry point.  It's asynchronous and won't block the execution of your application while waiting for modules to load.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nrequire(['myModule', 'anotherModule'], function(myModule, anotherModule) {\n  // Use myModule and anotherModule here\n  myModule.someFunction();\n  anotherModule.doSomething();\n});\n```\n\nThis `require` call loads `myModule` and `anotherModule`, and then the callback function uses them.  The core strength of Almond's API is its simplicity and efficiency. Its focus is on loading modules rapidly without introducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n\n## Using AlmondJS\n\n### Creating a Simple AlmondJS Project\n\nThe simplest AlmondJS project consists of an HTML file and several JavaScript files structured as AMD modules.  Let's create a project with two modules: `greeting.js` and `main.js`.\n\n1. **Create `greeting.js`:** This module will simply provide a function to generate a greeting.\n\n```javascript\n// greeting.js\ndefine(function() {\n  return {\n    greet: function(name) {\n      return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n    }\n  };\n});\n```\n\n2. **Create `main.js`:** This module will be the entry point of your application. It will require `greeting.js` and use its functionality.\n\n```javascript\n// main.js\ndefine(['greeting'], function(greeting) {\n  var message = greeting.greet(\"World\");\n  console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, World!\n});\n```\n\n3. **Create `index.html`:** This HTML file will include AlmondJS and your modules.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Simple AlmondJS Project</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <script src=\"almond.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"main.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nRemember to place `almond.js`, `greeting.js`, and `main.js` in the same directory.  Opening `index.html` in your browser will execute the code, and you'll see \"Hello, World!\" logged to the console.\n\n\n### Defining Modules\n\nAMD modules are defined using the `define` function. The structure is as described in the \"Core Concepts\" section:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['dependency1', 'dependency2'], function(dependency1, dependency2) {\n  // Module code using dependency1 and dependency2\n  return { /* Module's public interface */ }; // Or return a value directly\n});\n```\n\nThe `define` function takes an array of dependency module IDs and a factory function (or a value to be returned directly).  The factory function's arguments are the loaded modules, in the order specified in the dependency array. The function must return the module's public API (as an object) or a single value. If there are no dependencies, the dependency array can be omitted or left empty `define(function(){...});`.\n\n\n\n### Requiring Modules\n\nModules are loaded and their values accessed using the `require` function:\n\n```javascript\nrequire(['moduleA', 'moduleB'], function(moduleA, moduleB) {\n  // Use moduleA and moduleB here\n  var result = moduleA.someMethod(moduleB.someValue);\n});\n```\n\nThis asynchronously loads `moduleA` and `moduleB`. Once both are loaded, the callback function executes, receiving them as arguments.\n\n\n### Exporting Modules\n\nA module exports its functionality via the return value of its factory function.  This can be a single value, an object containing methods and properties, or any other JavaScript data structure.  The consuming module then accesses these exported members.  The example in \"Defining Modules\" showcases the common pattern of returning an object.\n\n\n### Managing Dependencies\n\nAlmondJS automatically manages dependencies. By correctly declaring dependencies within the `define` function, Almond ensures that modules are loaded in the correct order. Circular dependencies are not supported.  If a module A depends on B, and B depends on A, this will result in an error.  Proper module design helps avoid this.\n\n\n### Working with Configuration Files\n\nWhile AlmondJS's simplicity often eliminates the need for configuration files, for larger projects with modules located in various subdirectories or requiring specialized loading mechanisms, `require.config()` can be utilized.  See the documentation regarding its advanced usage.\n\n\n### Building your Project\n\nFor production, use a build tool like r.js (RequireJS Optimizer) or similar to combine your modules into a single, optimized file.  This significantly reduces the number of HTTP requests, improving loading speed.  These tools will handle dependency resolution during the build process.\n\nThe process typically involves configuring your build tool to list your application's main module and instructing it to optimize the code.  This results in a production-ready, smaller, faster-loading version of your JavaScript application.\n\n\n\n### Debugging AlmondJS Projects\n\nDebugging AlmondJS projects is similar to debugging other JavaScript applications.  You can use your browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools) to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through the code.  Console logging (`console.log()`) is useful for monitoring module loading and values.  If you have issues with modules not loading, carefully review your `define` statements to ensure correct dependency declarations and the spelling of module IDs.  Network tools in your browser's developer tools can help identify loading errors related to network issues or incorrect module paths.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Optimizing Build Performance\n\nWhile AlmondJS is inherently fast, optimizing your build process can significantly improve performance.  Here are key strategies:\n\n* **Minification:** Use a minifier (like UglifyJS or Terser) to reduce the size of your bundled JavaScript code.  This directly impacts download times.\n* **Compression:** Enable GZIP or Brotli compression on your web server.  This reduces the size of the transferred file, further speeding up loading.\n* **Efficient Module Structure:**  Avoid overly large modules.  Break down large tasks into smaller, more focused modules to improve maintainability and allow for better code splitting (discussed below).\n* **Build Tool Optimization:**  If you are using a build tool like r.js, carefully configure it.  Ensure you're using optimization settings (e.g., code optimization levels) appropriate for your project needs.  Experiment to find the optimal balance between code size and build time.  Some build tools allow for fine-grained control over the build process (e.g., specifying which modules should be included or excluded).  Utilize these features to tailor the build to your application.\n* **Caching:** Leverage browser caching effectively.  Properly configure your HTTP headers to allow browsers to cache your optimized JavaScript files, reducing the need to re-download them on subsequent visits.\n\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nCode splitting divides your application into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary parts on demand.  This improves initial load times by deferring the loading of non-critical code.  With AlmondJS, you might achieve code splitting by organizing your application into distinct features or modules that are loaded only when the user interacts with them.  This might involve dynamically loading modules using `require` calls triggered by user actions or route changes.\n\n\n### Lazy Loading\n\nLazy loading is a specific form of code splitting where modules are loaded only when needed.  Instead of loading all modules upfront, you load them dynamically as required by the user's interaction.  This dramatically reduces the initial load time.  AlmondJS supports this by using the `require` function to load modules on demand, as needed.\n\nFor instance, imagine an e-commerce site with product details. You might initially only load the product list.  Only when a user clicks a product, do you then use `require` to load the detailed product information module.  This is highly effective for sites with significant amounts of content.\n\n### Plugin Development\n\nWhile AlmondJS itself is lightweight, you can extend its functionality with plugins.  These plugins allow for custom module loaders, handling of specific file types (e.g., loading JSON data), or other specialized tasks. Plugin development typically involves creating a module that conforms to a certain interface (this interface might not be explicitly defined but rather implied through how Almond interacts with plugins).  A plugin could intercept module requests, process them in a custom way, and then provide the result to Almond.\n\n\n### Integrating with Other Libraries\n\nAlmondJS works well with other JavaScript libraries.  Since it's an AMD-compatible loader, it can seamlessly load libraries that are structured as AMD modules.  Libraries that are not AMD-compliant may require wrapping them in an AMD module definition before loading them with Almond.   You define a wrapper module that uses `require` to load the external library, then expose the necessary parts through the module's API.\n\nFor example, if you want to use a library \"externalLib.js\" that is not AMD-compliant, you would create a wrapper module:\n\n```javascript\n// externalLibWrapper.js\ndefine(function() {\n  var externalLib = require('./externalLib.js');\n  return externalLib;\n});\n```\n\n\n### Testing AlmondJS Projects\n\nTesting is crucial for any project.  For AlmondJS projects, you can leverage popular JavaScript testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine.  You can test individual modules in isolation and then test the interaction between modules.  A good testing strategy should cover various scenarios, including error handling (e.g., what happens if a dependency fails to load).  Testing tools allow you to run tests automatically and ensure your code remains robust and error-free as you make changes. Consider mocking modules during testing to isolate units and control test inputs/outputs effectively.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors and Solutions\n\nHere are some common errors encountered when using AlmondJS and their solutions:\n\n* **`Uncaught Error: Module name \"moduleName\" has not been loaded yet for context: ...`**: This typically indicates a dependency issue. Double-check that `moduleName` is correctly declared as a dependency in the module that's trying to use it.  Ensure that the path to `moduleName` is correct relative to your main module or configured base paths. Also verify that `moduleName` itself is correctly defined as an AMD module.\n\n* **`Uncaught TypeError: ... is not a function`**:  This often means that a module wasn't loaded successfully or that a function you're calling doesn't exist.  Examine the console for other errors that might have preceded this. Check that the module is loaded correctly, using the browser's developer tools to inspect the object that is supposed to contain the function.  Verify that the function name is correctly spelled in your `require` callback.\n\n* **`Uncaught ReferenceError: ... is not defined`**:  Similar to the above, this usually means a variable is not accessible because the module where it is defined has not loaded or is not loaded correctly.  Make sure dependencies are correctly declared and modules are being loaded asynchronously as intended.\n\n* **`404 Not Found` error in the browser's developer console**:  This indicates that the browser couldn't find a specified module file.  Check your file paths within your HTML and AMD module definitions for typos or incorrect relative paths.  If using a build process, make sure the build process has copied all necessary files to the correct location.\n\n* **Modules not loading in the expected order**: While Almond handles dependency resolution, complex dependency graphs can sometimes lead to unexpected ordering issues. Verify your dependency structure carefully to eliminate circular dependencies and ensure a clear, linear flow.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The console is your friend!  Examine the console for error messages, warnings, and other valuable information. The network tab can show loading times and the success/failure of module requests. The sources tab lets you step through your JavaScript code using the debugger.\n\n* **`console.log()` statements:**  Strategically place `console.log()` statements in your modules to trace the flow of execution and inspect variable values.  This helps identify where problems might be arising.  Log module loading messages to verify they are loading in the expected order.\n\n* **Simplify your project:**  If you have a complex project and are struggling to identify a problem, try isolating parts of it.  Create a minimal, reproducible example that demonstrates the problem.  This often helps to pinpoint the source of the error quickly.\n\n* **Check your module paths:**  Ensure all file paths in your HTML and your `define` and `require` calls are correct and relative to the correct base directory.\n\n* **Verify AMD module structure:** Ensure your modules follow the correct AMD pattern using `define` and return values or objects as needed.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Build Issues\n\n* **Check your build tool configuration:**  Carefully review your build tool's configuration file to ensure it's correctly pointing to your AlmondJS file, your modules, and any other necessary dependencies.\n* **Clean your build directory:**  Sometimes leftover files from previous builds can cause problems.  Clean your build directory before running the build process again.\n* **Update your build tools:** Ensure your build tools (e.g., r.js, webpack if used) are up to date. Outdated tools can have bugs or compatibility issues.\n* **Consult the build tool's documentation:**  Build tools often have detailed documentation that provides troubleshooting guidance for common errors.\n* **Examine the build log:**  The build tool usually provides a log file that details the build process.  Examine this log for errors or warnings that can indicate the problem's source.\n\n\n### Community Support Resources\n\nWhile AlmondJS has a smaller community than some larger JavaScript projects, there are still resources available for support:\n\n* **Search for solutions online:** Search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) are often your first and best resource for finding solutions to common problems. Search for specific error messages or keywords related to your issues.\n* **Check GitHub issues:**  If AlmondJS is hosted on GitHub (or a similar platform), look at the issue tracker. Others may have encountered the same problem, and a solution may already exist.  Note: AlmondJS has limited community activity, so solutions may be less readily available compared to more actively maintained projects.\n* **Engage in online forums or communities:** Look for JavaScript or AMD-related forums or communities where you can ask questions. However, remember that community response time and depth of support might be slower for AlmondJS compared to more popularly used projects.\n\n\nRemember to provide a detailed description of your problem when seeking help, including relevant code snippets, error messages, and the steps you've already taken to troubleshoot the issue.  This will help others understand your situation and provide the most relevant assistance.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Glossary of Terms\n\n* **AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition):** A standard for defining modules in JavaScript that emphasizes asynchronous loading, improving performance and responsiveness.\n* **Module:** A self-contained unit of code that encapsulates functionality and data, promoting reusability and maintainability.\n* **Dependency:** A relationship where one module relies on the functionality provided by another module.\n* **Factory Function:**  A function within an AMD module definition that creates and returns the module's value or API.  It receives the module's dependencies as arguments.\n* **Module Loader:** A piece of software (like AlmondJS) responsible for loading and managing JavaScript modules, handling dependencies and ensuring proper execution order.\n* **Build Process:**  The process of preparing code for production deployment.

The core functionality is primarily the `require` function:\n\n**`require(dependencies, callback)`**\n\n* **`dependencies` (Array):** An array of strings representing the module IDs to load.\n* **`callback` (Function):** A function that will be executed after all dependencies have been loaded.  The loaded modules are passed as arguments to the callback function, in the same order they are listed in the `dependencies` array.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nrequire(['moduleA', 'moduleB'], function(moduleA, moduleB) {\n  // Use moduleA and moduleB here.\n});\n```\n\n**`require.config(config)` (Advanced):**  Allows for advanced configuration options.  See the advanced documentation for detailed usage and available configuration parameters.  This is typically only necessary for complex projects or specialized loading needs.\n\n\n### Change Log\n\n(Insert a table or list here detailing version numbers, release dates, and significant changes made in each version of AlmondJS.
