## Introduction

### What is justifiedGallery?

justifiedGallery is a jQuery plugin designed to create beautiful, responsive, and easily customizable photo galleries.  It arranges images in a justified layout, meaning images are sized and positioned to fill the available width evenly, resulting in a clean and visually appealing presentation. Unlike traditional grid layouts, justifiedGallery adapts dynamically to different screen sizes and window resolutions, maintaining its aesthetic appeal on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  It's ideal for showcasing images, portfolios, or any visual content where a balanced and responsive presentation is crucial.


### Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** Automatically adjusts the layout to fit different screen sizes and window resolutions.
* **Justified Layout:**  Evenly distributes images across the available width for a visually appealing presentation.
* **Easy Customization:** Highly customizable via options, allowing control over image spacing, margins, row heights, and more.
* **Image Caption Support:**  Easily display captions for each image.
* **Lightweight:**  Minimal impact on page load time.
* **Cross-browser Compatibility:**  Works across a wide range of modern browsers.
* **Extensible:**  Can be extended with custom functionality through its API.
* **Lazy Loading (Optional):**  Improve initial page load performance by loading images only when they are visible.


### Getting Started

To use justifiedGallery, you'll need to include jQuery and the justifiedGallery script in your HTML file.  Download the plugin from [insert download link here] and include it as follows:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script> <!-- Or your jQuery source -->
<script src="justifiedGallery.min.js"></script> 
```

Then, create a container element for your images.  This container will be targeted by the plugin. Example:

```html
<div id="myGallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2" />
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3" />
  <!-- ... more images ... -->
</div>
```

Finally, initialize the plugin on your container using a simple jQuery call:

```javascript
$("#myGallery").justifiedGallery();
```

This will create a justified gallery using the default settings.  For more advanced customization, refer to the options section in this manual [link to options section].


## Installation and Setup

### Installing via npm or yarn

justifiedGallery is available via npm and yarn.  To install it, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install justifiedgallery
# or
yarn add justifiedgallery
```

After installation, you can import it into your project using your preferred module bundler (e.g., Webpack, Parcel).  For example, using ES6 modules:

```javascript
import justifiedGallery from 'justifiedgallery';
import $ from 'jquery'; //Ensure you also import jQuery

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myGallery').justifiedGallery();
});
```

Remember to adjust the selector `#myGallery` to match the ID of your gallery container.


### Including justifiedGallery in your project

If you prefer not to use a package manager, you can download the `justifiedGallery.min.js` file directly from [Insert download link here].  Include it in your HTML file after including jQuery:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>  <!-- Or your jQuery source -->
<script src="justifiedGallery.min.js"></script>
```

Place this script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag, or within a `$(document).ready()` block to ensure jQuery is loaded before the plugin.

### Basic HTML Structure

Your HTML should include a container element to hold your images.  This container will be targeted by the justifiedGallery plugin.  You can use any suitable HTML element, such as a `<div>` or a `<ul>`.  Images within the container can be added using `<img>` tags.  For example:

```html
<div id="myGallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
  <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
</div>
```

Remember to replace `"image1.jpg"`, `"image2.jpg"`, etc., with the actual paths to your images.  The `alt` attributes are crucial for accessibility.


### Configuration Options

justifiedGallery offers several options to customize the gallery's appearance and behavior.  These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `justifiedGallery()` function.

* **`rowHeight`:** (Number) The height of each row in pixels.  Defaults to 100.
* **`lastRow`:** ('justify' | 'nojustify' | 'left')  How to handle the last row. 'justify' (default) justifies the last row. 'nojustify' stacks images in the last row. 'left' aligns images to the left.
* **`margins`:** (Number) The margin between images in pixels. Defaults to 1.
* **`border`:** (Number) The border width of images in pixels. Defaults to 0.
* **`randomize`:** (Boolean) Randomizes the order of images. Defaults to `false`.
* **`justifyThreshold`:** (Number) The minimum height of a row to justify. Prevents the creation of very short rows.  Defaults to 0.
* **`waitThumbnailsLoad`:** (Boolean) If set to true, the gallery will be re-justified after all thumbnail images have finished loading. Defaults to `true`.
* **`selector`:** (String)  A jQuery selector to target specific elements within the gallery container.  Defaults to `'img'`
* **`target`:** (String)  The container in which the images should be displayed. Defaults to `null`, meaning the images stay in the original container.
* **`rel`:** (String) value for rel attribute of img tags, useful for lightbox.
* **`captions`:** (Boolean) Whether to show captions. Defaults to `false`
* **`captionClass`:** (String) CSS class for captions. Defaults to `'jgallery-caption'`


Example usage with custom options:

```javascript
$("#myGallery").justifiedGallery({
  rowHeight: 150,
  margins: 5,
  lastRow: 'nojustify',
  captions: true
});
```

Refer to the complete list of options and detailed explanations on [Insert link to detailed options documentation here]



## Usage and API

### Creating a justifiedGallery instance

The core functionality of justifiedGallery revolves around creating an instance of the gallery. This is done by calling the `justifiedGallery()` method on a jQuery selection containing the images you want to display.  The method accepts an optional configuration object as its argument.  For example:


```javascript
$("#myGallery").justifiedGallery({
  rowHeight: 120,
  margins: 8
});
```

This code selects the element with the ID "myGallery" and initializes a justifiedGallery instance with a row height of 120 pixels and 8-pixel margins between images.  If no options are provided, the plugin uses default settings.  Remember to include jQuery and the justifiedGallery script in your HTML before using this code (as described in the Installation and Setup section).


### Image Loading and Display

justifiedGallery handles the loading and display of images efficiently. By default (`waitThumbnailsLoad: true`), it waits for all images to load before calculating and applying the justified layout. This ensures the gallery renders correctly.  If you have a large number of images, you might consider setting `waitThumbnailsLoad` to `false` to improve initial rendering speed. The layout will then readjust once the images are fully loaded.  You can also manage image loading manually using the API methods (see below).


### Responsive Design and Behavior

justifiedGallery is inherently responsive.  It recalculates the justified layout whenever the browser window is resized.  This ensures that the gallery always looks its best regardless of screen size. No additional code is required for responsive behavior – it's built-in.  The layout adjusts automatically to maintain an even distribution of images across the available width.


### Customizing the Appearance

You can customize the appearance of your justifiedGallery using CSS.  The plugin applies default classes to the gallery container and its elements, allowing you to style it precisely. You can target the following classes to control aspects of the layout:

* `.justified-gallery`: The main container.
* `.justified-gallery img`: The images within the gallery.
* `.jgallery-caption`: The caption element (if enabled).

You can also customize aspects of the appearance through configuration options like `rowHeight`, `margins`, `border`, and `lastRow` (as detailed in the Configuration Options section).  Use these options to fine-tune spacing, row heights, and the handling of the last row.


### API Methods and Events

justifiedGallery provides a few API methods for controlling and interacting with the gallery instance:

* **`destroy()`:** Removes the justifiedGallery layout and restores the original HTML structure.
* **`rejustify()`:** Recalculates and reapplies the justified layout. This is useful if you dynamically add or remove images from the gallery.
* **`option(name)`:** Returns the value of the specified option.
* **`option(name, value)`:** Sets the value of the specified option and re-justifies the gallery.

**Events:**

justifiedGallery triggers the following events:

* **`jg.complete`:** Fired when the gallery has been completely rendered (all images loaded and layout applied).
* **`jg.resized`:** Fired when the gallery is resized due to browser window resizing.

Example of using the `rejustify()` method:

```javascript
$("#myGallery").justifiedGallery();
// ... later, after adding new images ...
$("#myGallery").justifiedGallery('rejustify');
```

You can listen for events using jQuery's `.on()` method:

```javascript
$("#myGallery").on("jg.complete", function() {
  console.log("justifiedGallery rendering complete!");
});
```

Remember to consult the complete API documentation [Insert Link Here] for further details and examples.


## Customization Options

### Margin and Row Height Adjustment

The core visual aspect of justifiedGallery is controlled by `rowHeight` and `margins`.  These options directly impact the spacing between images and the overall look.

* **`rowHeight`:** This option (a number representing pixels) determines the height of each row in the gallery. Adjusting this value significantly alters the layout's appearance.  Larger values lead to fewer, taller rows; smaller values result in more, shorter rows.  The default value is 100.

* **`margins`:** This option (a number representing pixels) sets the margin between images, both horizontally and vertically.  Increasing this value adds more spacing between images, making the gallery appear less dense. Decreasing it creates a tighter, more compact layout. The default value is 1.


### Image Sizing and Scaling

justifiedGallery doesn't offer direct control over individual image dimensions *before* justification.  It calculates the optimal dimensions for each image to fit the justified layout based on the `rowHeight` and `margins`.  However, you can influence the final displayed size by:

* **Setting `rowHeight`:** As explained above, adjusting `rowHeight` indirectly affects image size, controlling the overall proportion of height to width.

* **Using CSS:**  You can use CSS styles applied to the images themselves (e.g., `max-width`, `max-height`) to constrain their size within the justified layout.  Be aware that this might override some aspects of justifiedGallery's automatic sizing, potentially disrupting the even distribution.  Use this carefully.

* **Pre-processing Images:**  Before adding images to the gallery, you can resize them externally using image processing tools to ensure a more uniform size.


### Caption and Title Handling

justifiedGallery supports captions.  To enable captions, set the `captions` option to `true` during initialization:

```javascript
$("#myGallery").justifiedGallery({ captions: true });
```

The plugin will then automatically use the `alt` attribute of each `<img>` tag as the caption.  If you need more complex caption handling, you can add custom caption elements to your HTML alongside the images.  You can also customize the caption appearance using the `captionClass` option which defaults to `'jgallery-caption'`.

If you don't want to use `alt` text for captions, ensure each image has a sibling element (e.g., a `<p>` tag) that will be treated as the caption. The sibling needs to be right after the `<img>` tag.  The content of this sibling will be used as the caption.

Titles are not directly supported; the `title` attribute of the image is not used by the plugin.  If title information is required, it should be handled separately, possibly by adding it to the custom caption.


### CSS Customization

justifiedGallery uses a set of default CSS classes.  You can fully customize the gallery's appearance through CSS.  The main class is `.justified-gallery`, which targets the gallery container.  Images within the gallery are selected using `.justified-gallery img`.  Captions are styled via the `.jgallery-caption` class (when captions are enabled).  Use these classes to target elements and modify their properties like colors, fonts, margins, padding, and other visual aspects.


### Accessibility Considerations

* **Alt Text:** Always provide meaningful `alt` attributes for your images.  This is crucial for screen readers and is also used for captions by default if `captions` is set to `true`.

* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Ensure your gallery works well with keyboard navigation.  This typically involves adding appropriate ARIA attributes or using standard keyboard-focusable elements.  justifiedGallery itself doesn't inherently handle keyboard navigation; you may need to implement this using additional JavaScript.

* **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 elements where possible to improve the overall accessibility of your page.

* **Color Contrast:**  Pay attention to color contrast between text, backgrounds, and images, ensuring sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.


## Advanced Usage

### Working with Different Image Sizes

justifiedGallery is designed to handle images of varying sizes. It automatically calculates the optimal dimensions for each image to maintain the justified layout. However, significant differences in image aspect ratios can affect the visual balance. For best results:

* **Consistent Aspect Ratios:** Aim for images with relatively consistent aspect ratios within a gallery to prevent extremely tall or short rows.  Pre-processing images to a similar aspect ratio can greatly improve the overall aesthetic.

* **`justifyThreshold` Option:** The `justifyThreshold` option can help manage rows that are too short. By increasing its value (in pixels), you set a minimum row height, preventing the creation of very short rows that may look unbalanced due to disproportionate image sizes.

* **`lastRow` Option:**  The `lastRow` option controls how the last row is handled. If you have a mix of very large and very small images, choosing `'nojustify'` or `'left'` might give better visual results in the final row than the default `'justify'`.


### Handling Large Image Sets

With large image sets, performance becomes crucial.  To optimize performance:

* **Lazy Loading:** While not directly built-in, consider implementing lazy loading to defer the loading of images until they are visible in the viewport.  Numerous lazy-loading libraries can be easily integrated with justifiedGallery. This significantly improves initial page load times.

* **`waitThumbnailsLoad` Option:** Setting `waitThumbnailsLoad` to `false` can speed up the initial rendering. The gallery will be justified initially using placeholder dimensions, and will be re-justified once all images are loaded. This can improve the perceived performance, but there might be a brief visual flicker.

* **Image Optimization:** Optimize your images for web use.  Compress them without excessive quality loss using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim. Smaller image file sizes drastically improve loading speed.

* **Chunking Images:** Consider fetching and displaying images in chunks using techniques like infinite scrolling, rather than loading all images at once.


### Integration with Other Libraries

justifiedGallery is a jQuery plugin and is designed to work well with other jQuery libraries and plugins. Some potential integrations include:

* **Lightboxes:**  Integrate with lightbox libraries (like Fancybox or Magnific Popup) to provide a larger, detailed view of each image when clicked. The `rel` attribute within your image tags can be utilized for this purpose.

* **Lazy Loading Libraries:**  As mentioned above, integrating a lazy loading library can significantly improve performance, especially with many images.

* **Infinite Scroll Plugins:** Combine justifiedGallery with infinite scroll plugins to load images dynamically as the user scrolls down, for very large galleries.

* **Image Carousel/Slider Plugins:** While less common, a combination with image carousels could create a unique gallery experience.  Be mindful of the potential for visual conflicts between the carousel's mechanics and justifiedGallery's layout.


### Performance Optimization

Beyond the strategies mentioned above (lazy loading and handling large image sets), you can further optimize performance by:

* **Minification:** Use a minifier to reduce the size of your JavaScript files.

* **Caching:** Leverage browser caching effectively to reduce server requests.

* **Efficient CSS:** Write efficient CSS to avoid unnecessary reflows and repaints.  Minimize the complexity of your CSS selectors.

* **Profiling:**  Use browser developer tools to profile your page's performance and identify bottlenecks.


### Debugging and Troubleshooting

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML structure and CSS styles.  Check the console for JavaScript errors.

* **jQuery Console:** If using jQuery, use the jQuery console to execute commands and inspect the state of the gallery elements.

* **Check jQuery Version:**  Ensure you are using a compatible version of jQuery.

* **Verify Plugin Inclusion:** Double-check that the justifiedGallery script is included correctly and that jQuery is loaded before it.

* **Check for Conflicts:**  Look for potential conflicts with other JavaScript libraries on your page.

* **Test with Different Browsers:**  Test the gallery on various browsers to catch any cross-browser compatibility issues.  If encountering issues with a specific browser, it is beneficial to look at the browser's developer tools' console to find any errors.




## Examples and Use Cases

### Basic Gallery Implementation

This example shows a simple implementation of justifiedGallery.  It requires only including the necessary scripts (jQuery and justifiedGallery) and initializing the plugin on a container holding your images:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>justifiedGallery Example</title>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="justifiedGallery.min.js"></script> </head>
<body>

<div id="myGallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
  <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
</div>

<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("#myGallery").justifiedGallery();
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Remember to replace `"image1.jpg"`, `"image2.jpg"`, etc., with the actual paths to your images.


### Gallery with Captions

To display captions below each image, set the `captions` option to `true` and ensure your images have `alt` attributes:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>justifiedGallery with Captions</title>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="justifiedGallery.min.js"></script>
<style>
  .jgallery-caption {
    font-size: 14px;
    color: #333;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div id="myGallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="A majestic mountain range">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="A vibrant city skyline">
</div>

<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("#myGallery").justifiedGallery({ captions: true });
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

The added CSS styles the captions.  You can also use sibling elements for more complex caption control, as described in the Customization Options section.


### Responsive Gallery Implementation

justifiedGallery is inherently responsive.  No additional code is needed for a responsive gallery. The layout will automatically adapt to different screen sizes:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Responsive justifiedGallery</title>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="justifiedGallery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="myGallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("#myGallery").justifiedGallery();
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This example will work responsively without any additional code because justifiedGallery automatically adjusts its layout on window resize.


### Custom Styling Example

This example shows how to customize the gallery's appearance using CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Custom Styled justifiedGallery</title>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="justifiedGallery.min.js"></script>
<style>
  #myGallery {
    border: 5px solid #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
  }
  #myGallery img {
    border: 2px solid #eee;
    margin: 5px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div id="myGallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("#myGallery").justifiedGallery({ margins: 10 }); // Example of using the margins option
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This CSS adds a border and padding to the container and a border to the individual images, demonstrating how to style the gallery beyond the default appearance.  Remember to adjust paths to your images.
