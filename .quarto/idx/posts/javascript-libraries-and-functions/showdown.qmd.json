It's a powerful and versatile library that allows you to easily integrate Markdown support into your web applications.  It's lightweight, fast, and supports a wide range of Markdown features, making it suitable for a variety of use cases, from simple blog posts to complex documentation websites. Showdown focuses on a clean and straightforward API, making it simple to integrate and use.  It doesn't rely on external dependencies, offering a self-contained solution for Markdown conversion.\n\n\n### Why use Showdown?\n\n* **Lightweight and Fast:** Showdown is designed for performance. Its small footprint and efficient conversion process ensure minimal impact on your application's speed and resources.\n\n* **Extensive Markdown Support:** It handles a broad spectrum of Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, tables, code blocks, links, images, and more, providing a rich and versatile Markdown experience.\n\n* **Easy Integration:**  Showdown has a simple and intuitive API, making it straightforward to integrate into existing JavaScript projects.  Its minimal dependencies simplify the integration process and reduce potential conflicts.\n\n* **Customization Options:**  While offering robust default behavior, Showdown also provides options for customization, allowing you to tailor its functionality to meet your specific needs. This includes extending the parser with custom extensions.\n\n* **Open Source and Well-Maintained:** Showdown is an open-source project with an active community, ensuring ongoing development, updates, and support.\n\n\n### Setting up Showdown.\n\nShowdown can be included in your project in several ways:\n\n* **Using a CDN:** The simplest way is to include Showdown via a CDN like jsDelivr:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/showdown@2.1.0/dist/showdown.min.js\"></script>\n```\nReplace `2.1.0` with the desired version number.\n\n* **Using npm (Node Package Manager):** If you're using npm, install Showdown with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install showdown\n```\n\nThen, you can import it into your JavaScript code:\n\n```javascript\nimport showdown from 'showdown';\n// Or, if using CommonJS:\nconst showdown = require('showdown');\n```\n\n* **Downloading the library:** You can download the `showdown.min.js` file directly from the Showdown GitHub repository and include it in your project using a `<script>` tag.\n\nAfter including Showdown, you can create a converter instance and convert your Markdown text to HTML:\n\n```javascript\nlet converter = new showdown.Converter();\nlet html = converter.makeHtml('Your Markdown text here');\ndocument.getElementById('output').innerHTML = html;\n```\nRemember to have an element with the id \"output\" in your HTML to display the converted HTML.  Further customization options, such as configuring extensions, are detailed in the subsequent sections of this manual.\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Converting Markdown to HTML\n\nThe core functionality of Showdown revolves around converting Markdown text into HTML.  This is accomplished using the `Converter` object and its `makeHtml()` method.\n\nFirst, create a new converter instance:\n\n```javascript\nlet converter = new showdown.Converter();\n```\n\nThen, pass your Markdown text to the `makeHtml()` method:\n\n```javascript\nlet markdownText = \"# This is a heading\\n\\nThis is a paragraph.\";\nlet html = converter.makeHtml(markdownText);\nconsole.log(html); // Outputs the corresponding HTML\n```\n\nThe resulting `html` variable will contain the HTML representation of your Markdown input. You can then insert this HTML into your webpage using JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities, for example, by setting the `innerHTML` property of an element:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById('output').innerHTML = html;\n```\n\n\n### Basic Markdown Syntax\n\nShowdown supports a wide range of Markdown syntax.  Generally, Markdown uses plain text formatting conventions to structure documents.  Key aspects include using specific characters or symbols to denote headings, paragraphs, lists, emphasis, and other elements.  Whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is generally significant in structuring the content, but excessive whitespace is often ignored.\n\n\n### Headers\n\nHeaders are created using `#` symbols. The number of `#` symbols determines the header level (h1-h6):\n\n```markdown\n# Heading 1\n## Heading 2\n### Heading 3\n#### Heading 4\n##### Heading 5\n###### Heading 6\n```\n\n\n### Paragraphs\n\nParagraphs are created by separating lines of text with one or more blank lines.  Showdown automatically wraps sequences of non-blank lines into `<p>` tags.\n\n```markdown\nThis is a paragraph.\n\nThis is another paragraph.\n```\n\n\n### Emphasis\n\nEmphasis is achieved using asterisks (*) or underscores (_):\n\n* **Bold:** `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`\n* *Italic:* `*italic text*` or `_italic text_`\n* ***Bold italic:*** `***bold italic text***` or `___bold italic text___`\n\n\n### Lists\n\nUnordered lists use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-):\n\n```markdown\n* Item 1\n* Item 2\n* Item 3\n```\n\nOrdered lists use numbers followed by a period (.) :\n\n```markdown\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n3. Item 3\n```\n\n\n### Links\n\nLinks are created using square brackets `[]` for the link text and parentheses `()` for the URL:\n\n```markdown\n[Link text](https://www.example.com)\n```\n\nYou can also specify a title attribute:\n\n```markdown\n[Link text with title](https://www.example.com \"Title text\")\n```\n\n\n### Images\n\nImages are similar to links, but use an exclamation mark `!` before the square brackets:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)\n```\n\nYou can also specify a title attribute:\n\n```markdown\n![Alt text with title](https://www.example.com/image.jpg \"Title text\")\n```\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Code Blocks\n\nCode blocks are created using triple backticks (```) or indented four spaces:\n\n**Triple backticks:**  This method allows for specifying a language for syntax highlighting (although Showdown itself doesn't perform the highlighting;  that would require a separate syntax highlighter library).\n\n```\n```javascript\nfunction myFunction() {\n  // Some JavaScript code\n}\n```\n```\n\n**Indented four spaces:**\n\n```\n    This is a code block using indentation.\n```\n\n### Blockquotes\n\nBlockquotes are created using the `>` character at the beginning of each line:\n\n```markdown\n> This is a blockquote.\n> It can span multiple lines.\n```\n\n\n### Horizontal Rules\n\nHorizontal rules are created using three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`) on a line by themselves:\n\n```markdown\n---\n***\n___\n```\n\n\n### Tables\n\nTables are created using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`):\n\n```markdown\n| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Row 1, Cell 1 | Row 1, Cell 2 | Row 1, Cell 3 |\n| Row 2, Cell 1 | Row 2, Cell 2 | Row 2, Cell 3 |\n```\n\nYou can optionally align columns by adding colons (`:`) to the hyphens in the header row:\n\n* Left-aligned: `| Header 1 |:---|`\n* Center-aligned: `| Header 2 |:---:|`\n* Right-aligned: `| Header 3 |---|:`\n\n\n### HTML Entities\n\nShowdown allows the inclusion of HTML entities directly in your Markdown:\n\n```markdown\n&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph using HTML entities.&lt;/p&gt;\n```\n\n\n### Escaping Markdown Syntax\n\nTo include literal Markdown characters without them being interpreted, escape them using a backslash (`\\`):\n\n```markdown\n\\*This is not italicized\\*.\n```\n\n\n### Footnotes\n\nShowdown supports footnotes using the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\nHere's a sentence with a footnote.<sup>[1]</sup>\n\n[1]: This is the footnote.\n```\n\n\n### Definitions\n\nShowdown supports definition lists:\n\n```markdown\nterm 1\n: definition 1\n\nterm 2\n: definition 2\n```\n\n\n## Extensions\n\nShowdown's functionality can be extended through the use of extensions. Extensions add support for features not included in the core Markdown specification, or modify the default behavior of the converter.\n\n### Enabling Extensions\n\nExtensions are enabled when creating the `Converter` instance.  You pass an array of extension names to the `extensions` option:\n\n```javascript\nlet converter = new showdown.Converter({ extensions: ['exampleExtension', 'anotherExtension'] });\nlet html = converter.makeHtml(markdownText);\n```\n\nReplace `'exampleExtension'` and `'anotherExtension'` with the actual names of the extensions you want to enable.  Make sure the extension files are included in your project before using them.  The exact method for including extensions will depend on how you've included Showdown (e.g., via CDN, npm, etc.).\n\n\n### Available Extensions\n\nShowdown itself doesn't include built-in extensions in the same way some Markdown processors do.  The availability and functionality of extensions largely depend on community-contributed extensions or those you might create yourself.  You'll typically find information about available extensions on the Showdown project page or through community resources.  There isn't a central repository maintained by the Showdown project itself for extensions.\n\n\n### Custom Extensions\n\nShowdown allows creating custom extensions to add new Markdown syntax or modify existing behavior.  This typically involves creating a JavaScript object that conforms to Showdown's extension API.  The API details are documented separately (often within the Showdown project repository or documentation) and typically involve extending the parser or renderer to handle new syntax or modify the output.  A custom extension would generally include methods to handle the new markdown element(s), such as:\n\n* `extendParser(parser)`:  Modifies the parser to recognize and handle the new syntax.\n* `extendRenderer(renderer)`: Modifies the renderer to generate the appropriate HTML output.\n\n\n### Extension Options\n\nSome extensions may offer configuration options. These options are passed as part of the `extensions` array using an object with the extension name as the key and an object containing the options as the value:\n\n```javascript\nlet converter = new showdown.Converter({\n  extensions: [\n    {\n      type: 'output',\n      name: 'myExtension',\n      options: {\n        myOption: 'myValue'\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nThe specific options available depend entirely on the particular extension being used; consult the extension's documentation for details.  Note that the structure and required properties of the option object may differ based on how the extension is designed.  The example above demonstrates one possible structure; you might need to adapt it based on the API defined by the extension.\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nShowdown offers several ways to configure its behavior, allowing you to customize the Markdown parsing and HTML generation process.\n\n### Global Configuration\n\nGlobal configuration affects all instances of the `showdown.Converter` created.  This is generally done by setting properties directly on the `showdown` object *before* creating any converter instances.  However, note that this approach isn't officially supported or documented by the Showdown library, and its use might lead to unforeseen issues in larger projects or with future versions.   It's generally recommended to favor per-conversion configuration for better control and maintainability.\n\n### Per-Conversion Configuration\n\nThe preferred and recommended method of configuring Showdown is to pass options when creating a new `showdown.Converter` instance.  This approach ensures that each converter instance has its own independent configuration, preventing conflicts and making your code more organized and easier to manage.  Options are provided as a JavaScript object to the constructor.\n\n```javascript\nlet converter = new showdown.Converter({\n    // Configuration options here\n});\n```\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nSeveral configuration options are available, affecting various aspects of the conversion process.  Some common options include:\n\n* `flavor`:  Specifies the Markdown flavor to use (e.g., 'github', 'original').  This option affects the interpretation of certain Markdown syntax elements.\n* `extensions`: An array of extension names to enable (as detailed in the Extensions section).\n* `simplifiedAutoLink`:  Controls how automatic linking is handled.\n* `excludeTrailingPunctuationFromURLs`:  Determines whether trailing punctuation should be excluded from URLs when automatically linking.\n* `strikethrough`: Enables or disables support for strikethrough syntax (~~text~~).\n* `tables`: Enables or disables support for tables.\n* `tasklists`: Enables or disables support for task lists.\n* `smartIndentationFix`: Attempt to fix the common issue of nested lists not working correctly when indentation is inconsistent.\n\n\n\nThe exact options available and their effects may vary across different Showdown versions. Consult the official Showdown documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive list of configuration options and their descriptions.\n\n\n### Default Options\n\nShowdown has a set of default options that are used if you don't specify any options when creating a converter.  These defaults provide a reasonable balance of features and compatibility.  To know the exact default values for a given Showdown version, check its documentation.  Generally, the defaults tend to favor a reasonably broad range of Markdown features, providing good compatibility with many Markdown styles.  However, if you have specific requirements or want to ensure consistency with a particular Markdown standard (such as GitHub Flavored Markdown), overriding the default options via the `showdown.Converter` constructor is the best approach.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the Showdown API, focusing on the core `Converter` object and its associated methods.  Note that the specific methods and their behavior may vary slightly depending on the Showdown version.  Always refer to the official Showdown documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive API reference.\n\n\n### Showdown.Converter\n\nThe `showdown.Converter` class is the primary object used for converting Markdown to HTML.  It's instantiated with optional configuration options (see the Configuration section).  All conversion methods are called on a `Converter` instance.  Creating a new instance is the first step in using Showdown:\n\n```javascript\nconst converter = new showdown.Converter({ /* options */ });\n```\n\n\n### Converter.makeHtml\n\nThis is the core method for converting Markdown text to HTML.  It takes the Markdown text as a string and returns the corresponding HTML as a string.\n\n```javascript\nconst markdown = \"# My Heading\\n\\nThis is some text.\";\nconst html = converter.makeHtml(markdown);\nconsole.log(html); // Output: The generated HTML\n```\n\n\n### Converter.setFlavor\n\nSets the Markdown flavor to be used.  Common flavors include 'github' (GitHub Flavored Markdown) and 'original' (a more basic flavor).  This method influences the parsing of certain Markdown syntax elements.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.setFlavor('github');\n```\n\n\n### Converter.setOption\n\nSets an individual configuration option.  This method allows modifying specific options without having to re-create the Converter instance.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.setOption('simplifiedAutoLink', true);\n```\n\n\n### Converter.addExtension\n\nAdds a new extension to the converter.  This method allows extending the functionality of Showdown dynamically.  The argument should be an object conforming to the Showdown extension API.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.addExtension(myCustomExtension);\n```\n\n\n### Converter.removeExtension\n\nRemoves a previously added extension from the converter.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.removeExtension('myExtension');\n```\n\n\n### Converter.getFlavor\n\nReturns the currently set Markdown flavor.\n\n```javascript\nconst currentFlavor = converter.getFlavor();\nconsole.log(currentFlavor); // Output: The current flavor (e.g., 'github')\n```\n\n\n### Converter.getOptions\n\nReturns all the currently set options for the converter as a single object. This allows introspection of the current configuration.\n\n```javascript\nconst options = converter.getOptions();\nconsole.log(options); // Output: An object containing all options and their values.\n```\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThis section provides guidance on resolving common issues encountered while using Showdown.\n\n### Common Errors\n\n* **Incorrect Markdown Syntax:**  The most frequent errors stem from incorrect Markdown syntax. Carefully review your Markdown text for typos, inconsistencies, and adherence to the Markdown specification.  Use a Markdown linter or validator if available to help identify syntax errors.\n\n* **Extension Conflicts:** If using multiple extensions, conflicts might arise. Ensure that extensions are compatible and don't interfere with each other.  Try disabling extensions one by one to isolate the source of the problem.\n\n* **Incorrect HTML Output:**  If the generated HTML is not as expected, check the configuration options, especially those related to Markdown flavor and enabled extensions.  Ensure that the HTML is being correctly inserted into your webpage's DOM.\n\n* **JavaScript Errors:**  If you encounter JavaScript errors in your browser's console, examine the error messages carefully.  They often pinpoint the location and cause of the problem, potentially related to Showdown's usage or integration with your code.\n\n* **Version Mismatches:** Make sure the Showdown version you're using is compatible with your other libraries and dependencies. Version conflicts can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Console Logging:**  Use `console.log()` statements to inspect the Markdown input, the intermediate parsing steps (if possible), and the final HTML output.  This helps track the conversion process and identify where errors occur.\n\n* **Simplified Test Cases:**  Reduce your Markdown to a minimal example that still reproduces the problem.  This simplifies debugging and makes it easier to pinpoint the problematic Markdown syntax or configuration.\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the generated HTML, examine the console for JavaScript errors, and step through your code using the debugger.\n\n* **Check Showdown's Documentation:** The official Showdown documentation provides detailed information about usage, options, and potential issues.  Make sure to consult this resource before seeking help elsewhere.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Extensions\n\nIf you're experiencing problems with extensions:\n\n* **Verify Installation:** Ensure the extensions are correctly installed and included in your project.\n\n* **Check Extension Documentation:**  Consult the documentation for the specific extension you are using.  It may provide information about common problems and their solutions.\n\n* **Test Individually:** Disable all extensions except for the one causing the issue to rule out conflicts.\n\n* **Examine Extension Code:** If you have access to the extension's source code, inspect it for potential errors or incompatibilities.\n\n\n### Community Support\n\nIf you can't resolve the issue after trying the above steps, seek help from the Showdown community.  You might find solutions in online forums, issue trackers, or by posting a question on a relevant programming Q&A site.  Make sure to provide relevant information such as:\n\n* Showdown version\n* Relevant code snippets\n* Markdown input\n* Expected output\n* Actual output\n* Browser and operating system details\n\n\nRemember to search existing resources before asking for help, as your problem may already have a known solution.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis section outlines how to contribute to the Showdown project.\n\n### Contributing to Showdown\n\nContributions to Showdown are welcome and encouraged!

This typically involves creating a JavaScript object that conforms to Showdown's extension API.  The API details are documented separately (often within the Showdown project repository or documentation) and typically involve extending the parser or renderer to handle new syntax or modify the output.  A custom extension would generally include methods to handle the new markdown element(s), such as:\n\n* `extendParser(parser)`:  Modifies the parser to recognize and handle the new syntax.\n* `extendRenderer(renderer)`: Modifies the renderer to generate the appropriate HTML output.\n\n\n### Extension Options\n\nSome extensions may offer configuration options. These options are passed as part of the `extensions` array using an object with the extension name as the key and an object containing the options as the value:\n\n```javascript\nlet converter = new showdown.Converter({\n  extensions: [\n    {\n      type: 'output',\n      name: 'myExtension',\n      options: {\n        myOption: 'myValue'\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nThe specific options available depend entirely on the particular extension being used; consult the extension's documentation for details.  Note that the structure and required properties of the option object may differ based on how the extension is designed.  The example above demonstrates one possible structure; you might need to adapt it based on the API defined by the extension.\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nShowdown offers several ways to configure its behavior, allowing you to customize the Markdown parsing and HTML generation process.\n\n### Global Configuration\n\nGlobal configuration affects all instances of the `showdown.Converter` created.  This is generally done by setting properties directly on the `showdown` object *before* creating any converter instances.  However, note that this approach isn't officially supported or documented by the Showdown library, and its use might lead to unforeseen issues in larger projects or with future versions.   It's generally recommended to favor per-conversion configuration for better control and maintainability.\n\n### Per-Conversion Configuration\n\nThe preferred and recommended method of configuring Showdown is to pass options when creating a new `showdown.Converter` instance.  This approach ensures that each converter instance has its own independent configuration, preventing conflicts and making your code more organized and easier to manage.  Options are provided as a JavaScript object to the constructor.\n\n```javascript\nlet converter = new showdown.Converter({\n    // Configuration options here\n});\n```\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nSeveral configuration options are available, affecting various aspects of the conversion process.  Some common options include:\n\n* `flavor`:  Specifies the Markdown flavor to use (e.g., 'github', 'original').  This option affects the interpretation of certain Markdown syntax elements.\n* `extensions`: An array of extension names to enable (as detailed in the Extensions section).\n* `simplifiedAutoLink`:  Controls how automatic linking is handled.\n* `excludeTrailingPunctuationFromURLs`:  Determines whether trailing punctuation should be excluded from URLs when automatically linking.\n* `strikethrough`: Enables or disables support for strikethrough syntax (~~text~~).\n* `tables`: Enables or disables support for tables.\n* `tasklists`: Enables or disables support for task lists.\n* `smartIndentationFix`: Attempt to fix the common issue of nested lists not working correctly when indentation is inconsistent.\n\n\n\nThe exact options available and their effects may vary across different Showdown versions. Consult the official Showdown documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive list of configuration options and their descriptions.\n\n\n### Default Options\n\nShowdown has a set of default options that are used if you don't specify any options when creating a converter.  These defaults provide a reasonable balance of features and compatibility.  To know the exact default values for a given Showdown version, check its documentation.  Generally, the defaults tend to favor a reasonably broad range of Markdown features, providing good compatibility with many Markdown styles.  However, if you have specific requirements or want to ensure consistency with a particular Markdown standard (such as GitHub Flavored Markdown), overriding the default options via the `showdown.Converter` constructor is the best approach.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the Showdown API, focusing on the core `Converter` object and its associated methods.  Note that the specific methods and their behavior may vary slightly depending on the Showdown version.  Always refer to the official Showdown documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive API reference.\n\n\n### Showdown.Converter\n\nThe `showdown.Converter` class is the primary object used for converting Markdown to HTML.  It's instantiated with optional configuration options (see the Configuration section).  All conversion methods are called on a `Converter` instance.  Creating a new instance is the first step in using Showdown:\n\n```javascript\nconst converter = new showdown.Converter({ /* options */ });\n```\n\n\n### Converter.makeHtml\n\nThis is the core method for converting Markdown text to HTML.  It takes the Markdown text as a string and returns the corresponding HTML as a string.\n\n```javascript\nconst markdown = \"# My Heading\\n\\nThis is some text.\";\nconst html = converter.makeHtml(markdown);\nconsole.log(html); // Output: The generated HTML\n```\n\n\n### Converter.setFlavor\n\nSets the Markdown flavor to be used.  Common flavors include 'github' (GitHub Flavored Markdown) and 'original' (a more basic flavor).  This method influences the parsing of certain Markdown syntax elements.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.setFlavor('github');\n```\n\n\n### Converter.setOption\n\nSets an individual configuration option.  This method allows modifying specific options without having to re-create the Converter instance.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.setOption('simplifiedAutoLink', true);\n```\n\n\n### Converter.addExtension\n\nAdds a new extension to the converter.  This method allows extending the functionality of Showdown dynamically.  The argument should be an object conforming to the Showdown extension API.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.addExtension(myCustomExtension);\n```\n\n\n### Converter.removeExtension\n\nRemoves a previously added extension from the converter.\n\n```javascript\nconverter.removeExtension('myExtension');\n```\n\n\n### Converter.getFlavor\n\nReturns the currently set Markdown flavor.\n\n```javascript\nconst currentFlavor = converter.getFlavor();\nconsole.log(currentFlavor); // Output: The current flavor (e.g., 'github')\n```\n\n\n### Converter.getOptions\n\nReturns all the currently set options for the converter as a single object. This allows introspection of the current configuration.\n\n```javascript\nconst options = converter.getOptions();\nconsole.log(options); // Output: An object containing all options and their values.\n```\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThis section provides guidance on resolving common issues encountered while using Showdown.\n\n### Common Errors\n\n* **Incorrect Markdown Syntax:**  The most frequent errors stem from incorrect Markdown syntax. Carefully review your Markdown text for typos, inconsistencies, and adherence to the Markdown specification.  Use a Markdown linter or validator if available to help identify syntax errors.\n\n* **Extension Conflicts:** If using multiple extensions, conflicts might arise. Ensure that extensions are compatible and don't interfere with each other.  Try disabling extensions one by one to isolate the source of the problem.\n\n* **Incorrect HTML Output:**  If the generated HTML is not as expected, check the configuration options, especially those related to Markdown flavor and enabled extensions.  Ensure that the HTML is being correctly inserted into your webpage's DOM.\n\n* **JavaScript Errors:**  If you encounter JavaScript errors in your browser's console, examine the error messages carefully.  They often pinpoint the location and cause of the problem, potentially related to Showdown's usage or integration with your code.\n\n* **Version Mismatches:** Make sure the Showdown version you're using is compatible with your other libraries and dependencies. Version conflicts can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Console Logging:**  Use `console.log()` statements to inspect the Markdown input, the intermediate parsing steps (if possible), and the final HTML output.  This helps track the conversion process and identify where errors occur.\n\n* **Simplified Test Cases:**  Reduce your Markdown to a minimal example that still reproduces the problem.  This simplifies debugging and makes it easier to pinpoint the problematic Markdown syntax or configuration.\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the generated HTML, examine the console for JavaScript errors, and step through your code using the debugger.\n\n* **Check Showdown's Documentation:** The official Showdown documentation provides detailed information about usage, options, and potential issues.  Make sure to consult this resource before seeking help elsewhere.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Extensions\n\nIf you're experiencing problems with extensions:\n\n* **Verify Installation:** Ensure the extensions are correctly installed and included in your project.\n\n* **Check Extension Documentation:**  Consult the documentation for the specific extension you are using.  It may provide information about common problems and their solutions.\n\n* **Test Individually:** Disable all extensions except for the one causing the issue to rule out conflicts.\n\n* **Examine Extension Code:** If you have access to the extension's source code, inspect it for potential errors or incompatibilities.\n\n\n### Community Support\n\nIf you can't resolve the issue after trying the above steps, seek help from the Showdown community.  You might find solutions in online forums, issue trackers, or by posting a question on a relevant programming Q&A site.  Make sure to provide relevant information such as:\n\n* Showdown version\n* Relevant code snippets\n* Markdown input\n* Expected output\n* Actual output\n* Browser and operating system details\n\n\nRemember to search existing resources before asking for help, as your problem may already have a known solution.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis section outlines how to contribute to the Showdown project.\n\n### Contributing to Showdown\n\nContributions to Showdown are welcome and encouraged!
