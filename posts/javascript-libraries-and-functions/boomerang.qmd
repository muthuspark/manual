Further detailed instructions and examples are given in the subsequent sections for each supported language.


## Core Concepts

### Requests and Responses

Boomerang's core functionality revolves around the exchange of requests and responses.  A *request* represents a task or operation that needs to be performed.  It typically contains the necessary data and parameters for the task. A *response* contains the result of the operation and may include status codes indicating success or failure.  Both requests and responses are encapsulated in standardized data structures (details below), facilitating interoperability between different components of the system and across different programming languages.  Requests are submitted to the Boomerang system, processed asynchronously, and the corresponding responses are delivered back to the client. The specific format of requests and responses will depend on the type of operation being performed.

### The Boomerang API

The Boomerang API provides a consistent interface for interacting with the Boomerang system.  It offers functions for:

* **Submitting requests:** Sending requests to the Boomerang system for processing.
* **Receiving responses:** Retrieving the results of processed requests.
* **Managing resources:** Allocating and releasing resources efficiently.
* **Monitoring system status:** Tracking the performance and health of the Boomerang system.

The API is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, regardless of the programming language.  Each language binding provides a specific implementation of the API, while maintaining the same core functionality.  Detailed documentation and examples for each language are available in the respective language-specific sections of this manual.


### Data Structures

Boomerang uses several key data structures for representing requests, responses, and other relevant information.  These structures are designed for efficiency and ease of use.  Key data structures include:

* **Request Object:** Contains the details of the operation to be performed, including any necessary parameters or data. This may be implemented differently depending on the programming language (e.g., a class in Java, a dictionary in Python).
* **Response Object:** Encapsulates the results of the operation, including a status code indicating success or failure, and any data returned by the operation.
* **Message Queue:**  An internal data structure used to manage pending requests and responses.
* **Worker Pool:** The set of worker threads that process requests concurrently.

The precise structure and contents of these objects will be detailed in the language-specific sections of the manual.  In general, they are designed to be easily serializable and deserializable for efficient communication between components.


### Error Handling

Boomerang incorporates a robust error-handling mechanism to manage exceptions and failures gracefully.  Errors are propagated through the system using standardized error codes and messages.  The Boomerang API provides methods for checking the status of responses and handling errors appropriately.  Typical error scenarios include network issues, resource exhaustion, and failures within the processing logic.  The system is designed to isolate failures to prevent cascading effects, ensuring the resilience of the overall system.  Detailed information on specific error codes and how to handle them is provided in the appendix.

### Asynchronous Operations

Boomerang excels at handling asynchronous operations. When a request is submitted, the client does not block while waiting for the response.  Instead, it receives a handle (e.g., a future object or promise) that can be used to retrieve the result asynchronously at a later time. This non-blocking behavior is essential for building highly responsive and scalable applications.  The Boomerang system manages the concurrency internally, using a worker pool to process requests concurrently without blocking the main thread.   This allows the client to continue processing other tasks while the request is being handled, maximizing resource utilization and application throughput.  The asynchronous nature of Boomerang's operations is fundamental to its efficiency and scalability.


## Working with Boomerang

### Creating a Boomerang Project

Creating a Boomerang project involves several steps, dependent on your chosen programming language.  General steps include:

1. **Project Setup:** Create a new project directory and initialize it appropriately for your language (e.g., using Maven for Java, `pipenv` for Python, or `go mod init` for Go).

2. **Dependency Management:** Add the Boomerang library as a dependency.  This involves adding the appropriate lines to your project's `pom.xml` (Maven), `requirements.txt` (pip), or `go.mod` (Go) files.  Specific instructions for each language are provided in the language-specific sections.

3. **Import Statements:** In your source code, import the necessary Boomerang modules or packages.  Again, the exact import statements will be language-dependent.

4. **Configuration (Optional):**  Depending on your needs, you may need to configure Boomerang's parameters (e.g., the size of the worker pool, logging levels, etc.).  This is usually done via configuration files or programmatically.


### Basic Usage Examples

Here are basic examples demonstrating the core functionality of Boomerang.  These examples are conceptual and will need to be adapted to the specifics of your chosen language.

**Submitting a simple request and receiving a response:**

```java
// Conceptual Java example
BoomerangClient client = new BoomerangClient();
Request request = new Request("myTask", "someData");
Response response = client.submitRequest(request);
//Process response.getData()
```

```python
# Conceptual Python example
client = BoomerangClient()
request = Request("myTask", data="someData")
response = client.submit(request)
# Process response['data']
```

```go
// Conceptual Go example
client := BoomerangClient{}
request := Request{"myTask", "someData"}
response := client.Submit(request)
// Process response.Data
```

These examples show the basic flow of submitting a request and receiving a response.  The specific details (like the exact structure of `Request` and `Response` objects) will be explained in the relevant language sections.

### Advanced Usage Examples

Advanced usage involves more complex scenarios such as:

* **Handling asynchronous responses:** Using callbacks or futures to process responses asynchronously without blocking the main thread.  Examples demonstrating this will be provided in the language-specific documentation.
* **Customizing request handling:** Implementing custom request handlers to process specific types of requests.
* **Resource management:** Efficiently managing resources, such as database connections or network sockets, within the Boomerang framework.  This often involves using the provided resource management APIs.
* **Error handling and recovery:** Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to manage failures gracefully.
* **Building complex workflows:** Orchestrating multiple requests to build complex processing pipelines.



### Integrating with Other Libraries

Boomerang is designed to integrate seamlessly with other libraries and frameworks.  For instance, you could integrate it with database libraries for persistent storage, messaging queues for asynchronous communication, or logging frameworks for detailed system monitoring.  The specifics of integration will depend on the libraries you choose and the programming language you are using.  Examples integrating Boomerang with popular libraries will be provided in the advanced usage sections of the language-specific documentation.  Remember to pay attention to potential concurrency issues when integrating with other asynchronous libraries, ensuring consistent data handling and error management.


## Advanced Techniques

### Customizing Boomerang

Boomerang offers several points for customization to tailor its behavior to specific application needs.  These customizations can significantly impact performance, resource utilization, and error handling. Key areas for customization include:

* **Worker Pool Configuration:**  Adjusting the size of the worker pool to optimize concurrency based on the application's workload and available resources.  Too few workers can lead to underutilization, while too many can introduce excessive overhead.  The optimal size often requires experimentation and benchmarking.

* **Request Handlers:** Implementing custom request handlers to process specific request types or to integrate with specialized services.  This allows for flexible handling of diverse tasks within the Boomerang framework.

* **Resource Management Policies:**  Defining custom resource management strategies for efficient allocation and release of shared resources like database connections or network handles. This is crucial for preventing resource leaks and maximizing performance in resource-constrained environments.

* **Developing Language Bindings:**  For languages currently unsupported by Boomerang, extending the framework by developing new language bindings allows for wider adoption and interoperability.  This requires a good understanding of Boomerang's internal architecture and the target language.

* **Plugin Architecture (Future Development):**  A future planned development is a plugin architecture, allowing developers to add new functionalities and integrations without modifying the core Boomerang code.


### Performance Optimization

Optimizing Boomerang's performance requires careful consideration of several factors:

* **Worker Pool Sizing:**  As mentioned earlier, determining the optimal size of the worker pool is crucial.  Benchmarking under various workloads is essential to find the sweet spot that balances concurrency and overhead.

* **Efficient Request Handling:**  Designing efficient request handlers that minimize processing time and resource consumption is paramount.  This may involve optimizing algorithms, using appropriate data structures, and minimizing external calls.

* **Resource Management:**  Efficiently managing shared resources, such as database connections or network sockets, is vital for preventing bottlenecks and maximizing throughput.

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Leveraging asynchronous operations throughout the application can significantly improve performance by allowing concurrent processing of multiple tasks.

* **Profiling and Benchmarking:**  Using profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and benchmarking different configurations to evaluate the impact of optimization strategies are crucial for achieving optimal performance.


### Debugging and Troubleshooting

Debugging Boomerang applications may require a combination of techniques:

* **Logging:**  Leveraging detailed logging to track the flow of requests and responses, identify errors, and diagnose performance problems.  Implementing custom logging handlers allows for more targeted and informative logging.

* **Profiling:** Using profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks.  This helps isolate areas needing optimization.

* **Monitoring:** Employing monitoring tools to track application performance metrics, such as request processing time, resource utilization, and error rates.  This provides a high-level view of application health and performance.

* **Debugging Tools:**  Utilizing language-specific debugging tools to step through code, inspect variables, and analyze program behavior.  This allows for granular debugging of individual components.

* **Error Handling:**  Carefully reviewing and handling exceptions and errors to ensure that the application gracefully handles failures and recovers from unexpected situations.  This requires robust error handling mechanisms and proper logging of error events.


## API Reference

This section provides a detailed reference for the Boomerang API.  The specific syntax and examples will vary depending on the chosen programming language. Refer to the language-specific sections for detailed examples and code snippets.

### Request Methods

The core of the Boomerang API revolves around submitting requests and receiving responses.  The exact method names might differ slightly across languages, but the functionality remains consistent.

* **`submitRequest(request)` or equivalent:** This is the primary method for submitting a request to the Boomerang system.  The `request` parameter is an object containing the task details (task name, data, and any necessary parameters). The method returns a handle (e.g., a future object, promise, or similar construct depending on the language) that can be used to retrieve the response asynchronously.

* **`submitBatch(requests)` or equivalent:** (If supported by the language binding) This method allows submitting multiple requests in a single batch, potentially improving efficiency by reducing overhead. The method returns a collection of handles, one for each request in the batch.


### Response Handling

Handling responses involves retrieving results from submitted requests and managing potential errors.  Methods will vary by language but aim for similar functionality.

* **`get/awaitResponse(handle)` or equivalent:**  This method retrieves the response associated with a given handle (returned by `submitRequest`). This method might block until the response is available, or might throw an exception if the request fails.

* **`getResponseStatus(handle)` or equivalent:**  This method allows checking the status of a request without blocking.  It returns a status code indicating the request's completion status (e.g., success, failure, in progress).

* **`handleExceptions(handle)` or equivalent:**  This method, or a similar error handling mechanism, is used to retrieve error information if the request failed.  This could involve accessing exception details or error messages.


### Utility Functions

Boomerang provides several utility functions to simplify common tasks:

* **`createRequest(taskName, data)` or equivalent:** A helper function for creating request objects. This simplifies the process of constructing requests, particularly for common tasks.

* **`shutdown()` or equivalent:**  This function gracefully shuts down the Boomerang client and releases resources.  This is crucial for preventing resource leaks and ensuring proper program termination.

* **`getStatistics()` or equivalent:**  (If supported) This function returns performance statistics, such as the number of processed requests, average processing time, and queue lengths.


### Events

(If supported by the implementation)  Boomerang might provide event mechanisms to allow asynchronous notification of important events:

* **`onTaskComplete` or equivalent:**  An event triggered when a task is successfully completed.  Event handlers can be registered to receive notifications of successful task completion.

* **`onTaskError` or equivalent:** An event triggered when a task encounters an error. Event handlers can be registered to react to task errors, potentially triggering recovery mechanisms.

* **`onQueueFull` or equivalent:** (If applicable) An event triggered when the request queue reaches its maximum capacity.


### Configuration Options

Boomerang's behavior can be customized via configuration options. These options can be set programmatically or through configuration files (depending on the language binding).

* **`workerPoolSize`:** The number of worker threads to use for processing requests.

* **`queueSize`:**  The maximum number of requests that can be queued before requests are rejected.

* **`logLevel`:** The logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

* **`retryPolicy`:**  (If supported) Defines the retry policy for failed requests.

Specific configuration options and their default values are detailed in the language-specific sections of this manual.  Consult those sections for details on how to set these options and their effects on Boomerang's performance and behavior.


## Examples and Use Cases

This section presents examples and use cases to illustrate Boomerang's capabilities in different contexts.  Remember to replace placeholder code with actual implementations for your chosen language.


### Simple HTTP Requests

A common use case is making asynchronous HTTP requests.  This example demonstrates fetching data from a URL:


```java
//Conceptual Java Example
BoomerangClient client = new BoomerangClient();
Request request = new Request("httpGet", "https://www.example.com");
Response response = client.submitRequest(request);
String data = response.getData(); //Process the response data (assuming it's a String)
```

```python
#Conceptual Python Example
import requests # Assuming requests library is used for handling HTTP response.  Adapt to Boomerang's HTTP handling if different.
client = BoomerangClient()
request = Request("httpGet", url="https://www.example.com")
response = client.submit(request)
data = response['data'] #Process the response data (assuming it's a string)
```

This simplifies asynchronous HTTP calls, allowing other operations to proceed while waiting for the response. Error handling (e.g., handling network issues or non-200 status codes) should be added for a robust solution.


### Complex API Interactions

Boomerang can handle complex API interactions involving multiple requests and dependencies:

**(Conceptual Example)**  Imagine an e-commerce application needing to check inventory, process payments, and update order status.  This could involve multiple API calls to different microservices. Boomerang allows these calls to be made concurrently, improving overall response time.  The workflow could be orchestrated using callbacks or futures, ensuring proper sequencing and handling of potential errors. A detailed implementation would require specific API details and error handling logic.
