It allows you to easily create responsive and visually appealing slideshows using minimal code.  Designed for simplicity and ease of use, SlidesJS is ideal for quickly integrating slideshow functionality into your web projects without the overhead of large, complex frameworks.  It focuses on providing a clean and efficient way to manage image or content-based slideshows, with options for customization and control.\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Lightweight and Dependency-Free:**  SlidesJS is small in file size and requires no external libraries or frameworks, making it easy to integrate into any project.\n* **Responsive Design:**  SlidesJS automatically adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring your slideshow looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.\n* **Ease of Use:**  The library is designed with a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to set up and customize.\n* **Customizable:**  Offers various options to control the slideshow's appearance and behavior, such as animation speed, transition effects, and auto-play functionality.\n* **Navigation Control:**  Provides built-in navigation controls (e.g., previous/next buttons, pagination) for easy user interaction.\n* **Cross-browser Compatibility:**  Works consistently across modern web browsers.\n* **SEO Friendly:** SlidesJS doesn't interfere with SEO best practices. The content remains accessible and crawlable.\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nSlidesJS is designed to work across a wide range of modern web browsers.  It has been tested and confirmed to function correctly on:\n\n* Google Chrome (latest versions)\n* Mozilla Firefox (latest versions)\n* Safari (latest versions)\n* Microsoft Edge (latest versions)\n* Internet Explorer (limited support, may require adjustments for older versions)\n\n\n### Getting Started: Installation and Setup\n\n1. **Download:** Download the `slides.js` file from [link to download - replace this with actual download link].\n\n2. **Include in your HTML:**  Add the following lines within the `<head>` section of your HTML document:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"slides.css\">  <!-- Include CSS file -->\n<script src=\"slides.js\"></script> <!-- Include JavaScript file -->\n```\nReplace `\"slides.css\"` and `\"slides.js\"` with the actual paths to your downloaded files.\n\n3. **Create your slideshow HTML:**  Create an unordered list (`<ul>`) element with list items (`<li>`) containing the content (images or text) for your slideshow.  Each `<li>` represents a slide.  For example:\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"slides\">\n  <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\"></li>\n  <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 2\"></li>\n  <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 3\"></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n4. **Initialize SlidesJS:**  Add the following JavaScript code after including the `slides.js` file.  This initializes the slideshow:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function(){\n  $('.slides').slidesjs({\n    // Optional settings here (see documentation for options)\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis code uses jQuery.  Ensure you have jQuery included in your project before using this initialization method.  Alternatively, refer to the SlidesJS documentation for methods of initialization without jQuery.\n\n5. **Customize (Optional):**  Explore the available options in the SlidesJS documentation to customize the slideshow's behavior, animation effects, and appearance.  These options are passed as parameters within the `slidesjs()` function call.\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Creating a SlidesJS Presentation\n\nTo create a SlidesJS presentation, you'll need to structure your HTML correctly.  The core element is an unordered list (`<ul>`) with the class `slides`. Each list item (`<li>`) within this `<ul>` represents a single slide in your presentation.  The content of each `<li>` can be an image, text, or any other HTML element you want to display.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"slides\">\n  <li>\n    <img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\">\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h2>Slide 2 Title</h2>\n    <p>This is the content of slide 2.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>This is slide 3 with just text.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nRemember to include the SlidesJS JavaScript and CSS files as described in the \"Getting Started\" section.  After including the necessary files and creating the HTML structure, SlidesJS will automatically generate the navigation and apply the default styling.\n\n\n### Adding Slides\n\nAdding new slides is as simple as adding more `<li>` elements to the `<ul class=\"slides\">`.  Each new `<li>` will become a new slide in your presentation.  Ensure that each slide has appropriate content.  For example, to add a fourth slide:\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"slides\">\n  <li>...</li>  <!-- Existing slides -->\n  <li>\n    <h3>Slide 4</h3>\n    <p>Content for slide 4.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n\n### Basic Navigation\n\nSlidesJS provides basic navigation by default.  This includes:\n\n* **Next/Previous Buttons:** Automatically generated buttons allow users to navigate through the slides sequentially.\n* **Pagination:**  Small dots (or numbers) appear below the slideshow, allowing users to jump directly to a specific slide.\n\nUsers can click the next/previous buttons or the pagination dots to navigate between slides.  No additional code is required for this basic navigation functionality.\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nSlidesJS offers several configuration options to customize the slideshow's behavior and appearance. These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `slidesjs()` function during initialization.\n\nSome common options include:\n\n* `width`:  Sets the width of the slideshow.\n* `height`: Sets the height of the slideshow.\n* `navigation`: Enables or disables the navigation controls (true/false).\n* `pagination`: Enables or disables the pagination (true/false).\n* `autoHeight`: Automatically adjusts the height of the slideshow based on the content of each slide.\n* `play`: Enables autoplay and sets the interval (in milliseconds).\n* `speed`: Sets the animation speed (in milliseconds).\n* `effect`: Specifies the transition effect (e.g., 'fade', 'slide').\n\nRefer to the comprehensive list of options provided in the full documentation. For example:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function(){\n  $('.slides').slidesjs({\n    width: 960,\n    height: 540,\n    navigation: {\n      next: {\n          key: 'right',\n          button: true\n      },\n      previous: {\n          key: 'left',\n          button: true\n      }\n    },\n    autoplay: {\n        pauseOnHover: true,\n        interval: 3000\n      }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\n### Default Styles and Customization\n\nSlidesJS includes default CSS styles that provide a basic, clean look.  These styles can be overridden or extended using your own CSS rules. To customize the appearance, create a custom CSS file and include it in your HTML.  You can target elements with classes like `.slides`, `.slides-container`, `.slides-navigation`, etc., to modify colors, fonts, spacing, and more.  Remember to place your custom CSS after the inclusion of the SlidesJS CSS to ensure your rules take precedence.  Inspect the generated HTML to identify specific classes you can target for more precise customizations.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Transitions\n\nBeyond the basic transition effects provided (like `fade` and `slide`), SlidesJS allows for more extensive customization. While direct manipulation of the transition itself isn't directly exposed through settings, you can achieve sophisticated transitions by manipulating the CSS classes applied to the slides during the transition. By understanding how SlidesJS manages these classes (check the generated HTML during transitions), you can create custom CSS animations that are triggered by these class changes. This involves creating keyframes or using CSS transitions to animate properties like `opacity`, `transform`, etc.  This requires a good understanding of CSS animations and transitions.\n\n\n### Adding Navigation Controls\n\nWhile SlidesJS provides default navigation, you might want to integrate custom controls.  This is achieved by using the SlidesJS API (described below). You can add custom buttons (e.g., using images or different styling) and bind them to the `slidesjs` methods like `next()` and `previous()`. This allows for creative placement and styling of navigation elements.  Remember to use appropriate selectors for your custom buttons in your event handlers.\n\n\n### Autoplay Functionality\n\nSlidesJS offers autoplay capabilities via configuration options.  You can enable autoplay and set the interval between slides using the `autoplay` option. You can also fine-tune the autoplay behavior, such as pausing on hover using the `pauseOnHover` setting within the `autoplay` object.  For more advanced control, you can directly use the API methods to start, stop, and control the autoplay manually from your own code.\n\n\n### Using the SlidesJS API\n\nSlidesJS exposes a public API to control the slideshow programmatically.  This API allows for advanced interactions, such as:\n\n* `next()`:  Advances the slideshow to the next slide.\n* `previous()`:  Goes back to the previous slide.\n* `goto(index)`:  Jumps directly to a specific slide (index starts from 0).\n* `play()`: Starts autoplay.\n* `stop()`: Stops autoplay.\n* `destroy()`:  Completely removes SlidesJS functionality from the slideshow.\n\nThese methods are called on the jQuery object representing the slideshow container (e.g., `$('.slides').slidesjs('next');`). Consult the full documentation for a complete list of API methods and their usage.\n\n\n### Handling Events\n\nSlidesJS triggers several events throughout its lifecycle.  These events allow you to execute custom code at specific points, such as when a slide changes or autoplay starts/stops.  You can use the jQuery `on()` method to listen for these events.  Some common events include:\n\n* `slidesjs.beforechange`: Fired just before a slide transition begins.\n* `slidesjs.afterchange`: Fired after a slide transition completes.\n* `slidesjs.start`: Fired when the autoplay starts.\n* `slidesjs.stop`: Fired when the autoplay stops.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n$('.slides').on('slidesjs.afterchange', function(event, data) {\n  console.log('Slide changed to:', data.current); // Access current slide index\n});\n```\n\n\n### Integration with other JavaScript libraries\n\nSlidesJS is designed to work well with other JavaScript libraries.  The most common integration is with jQuery, as shown in the examples above.  However, you can adapt the initialization and API calls to work with other frameworks or libraries if needed,  provided they allow for DOM manipulation and event handling.  Remember to manage potential conflicts between different libraries by ensuring proper loading order and namespace management.  If not using jQuery, refer to the SlidesJS documentation for non-jQuery initialization methods.\n\n\n## Responsive Design and Mobile Support\n\n### Adapting SlidesJS to different screen sizes\n\nSlidesJS is inherently responsive. It automatically adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions without requiring any special configuration.  The slideshow will adjust its dimensions to fit within its container, ensuring the content remains visible and appropriately sized across various devices.  However, you might want to fine-tune the behavior with CSS media queries to make sure the slideshow looks its best at different viewports.  For example, you can adjust margins, padding, font sizes, and image sizes using media queries to provide a tailored experience for mobile and desktop devices.  Remember to consider both the slideshow's container and the content within the slides when crafting your media queries.\n\n\n### Touch gestures\n\nSlidesJS automatically supports touch gestures on mobile devices.  Users can swipe left and right to navigate through the slides. This functionality is built-in and doesn't require any extra configuration or code.  The default behavior is designed for intuitive swiping navigation, so you typically won’t need to make changes for smooth touch interaction.\n\n\n### Optimizing for mobile devices\n\nWhile SlidesJS is already responsive, several optimization techniques can further improve its performance and user experience on mobile devices:\n\n* **Image Optimization:** Use appropriately sized and compressed images.  Large images can significantly impact loading times on mobile devices. Consider using responsive images (`<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute) to serve different image sizes based on screen resolution.\n* **Minimize JavaScript and CSS:** Although SlidesJS is already lightweight, keep your additional JavaScript and CSS code concise to prevent performance bottlenecks.  Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations within your custom event handlers.\n* **Lazy Loading:** If you have a large number of images, consider implementing lazy loading. This technique delays the loading of images until they are about to be displayed, improving initial page load speed.\n* **Test on real devices:**  Always test your slideshow on actual mobile devices to identify and address any performance issues or layout problems that might not be apparent during desktop testing.  Different browsers and devices may render the slideshow slightly differently.\n* **Consider alternative libraries for complex animations:** If you have very complex animations within your slides, consider whether SlidesJS is the best choice.  Very demanding animations can affect the responsiveness of the slideshow, especially on low-powered devices. A simpler approach might improve performance.\n\nBy following these optimizations, you can ensure your SlidesJS slideshow provides a fast and enjoyable experience on all devices.\n\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\n\nSlidesJS provides built-in keyboard navigation. Users can navigate through the slideshow using the left and right arrow keys. This allows users who cannot use a mouse or touchscreen to easily interact with the slideshow.  The default keyboard navigation is automatically provided; no additional code is required to enable it.\n\n\n### Screen Reader Compatibility\n\nSlidesJS aims to be compatible with screen readers. The slideshow's structure uses semantic HTML (primarily `<ul>` and `<li>` elements) which allows screen readers to interpret the content effectively.  However, to maximize screen reader compatibility, consider the following:\n\n* **Descriptive ALT text:**  Provide meaningful `alt` attributes for all images within your slides. This ensures screen reader users understand the visual content.\n* **Clear headings:** Use appropriate heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure the content of each slide logically. This helps screen readers convey the hierarchical structure of the information.\n* **Semantic HTML:**  Use semantic HTML elements where possible to convey meaning and context to screen readers.\n* **Avoid relying solely on visual cues:**  Ensure that important information isn't solely conveyed through visual elements (like color or size) as screen readers won't interpret these.  Instead, use text labels or alternative mechanisms to convey information.\n\n\n### ARIA Attributes\n\nWhile SlidesJS doesn't automatically add all ARIA attributes, you can enhance accessibility by manually adding some relevant ARIA attributes to your HTML. This can improve the experience for screen reader users and assistive technology.  Consider adding these attributes where appropriate:\n\n* `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`:  Provide descriptive labels for buttons and other interactive elements.\n* `aria-current`: Indicate the currently active slide to screen readers.  You can dynamically add this attribute using JavaScript and the SlidesJS API events (`slidesjs.beforechange` and `slidesjs.afterchange`) to update the `aria-current` attribute on the active slide.\n* `role=\"presentation\"`: For elements that are purely presentational and don't convey meaningful information to screen readers, consider adding `role=\"presentation\"` to prevent them from being announced.  This might be applicable to certain wrapper elements within your slides.\n\n\nRemember, thorough testing with different screen readers is crucial to ensure your slideshow meets accessibility standards.  The effectiveness of ARIA attributes and other accessibility techniques might vary depending on the specific screen reader and its configuration.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Slideshow not appearing:** Double-check that you've correctly included the SlidesJS CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML.  Ensure the paths to these files are accurate and that there are no typos in the `<link>` and `<script>` tags.  Verify that the `<ul>` element containing your slides has the class `slides`.  Inspect your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Slides not transitioning:** Check your configuration options (especially `speed` and `effect`).  A very low `speed` value might make transitions appear instantaneous and thus unnoticeable. Ensure the `navigation` and `pagination` options are enabled if you expect those controls to work.  If using custom transitions, double-check your CSS animations and ensure they are correctly triggered by the relevant SlidesJS CSS classes.\n\n* **Autoplay not working:** Verify that the `autoplay` option is set to `true` in your configuration.  If using `pauseOnHover`, ensure that the mouse hover event is working correctly (sometimes issues arise with specific themes or JavaScript interfering with default hover behavior). Check the `interval` setting to make sure it's a reasonable value.\n\n* **Layout issues:**  Inspect your HTML and CSS.  Ensure that your container element has appropriate width and height values.  If using media queries, make sure they are correctly applied based on screen size.  Incorrect CSS styling or conflicting styles can cause layout problems.  Consider using your browser's developer tools to inspect the rendered HTML and CSS for unexpected values or styles.\n\n* **JavaScript errors in the console:** The browser's developer console (usually opened by pressing F12) will show any JavaScript errors.  Carefully examine these error messages to pinpoint the cause. Common problems include incorrect variable names, missing libraries (if using jQuery), or conflicts with other JavaScript code on your page.\n\n* **Slideshow not responsive:** Ensure that the container element holding your slideshow is appropriately set up for responsive design.  The SlidesJS library itself is responsive, but the overall layout must also be responsive to handle different screen sizes effectively.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML and CSS, check the JavaScript console for errors, and debug your code step-by-step.  The network tab can help you see if resources are loading correctly and efficiently.\n\n* **Simplify your code:** If you're having trouble with custom transitions, navigation controls, or event handlers, try simplifying your code to isolate the problem.  Remove or comment out parts of your code to see if the issue persists.  Start by testing the basic functionality of SlidesJS before adding your custom elements.\n\n* **Console logging:** Use `console.log()` statements to print the values of variables or the status of certain conditions throughout your code.  This can help you track the flow of execution and identify potential issues.\n\n* **Check for jQuery Conflicts:** If you’re using jQuery, make sure you're only including one version and that there are no conflicts with other jQuery plugins or libraries.\n\n* **Test in different browsers:** Test your slideshow in multiple browsers to identify any browser-specific problems.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Browser-Specific Problems\n\nBrowser-specific problems are less common with SlidesJS due to its lightweight nature and reliance on standard web technologies.  However, if you encounter issues, the following steps may help:\n\n* **Check for browser compatibility:**  While SlidesJS aims for broad compatibility, ensure the browser you're using is supported.  Very old browsers might require polyfills for certain features.\n\n* **Update your browser:** An outdated browser might lack support for necessary CSS or JavaScript features.  Update your browser to the latest version.\n\n* **Disable browser extensions:** Some browser extensions can interfere with the functioning of JavaScript code. Try temporarily disabling extensions to see if that resolves the problem.\n\n* **Clear browser cache and cookies:**  A corrupted cache can occasionally cause problems.  Clearing the cache and cookies can resolve these issues.\n\nIf you continue to experience browser-specific issues, provide detailed information (including the browser version, operating system, and specific error messages) when seeking support.  Include examples of your code and the steps to reproduce the problem.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the SlidesJS API, including methods, events, and configuration options.  Remember that the API methods are typically called using jQuery, unless specified otherwise (see the non-jQuery initialization in the main documentation).  For example, `$('.slides').slidesjs('method')` calls the `method` on the SlidesJS instance associated with the element with the class `slides`.\n\n### SlidesJS Methods\n\n* **`next()`:**  Advances the slideshow to the next slide.\n* **`previous()`:** Moves the slideshow to the previous slide.\n* **`goto(index)`:**  Jumps to a specific slide. `index` is a zero-based index (0 for the first slide, 1 for the second, etc.).\n* **`play()`:** Starts the autoplay functionality if it's enabled.\n* **`stop()`:** Stops the autoplay functionality.\n* **`destroy()`:**  Completely removes SlidesJS functionality from the slideshow element.  The slideshow will revert to its original HTML structure.  This is useful for dynamically removing or replacing a slideshow.\n* **`getCurrent()`:** Returns the index of the currently displayed slide (zero-based index).\n* **`getSlidesCount()`:** Returns the total number of slides in the slideshow.\n\n\n### SlidesJS Events\n\nSlidesJS triggers several custom events that can be used to integrate custom functionality with the slideshow. These events are triggered on the slideshow's container element. You can listen for these events using jQuery's `.on()` method (or the equivalent in your chosen JavaScript framework).\n\n* **`slidesjs.init`:** Fired when the SlidesJS plugin has finished initializing.\n* **`slidesjs.beforechange`:** Fired immediately before a slide transition begins. The event object contains a `data` property with information about the transition:\n    * `data.prev`: index of the previous slide\n    * `data.current`: index of the current slide\n    * `data.next`: index of the next slide\n* **`slidesjs.afterchange`:** Fired after a slide transition is complete.  The event object's `data` property is structured the same as `slidesjs.beforechange`.\n* **`slidesjs.start`:** Fired when the autoplay functionality starts.\n* **`slidesjs.stop`:** Fired when the autoplay functionality stops.\n\n\n**Example using `slidesjs.afterchange`:**\n\n```javascript\n$('.slides').on('slidesjs.afterchange', function(event, data) {\n  console.log('Current slide:', data.current);\n  // Add your custom code here based on the current slide index.\n});\n```\n\n\n### SlidesJS Configuration Options\n\nSlidesJS offers a range of configuration options that can be passed as a JavaScript object to the `slidesjs()` function during initialization.  Here are some key options:\n\n* **`width`:** (Integer) Width of the slideshow container.\n* **`height`:** (Integer) Height of the slideshow container.\n* **`start`:** (Integer, default: 0) Index of the starting slide (zero-based).\n* **`navigation`:** (Boolean or Object, default: `true`) Enables/disables navigation controls.  Can be an object for more granular control over next/prev buttons.\n    *  `next` (Object):  Options for the \"next\" navigation (e.g., `{button: true, key: 'right'}`)\n    * `previous` (Object): Options for the \"previous\" navigation (e.g., `{button: true, key: 'left'}`)\n* **`pagination`:** (Boolean, default: `true`) Enables/disables pagination.\n* **`autoHeight`:** (Boolean, default: `false`) Automatically adjusts the height of the slideshow based on slide content.\n* **`play`:** (Object, default: `false`) Enables/configures autoplay.\n    * `active`: Boolean, defaults to false\n    * `interval`: Integer (milliseconds), time between transitions\n    * `pauseOnHover`: Boolean, defaults to true\n* **`speed`:** (Integer, default: 500) Transition speed in milliseconds.\n* **`effect`:** (String, default: `slide`) Transition effect ('slide', 'fade').  Note that advanced custom transitions are achieved through CSS, not directly through this option.\n\n\n**Example using configuration options:**\n\n```javascript\n$('.slides').slidesjs({\n  width: 800,\n  height: 400,\n  navigation: { next: { button: false }, previous: { button: true } },\n  autoplay: { active: true, interval: 4000, pauseOnHover: true },\n  effect: 'fade'\n});\n```\n\nRefer to the full documentation for a comprehensive list of all configuration options and their descriptions.  Remember that available options and their defaults might change in newer versions of SlidesJS, so always refer to the latest documentation.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section provides examples and use cases to illustrate how to use SlidesJS effectively.\n\n### Simple Presentation Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic image slideshow with minimal configuration.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>SlidesJS Simple Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"slides.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n<ul class=\"slides\">\n  <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></li>\n  <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></li>\n  <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></li>\n</ul>\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Include jQuery -->\n<script src=\"slides.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(function() {\n    $('.slides').slidesjs();\n  });\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.  This example uses the default settings of SlidesJS.  The inclusion of jQuery is shown here; ensure you include it if using the jQuery-based initialization method.\n\n### Advanced Presentation Example\n\nThis example shows a more complex slideshow with custom navigation, autoplay, and a fade transition.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>SlidesJS Advanced Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"slides.css\">\n  <style>\n    .custom-nav { margin-top: 20px; }\n    .custom-nav button { padding: 10px; margin: 0 5px; }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><h1>Slide 1</h1><p>Content for slide 1</p></li>\n    <li><h1>Slide 2</h1><p>Content for slide 2</p></li>\n    <li><h1>Slide 3</h1><p>Content for slide 3</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  <div class=\"custom-nav\">\n    <button id=\"prev\">Previous</button>\n    <button id=\"next\">Next</button>\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"slides.js\"></script>\n  <script>\n    $(function() {\n      $('.slides').slidesjs({\n        effect: 'fade',\n        autoplay: { active: true, interval: 3000 },\n        navigation: { next: {button: false}, previous: {button: false} } //Disable default nav\n      });\n      $('#next').click(function() { $('.slides').slidesjs('next'); });\n      $('#prev').click(function() { $('.slides').slidesjs('previous'); });\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis example adds custom \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons and disables the default navigation. It also uses a fade transition and autoplay.\n\n\n### Integration with other frameworks\n\nSlidesJS can be integrated with various JavaScript frameworks.  The examples above already showcase integration with jQuery. For other frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular), you would typically include SlidesJS as part of your component and use its API methods within the framework's lifecycle methods. The integration will heavily depend on how your framework manages DOM elements and event handling.  You'd handle the initialization and API calls within your component's logic.  Refer to the specific documentation of your framework for more guidance.\n\n\n### Real-world Use Cases\n\n* **Product Showcases:** Displaying a series of product images or videos.\n* **Image Galleries:** Creating interactive image galleries with navigation.\n* **Website Intros:**  Creating an engaging introduction to a website using a slideshow.\n* **Tutorials and Guides:** Presenting step-by-step instructions or walkthroughs.\n* **Presentations:**  Delivering presentations online using slides with text and images.\n* **News Rotators:** Displaying recent news items or announcements.\n* **Testimonials:**  Showcasing client testimonials with images or videos.\n\nThe versatility of SlidesJS allows for various applications where a visually appealing and interactive slideshow is beneficial.  Remember to tailor your implementation to your specific requirements and the overall design of your website or application.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Introduction\n\n### What is SlidesJS?\n\nSlidesJS is a lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript slideshow library.

Ensure you have jQuery included in your project before using this initialization method.  Alternatively, refer to the SlidesJS documentation for methods of initialization without jQuery.\n\n5. **Customize (Optional):**  Explore the available options in the SlidesJS documentation to customize the slideshow's behavior, animation effects, and appearance.  These options are passed as parameters within the `slidesjs()` function call.\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Creating a SlidesJS Presentation\n\nTo create a SlidesJS presentation, you'll need to structure your HTML correctly.  The core element is an unordered list (`<ul>`) with the class `slides`. Each list item (`<li>`) within this `<ul>` represents a single slide in your presentation.  The content of each `<li>` can be an image, text, or any other HTML element you want to display.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"slides\">\n  <li>\n    <img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\">\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <h2>Slide 2 Title</h2>\n    <p>This is the content of slide 2.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>This is slide 3 with just text.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nRemember to include the SlidesJS JavaScript and CSS files as described in the \"Getting Started\" section.  After including the necessary files and creating the HTML structure, SlidesJS will automatically generate the navigation and apply the default styling.\n\n\n### Adding Slides\n\nAdding new slides is as simple as adding more `<li>` elements to the `<ul class=\"slides\">`.  Each new `<li>` will become a new slide in your presentation.  Ensure that each slide has appropriate content.  For example, to add a fourth slide:\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"slides\">\n  <li>...</li>  <!-- Existing slides -->\n  <li>\n    <h3>Slide 4</h3>\n    <p>Content for slide 4.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n\n### Basic Navigation\n\nSlidesJS provides basic navigation by default.  This includes:\n\n* **Next/Previous Buttons:** Automatically generated buttons allow users to navigate through the slides sequentially.\n* **Pagination:**  Small dots (or numbers) appear below the slideshow, allowing users to jump directly to a specific slide.\n\nUsers can click the next/previous buttons or the pagination dots to navigate between slides.  No additional code is required for this basic navigation functionality.\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nSlidesJS offers several configuration options to customize the slideshow's behavior and appearance. These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `slidesjs()` function during initialization.\n\nSome common options include:\n\n* `width`:  Sets the width of the slideshow.\n* `height`: Sets the height of the slideshow.\n* `navigation`: Enables or disables the navigation controls (true/false).\n* `pagination`: Enables or disables the pagination (true/false).\n* `autoHeight`: Automatically adjusts the height of the slideshow based on the content of each slide.\n* `play`: Enables autoplay and sets the interval (in milliseconds).\n* `speed`: Sets the animation speed (in milliseconds).\n* `effect`: Specifies the transition effect (e.g., 'fade', 'slide').\n\nRefer to the comprehensive list of options provided in the full documentation. For example:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function(){\n  $('.slides').slidesjs({\n    width: 960,\n    height: 540,\n    navigation: {\n      next: {\n          key: 'right',\n          button: true\n      },\n      previous: {\n          key: 'left',\n          button: true\n      }\n    },\n    autoplay: {\n        pauseOnHover: true,\n        interval: 3000\n      }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\n### Default Styles and Customization\n\nSlidesJS includes default CSS styles that provide a basic, clean look.  These styles can be overridden or extended using your own CSS rules. To customize the appearance, create a custom CSS file and include it in your HTML.  You can target elements with classes like `.slides`, `.slides-container`, `.slides-navigation`, etc., to modify colors, fonts, spacing, and more.  Remember to place your custom CSS after the inclusion of the SlidesJS CSS to ensure your rules take precedence.  Inspect the generated HTML to identify specific classes you can target for more precise customizations.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Transitions\n\nBeyond the basic transition effects provided (like `fade` and `slide`), SlidesJS allows for more extensive customization. While direct manipulation of the transition itself isn't directly exposed through settings, you can achieve sophisticated transitions by manipulating the CSS classes applied to the slides during the transition. By understanding how SlidesJS manages these classes (check the generated HTML during transitions), you can create custom CSS animations that are triggered by these class changes. This involves creating keyframes or using CSS transitions to animate properties like `opacity`, `transform`, etc.  This requires a good understanding of CSS animations and transitions.\n\n\n### Adding Navigation Controls\n\nWhile SlidesJS provides default navigation, you might want to integrate custom controls.  This is achieved by using the SlidesJS API (described below). You can add custom buttons (e.g., using images or different styling) and bind them to the `slidesjs` methods like `next()` and `previous()`. This allows for creative placement and styling of navigation elements.  Remember to use appropriate selectors for your custom buttons in your event handlers.\n\n\n### Autoplay Functionality\n\nSlidesJS offers autoplay capabilities via configuration options.  You can enable autoplay and set the interval between slides using the `autoplay` option. You can also fine-tune the autoplay behavior, such as pausing on hover using the `pauseOnHover` setting within the `autoplay` object.  For more advanced control, you can directly use the API methods to start, stop, and control the autoplay manually from your own code.\n\n\n### Using the SlidesJS API\n\nSlidesJS exposes a public API to control the slideshow programmatically.  This API allows for advanced interactions, such as:\n\n* `next()`:  Advances the slideshow to the next slide.\n* `previous()`:  Goes back to the previous slide.\n* `goto(index)`:  Jumps directly to a specific slide (index starts from 0).\n* `play()`: Starts autoplay.\n* `stop()`: Stops autoplay.\n* `destroy()`:  Completely removes SlidesJS functionality from the slideshow.\n\nThese methods are called on the jQuery object representing the slideshow container (e.g., `$('.slides').slidesjs('next');`). Consult the full documentation for a complete list of API methods and their usage.\n\n\n### Handling Events\n\nSlidesJS triggers several events throughout its lifecycle.  These events allow you to execute custom code at specific points, such as when a slide changes or autoplay starts/stops.  You can use the jQuery `on()` method to listen for these events.  Some common events include:\n\n* `slidesjs.beforechange`: Fired just before a slide transition begins.\n* `slidesjs.afterchange`: Fired after a slide transition completes.\n* `slidesjs.start`: Fired when the autoplay starts.\n* `slidesjs.stop`: Fired when the autoplay stops.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n$('.slides').on('slidesjs.afterchange', function(event, data) {\n  console.log('Slide changed to:', data.current); // Access current slide index\n});\n```\n\n\n### Integration with other JavaScript libraries\n\nSlidesJS is designed to work well with other JavaScript libraries.  The most common integration is with jQuery, as shown in the examples above.  However, you can adapt the initialization and API calls to work with other frameworks or libraries if needed,  provided they allow for DOM manipulation and event handling.  Remember to manage potential conflicts between different libraries by ensuring proper loading order and namespace management.  If not using jQuery, refer to the SlidesJS documentation for non-jQuery initialization methods.\n\n\n## Responsive Design and Mobile Support\n\n### Adapting SlidesJS to different screen sizes\n\nSlidesJS is inherently responsive. It automatically adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions without requiring any special configuration.  The slideshow will adjust its dimensions to fit within its container, ensuring the content remains visible and appropriately sized across various devices.  However, you might want to fine-tune the behavior with CSS media queries to make sure the slideshow looks its best at different viewports.  For example, you can adjust margins, padding, font sizes, and image sizes using media queries to provide a tailored experience for mobile and desktop devices.  Remember to consider both the slideshow's container and the content within the slides when crafting your media queries.\n\n\n### Touch gestures\n\nSlidesJS automatically supports touch gestures on mobile devices.  Users can swipe left and right to navigate through the slides. This functionality is built-in and doesn't require any extra configuration or code.  The default behavior is designed for intuitive swiping navigation, so you typically won’t need to make changes for smooth touch interaction.\n\n\n### Optimizing for mobile devices\n\nWhile SlidesJS is already responsive, several optimization techniques can further improve its performance and user experience on mobile devices:\n\n* **Image Optimization:** Use appropriately sized and compressed images.  Large images can significantly impact loading times on mobile devices. Consider using responsive images (`<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute) to serve different image sizes based on screen resolution.\n* **Minimize JavaScript and CSS:** Although SlidesJS is already lightweight, keep your additional JavaScript and CSS code concise to prevent performance bottlenecks.  Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations within your custom event handlers.\n* **Lazy Loading:** If you have a large number of images, consider implementing lazy loading. This technique delays the loading of images until they are about to be displayed, improving initial page load speed.\n* **Test on real devices:**  Always test your slideshow on actual mobile devices to identify and address any performance issues or layout problems that might not be apparent during desktop testing.  Different browsers and devices may render the slideshow slightly differently.\n* **Consider alternative libraries for complex animations:** If you have very complex animations within your slides, consider whether SlidesJS is the best choice.  Very demanding animations can affect the responsiveness of the slideshow, especially on low-powered devices. A simpler approach might improve performance.\n\nBy following these optimizations, you can ensure your SlidesJS slideshow provides a fast and enjoyable experience on all devices.\n\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\n\nSlidesJS provides built-in keyboard navigation. Users can navigate through the slideshow using the left and right arrow keys. This allows users who cannot use a mouse or touchscreen to easily interact with the slideshow.  The default keyboard navigation is automatically provided; no additional code is required to enable it.\n\n\n### Screen Reader Compatibility\n\nSlidesJS aims to be compatible with screen readers. The slideshow's structure uses semantic HTML (primarily `<ul>` and `<li>` elements) which allows screen readers to interpret the content effectively.  However, to maximize screen reader compatibility, consider the following:\n\n* **Descriptive ALT text:**  Provide meaningful `alt` attributes for all images within your slides. This ensures screen reader users understand the visual content.\n* **Clear headings:** Use appropriate heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure the content of each slide logically. This helps screen readers convey the hierarchical structure of the information.\n* **Semantic HTML:**  Use semantic HTML elements where possible to convey meaning and context to screen readers.\n* **Avoid relying solely on visual cues:**  Ensure that important information isn't solely conveyed through visual elements (like color or size) as screen readers won't interpret these.  Instead, use text labels or alternative mechanisms to convey information.\n\n\n### ARIA Attributes\n\nWhile SlidesJS doesn't automatically add all ARIA attributes, you can enhance accessibility by manually adding some relevant ARIA attributes to your HTML. This can improve the experience for screen reader users and assistive technology.  Consider adding these attributes where appropriate:\n\n* `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`:  Provide descriptive labels for buttons and other interactive elements.\n* `aria-current`: Indicate the currently active slide to screen readers.  You can dynamically add this attribute using JavaScript and the SlidesJS API events (`slidesjs.beforechange` and `slidesjs.afterchange`) to update the `aria-current` attribute on the active slide.\n* `role=\"presentation\"`: For elements that are purely presentational and don't convey meaningful information to screen readers, consider adding `role=\"presentation\"` to prevent them from being announced.  This might be applicable to certain wrapper elements within your slides.\n\n\nRemember, thorough testing with different screen readers is crucial to ensure your slideshow meets accessibility standards.  The effectiveness of ARIA attributes and other accessibility techniques might vary depending on the specific screen reader and its configuration.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Slideshow not appearing:** Double-check that you've correctly included the SlidesJS CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML.  Ensure the paths to these files are accurate and that there are no typos in the `<link>` and `<script>` tags.  Verify that the `<ul>` element containing your slides has the class `slides`.  Inspect your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Slides not transitioning:** Check your configuration options (especially `speed` and `effect`).  A very low `speed` value might make transitions appear instantaneous and thus unnoticeable. Ensure the `navigation` and `pagination` options are enabled if you expect those controls to work.  If using custom transitions, double-check your CSS animations and ensure they are correctly triggered by the relevant SlidesJS CSS classes.\n\n* **Autoplay not working:** Verify that the `autoplay` option is set to `true` in your configuration.  If using `pauseOnHover`, ensure that the mouse hover event is working correctly (sometimes issues arise with specific themes or JavaScript interfering with default hover behavior). Check the `interval` setting to make sure it's a reasonable value.\n\n* **Layout issues:**  Inspect your HTML and CSS.  Ensure that your container element has appropriate width and height values.  If using media queries, make sure they are correctly applied based on screen size.  Incorrect CSS styling or conflicting styles can cause layout problems.  Consider using your browser's developer tools to inspect the rendered HTML and CSS for unexpected values or styles.\n\n* **JavaScript errors in the console:** The browser's developer console (usually opened by pressing F12) will show any JavaScript errors.  Carefully examine these error messages to pinpoint the cause. Common problems include incorrect variable names, missing libraries (if using jQuery), or conflicts with other JavaScript code on your page.\n\n* **Slideshow not responsive:** Ensure that the container element holding your slideshow is appropriately set up for responsive design.  The SlidesJS library itself is responsive, but the overall layout must also be responsive to handle different screen sizes effectively.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML and CSS, check the JavaScript console for errors, and debug your code step-by-step.  The network tab can help you see if resources are loading correctly and efficiently.\n\n* **Simplify your code:** If you're having trouble with custom transitions, navigation controls, or event handlers, try simplifying your code to isolate the problem.  Remove or comment out parts of your code to see if the issue persists.  Start by testing the basic functionality of SlidesJS before adding your custom elements.\n\n* **Console logging:** Use `console.log()` statements to print the values of variables or the status of certain conditions throughout your code.  This can help you track the flow of execution and identify potential issues.\n\n* **Check for jQuery Conflicts:** If you’re using jQuery, make sure you're only including one version and that there are no conflicts with other jQuery plugins or libraries.\n\n* **Test in different browsers:** Test your slideshow in multiple browsers to identify any browser-specific problems.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Browser-Specific Problems\n\nBrowser-specific problems are less common with SlidesJS due to its lightweight nature and reliance on standard web technologies.  However, if you encounter issues, the following steps may help:\n\n* **Check for browser compatibility:**  While SlidesJS aims for broad compatibility, ensure the browser you're using is supported.  Very old browsers might require polyfills for certain features.\n\n* **Update your browser:** An outdated browser might lack support for necessary CSS or JavaScript features.  Update your browser to the latest version.\n\n* **Disable browser extensions:** Some browser extensions can interfere with the functioning of JavaScript code. Try temporarily disabling extensions to see if that resolves the problem.\n\n* **Clear browser cache and cookies:**  A corrupted cache can occasionally cause problems.  Clearing the cache and cookies can resolve these issues.\n\nIf you continue to experience browser-specific issues, provide detailed information (including the browser version, operating system, and specific error messages) when seeking support.  Include examples of your code and the steps to reproduce the problem.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the SlidesJS API, including methods, events, and configuration options.  Remember that the API methods are typically called using jQuery, unless specified otherwise (see the non-jQuery initialization in the main documentation).  For example, `$('.slides').slidesjs('method')` calls the `method` on the SlidesJS instance associated with the element with the class `slides`.\n\n### SlidesJS Methods\n\n* **`next()`:**  Advances the slideshow to the next slide.\n* **`previous()`:** Moves the slideshow to the previous slide.\n* **`goto(index)`:**  Jumps to a specific slide. `index` is a zero-based index (0 for the first slide, 1 for the second, etc.).\n* **`play()`:** Starts the autoplay functionality if it's enabled.\n* **`stop()`:** Stops the autoplay functionality.\n* **`destroy()`:**  Completely removes SlidesJS functionality from the slideshow element.  The slideshow will revert to its original HTML structure.  This is useful for dynamically removing or replacing a slideshow.\n* **`getCurrent()`:** Returns the index of the currently displayed slide (zero-based index).\n* **`getSlidesCount()`:** Returns the total number of slides in the slideshow.\n\n\n### SlidesJS Events\n\nSlidesJS triggers several custom events that can be used to integrate custom functionality with the slideshow. These events are triggered on the slideshow's container element. You can listen for these events using jQuery's `.on()` method (or the equivalent in your chosen JavaScript framework).\n\n* **`slidesjs.init`:** Fired when the SlidesJS plugin has finished initializing.\n* **`slidesjs.beforechange`:** Fired immediately before a slide transition begins. The event object contains a `data` property with information about the transition:\n    * `data.prev`: index of the previous slide\n    * `data.current`: index of the current slide\n    * `data.next`: index of the next slide\n* **`slidesjs.afterchange`:** Fired after a slide transition is complete.  The event object's `data` property is structured the same as `slidesjs.beforechange`.\n* **`slidesjs.start`:** Fired when the autoplay functionality starts.\n* **`slidesjs.stop`:** Fired when the autoplay functionality stops.\n\n\n**Example using `slidesjs.afterchange`:**\n\n```javascript\n$('.slides').on('slidesjs.afterchange', function(event, data) {\n  console.log('Current slide:', data.current);\n  // Add your custom code here based on the current slide index.\n});\n```\n\n\n### SlidesJS Configuration Options\n\nSlidesJS offers a range of configuration options that can be passed as a JavaScript object to the `slidesjs()` function during initialization.  Here are some key options:\n\n* **`width`:** (Integer) Width of the slideshow container.\n* **`height`:** (Integer) Height of the slideshow container.\n* **`start`:** (Integer, default: 0) Index of the starting slide (zero-based).\n* **`navigation`:** (Boolean or Object, default: `true`) Enables/disables navigation controls.  Can be an object for more granular control over next/prev buttons.\n    *  `next` (Object):  Options for the \"next\" navigation (e.g., `{button: true, key: 'right'}`)\n    * `previous` (Object): Options for the \"previous\" navigation (e.g., `{button: true, key: 'left'}`)\n* **`pagination`:** (Boolean, default: `true`) Enables/disables pagination.\n* **`autoHeight`:** (Boolean, default: `false`) Automatically adjusts the height of the slideshow based on slide content.\n* **`play`:** (Object, default: `false`) Enables/configures autoplay.\n    * `active`: Boolean, defaults to false\n    * `interval`: Integer (milliseconds), time between transitions\n    * `pauseOnHover`: Boolean, defaults to true\n* **`speed`:** (Integer, default: 500) Transition speed in milliseconds.\n* **`effect`:** (String, default: `slide`) Transition effect ('slide', 'fade').  Note that advanced custom transitions are achieved through CSS, not directly through this option.\n\n\n**Example using configuration options:**\n\n```javascript\n$('.slides').slidesjs({\n  width: 800,\n  height: 400,\n  navigation: { next: { button: false }, previous: { button: true } },\n  autoplay: { active: true, interval: 4000, pauseOnHover: true },\n  effect: 'fade'\n});\n```\n\nRefer to the full documentation for a comprehensive list of all configuration options and their descriptions.  Remember that available options and their defaults might change in newer versions of SlidesJS, so always refer to the latest documentation.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section provides examples and use cases to illustrate how to use SlidesJS effectively.\n\n### Simple Presentation Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic image slideshow with minimal configuration.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>SlidesJS Simple Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"slides.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n<ul class=\"slides\">\n  <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></li>\n  <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></li>\n  <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></li>\n</ul>\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Include jQuery -->\n<script src=\"slides.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(function() {\n    $('.slides').slidesjs();\n  });\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.  This example uses the default settings of SlidesJS.  The inclusion of jQuery is shown here; ensure you include it if using the jQuery-based initialization method.\n\n### Advanced Presentation Example\n\nThis example shows a more complex slideshow with custom navigation, autoplay, and a fade transition.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>SlidesJS Advanced Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"slides.css\">\n  <style>\n    .custom-nav { margin-top: 20px; }\n    .custom-nav button { padding: 10px; margin: 0 5px; }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><h1>Slide 1</h1><p>Content for slide 1</p></li>\n    <li><h1>Slide 2</h1><p>Content for slide 2</p></li>\n    <li><h1>Slide 3</h1><p>Content for slide 3</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  <div class=\"custom-nav\">\n    <button id=\"prev\">Previous</button>\n    <button id=\"next\">Next</button>\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"slides.js\"></script>\n  <script>\n    $(function() {\n      $('.slides').slidesjs({\n        effect: 'fade',\n        autoplay: { active: true, interval: 3000 },\n        navigation: { next: {button: false}, previous: {button: false} } //Disable default nav\n      });\n      $('#next').click(function() { $('.slides').slidesjs('next'); });\n      $('#prev').click(function() { $('.slides').slidesjs('previous'); });\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis example adds custom \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons and disables the default navigation. It also uses a fade transition and autoplay.\n\n\n### Integration with other frameworks\n\nSlidesJS can be integrated with various JavaScript frameworks.  The examples above already showcase integration with jQuery. For other frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular), you would typically include SlidesJS as part of your component and use its API methods within the framework's lifecycle methods. The integration will heavily depend on how your framework manages DOM elements and event handling.  You'd handle the initialization and API calls within your component's logic.  Refer to the specific documentation of your framework for more guidance.\n\n\n### Real-world Use Cases\n\n* **Product Showcases:** Displaying a series of product images or videos.\n* **Image Galleries:** Creating interactive image galleries with navigation.\n* **Website Intros:**  Creating an engaging introduction to a website using a slideshow.\n* **Tutorials and Guides:** Presenting step-by-step instructions or walkthroughs.\n* **Presentations:**  Delivering presentations online using slides with text and images.\n* **News Rotators:** Displaying recent news items or announcements.\n* **Testimonials:**  Showcasing client testimonials with images or videos.\n\nThe versatility of SlidesJS allows for various applications where a visually appealing and interactive slideshow is beneficial.  Remember to tailor your implementation to your specific requirements and the overall design of your website or application.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
