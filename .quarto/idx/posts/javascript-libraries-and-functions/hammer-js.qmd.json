It provides a consistent and cross-browser API for detecting various touch events such as taps, swipes, pinches, and rotates, abstracting away the complexities of handling different browser and device implementations.  Instead of dealing with raw touch events, you can use Hammer.js's high-level gestures, simplifying development and improving consistency across platforms.\n\n### Why use Hammer.js?\n\nUsing Hammer.js offers several key advantages:\n\n* **Cross-browser compatibility:** Hammer.js handles the inconsistencies between different browsers and devices, providing a unified interface for gesture recognition.  This eliminates the need for extensive browser-specific code.\n* **Simplified gesture detection:**  Instead of dealing with multiple raw touch events, you can directly use predefined gestures. This significantly reduces the amount of code needed and simplifies development.\n* **Extensible and customizable:** Hammer.js allows you to easily extend its functionality and customize the behavior of gestures to fit your specific needs.  You can create custom recognizers or modify existing ones.\n* **Lightweight and efficient:** Hammer.js is designed to be small and efficient, minimizing its impact on your application's performance.\n\n\n### Setting up Hammer.js: Installation and Inclusion\n\nHammer.js can be included in your project in a few ways:\n\n* **CDN:** The simplest way is to include it via a CDN link in your HTML file:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://hammerjs.github.io/dist/hammer.js\"></script>\n```\n\n* **NPM:** If you're using a Node.js-based workflow, you can install it using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install hammerjs\n```\n\nThen, import it into your JavaScript code:\n\n```javascript\nimport Hammer from 'hammerjs';\n```\n\n* **Download:** You can also download the library directly from the GitHub repository and include it locally.\n\n\nAfter including Hammer.js, you can start using its API to detect and respond to gestures.\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nHammer.js supports a wide range of modern browsers and devices.  While it aims for broad compatibility, optimal performance and support for all features are generally best achieved using modern, up-to-date browsers.  Refer to the official Hammer.js documentation and release notes for the most up-to-date compatibility information, as browser support may evolve over time.  Generally, you can expect good support across major desktop browsers and mobile browsers on iOS and Android.\n\n\n## Getting Started with Hammer.js\n\n### Creating a Hammer Instance\n\nThe first step to using Hammer.js is creating a Hammer instance. This instance is associated with a specific DOM element and will listen for gestures on that element.  You create a Hammer instance using the `Hammer` constructor, passing the target element as an argument.  Optionally, you can also pass a configuration object to customize the behavior.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Get the target element\nconst element = document.getElementById('myElement');\n\n// Create a Hammer instance\nconst hammer = new Hammer(element);\n\n// Optionally, pass a configuration object (see below for details)\n//const hammer = new Hammer(element, {\n//  recognizers: [/* ... */]\n//});\n```\n\nThis creates a `hammer` object that you can use to manage gesture recognition for the element with the ID `myElement`.\n\n\n### Recognizers: Understanding the Basics\n\nHammer.js uses *recognizers* to detect different gestures. A recognizer is a specific type of gesture, such as a tap, swipe, pinch, or rotate.  Each recognizer has its own set of criteria for determining if a gesture has occurred.  By default, Hammer.js includes several built-in recognizers, and you can also create custom recognizers for more specialized needs.  Some common built-in recognizers include:\n\n* `Tap`: Detects a single touch event.\n* `DoubleTap`: Detects two consecutive tap events.\n* `Swipe`: Detects a quick movement of the finger across the screen.\n* `Pinch`: Detects a pinching or spreading gesture with two fingers.\n* `Rotate`: Detects a rotation gesture with two fingers.\n* `Pan`: Detects dragging or panning gestures.\n\nEach recognizer can have options to fine-tune its behavior (e.g., specifying minimum swipe distance or velocity).\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nHammer.js uses events to notify you when a gesture has occurred.  You add event listeners to the Hammer instance using the `on()` method.  The first argument is the gesture event name (e.g., `'tap'`, `'swipe'`, `'pinch'`), and the second is a callback function that will be executed when the event occurs. The callback function receives a `event` object containing information about the gesture.\n\n\n```javascript\nhammer.on('tap', (ev) => {\n  console.log('Tap event:', ev);\n});\n```\n\nThis code adds a listener for the `tap` event.  When a tap occurs on `myElement`, the callback function will be executed, and the `ev` object will contain details like coordinates, timestamp and more.  Other events like `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `pinchin`, `pinchout`, `rotate` etc, are also available.\n\n\n### Basic Example: Detecting Taps\n\nThis example shows how to detect taps on an element:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Hammer.js Tap Example</title>\n  <script src=\"https://hammerjs.github.io/dist/hammer.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"myElement\">Tap me!</div>\n  <script>\n    const element = document.getElementById('myElement');\n    const hammer = new Hammer(element);\n    hammer.on('tap', (ev) => {\n      alert('Tapped!');\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code creates a div element, and when you tap it an alert box will appear.\n\n### Handling Multiple Recognizers\n\nYou can add multiple recognizers to a single Hammer instance.  Hammer.js will automatically manage conflicts between recognizers to determine which gesture has occurred.  You can achieve this by adding multiple `on()` handlers for different events or by providing an array of recognizers in the configuration object during instance creation.\n\n\n```javascript\nhammer.on('tap', (ev) => {\n  console.log('Tapped!');\n});\nhammer.on('swipe', (ev) => {\n  console.log('Swiped:', ev.direction);\n});\n```\n\nThis code listens for both `tap` and `swipe` events on the same element.  Hammer.js will handle the situation where a swipe might also trigger a tap, and typically choose the more significant gesture.  More fine grained control can be gained through recognizer configuration.\n\n\n## Core Recognizers\n\n### Tap\n\nThe `tap` recognizer detects a quick touch and release on the element.  It's essentially a single touch event without significant movement.\n\n* **Event:** `tap`\n* **Options:**\n    * `taps`: The number of taps required (default: 1).  This option is typically used in conjunction with the `doubletap` recognizer.  Setting to a value greater than 1 will result in the `tap` event not firing if a double tap is detected.\n    * `intervalTime`: The maximum time between taps (in milliseconds) for a multi-tap gesture (default: 250).\n    * `posThreshold`: The maximum distance (in pixels) the finger can move during the tap (default: 10).\n    * `timeThreshold`: The maximum time (in milliseconds) the touch can be pressed before it's considered a tap (default: 250).\n* **Event Properties:** The event object will contain standard properties like `center`, `timeStamp` etc..\n\n### Double Tap\n\nThe `doubletap` recognizer detects two consecutive taps within a short time and distance.\n\n* **Event:** `doubletap`\n* **Options:** Inherits options from `tap` recognizer, but `taps` is implicitly set to 2.\n* **Event Properties:** Similar to `tap`, but indicates a double tap occurred.\n\n### Press\n\nThe `press` recognizer detects a touch that is held down for a specified duration.\n\n* **Event:** `press`\n* **Options:**\n    * `time`: The minimum time (in milliseconds) the touch must be held down before the `press` event is triggered (default: 500).\n* **Event Properties:**  Provides information like press duration and touch coordinates.\n\n### Swipe\n\nThe `swipe` recognizer detects a quick, sliding movement of the finger across the screen.\n\n* **Event:** `swipe`, `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `swipeup`, `swipedown` (directional events are also fired)\n* **Options:**\n    * `direction`:  Specifies the allowed swipe directions ('horizontal', 'vertical', 'all' - default: 'all').\n    * `velocity`: The minimum velocity (in pixels per second) required for a swipe (default: 0.3).\n    * `threshold`: The minimum distance (in pixels) the finger must move before a swipe is detected (default: 30).\n* **Event Properties:** Includes direction (`direction`), velocity (`velocity`), and coordinate information.\n\n### Pan\n\nThe `pan` recognizer detects dragging or panning movements.  It's triggered continuously while the finger is moving.\n\n* **Event:** `pan`, `panstart`, `panmove`, `panend`, `panleft`, `panright`, `panup`, `pandown`\n* **Options:**\n    * `direction`: Specifies the allowed pan directions ('horizontal', 'vertical', 'all' - default: 'all').\n    * `threshold`: Minimum distance (in pixels) to trigger a `panstart` event (default: 0)\n* **Event Properties:** Includes delta (`deltaX`, `deltaY`), velocity (`velocityX`, `velocityY`), and coordinate information.  The delta properties show the change in position since the last event.\n\n\n### Pinch\n\nThe `pinch` recognizer detects a pinching or spreading gesture using two fingers.\n\n* **Event:** `pinch`, `pinchstart`, `pinchmove`, `pinchin`, `pinchout`\n* **Options:**\n    * `threshold`: Minimum scale change to trigger a `pinchstart` event.\n* **Event Properties:** Includes scale (`scale`), rotation (`rotation`), velocity and coordinate information.  The `scale` property represents the scaling factor (1.0 is no change, > 1.0 is zoom in, < 1.0 is zoom out).\n\n### Rotate\n\nThe `rotate` recognizer detects a rotation gesture using two fingers.\n\n* **Event:** `rotate`, `rotatestart`, `rotate`, `rotateend`\n* **Options:**\n    * `threshold`: Minimum rotation (in degrees) to trigger a `rotatestart` event (default: 0).\n* **Event Properties:** Includes rotation (`rotation`) and velocity information.\n\n### Release\n\nThe `release` recognizer is triggered when a single touch is released, it is not a gesture recognizer in the same sense as the others.\n\n* **Event:** `release`\n* **Options:**  No specific options.\n* **Event Properties:**  Provides information about the released touch point.  Often used in conjunction with other gestures to provide a clean end point.\n\n\n\n## Advanced Recognizer Configuration\n\n### Event Properties\n\nHammer.js events provide a rich set of properties within the event object passed to your event handlers.  These properties provide detailed information about the gesture, including:\n\n* **`center`:**  An object containing the x and y coordinates of the gesture's center point.\n* **`deltaX` / `deltaY`:** The change in x and y coordinates since the last event (for continuous gestures like `pan` and `pinch`).\n* **`distance`:** The total distance of movement (often used in swipe and pan).\n* **`angle`:**  The angle of the gesture (often used in rotate and swipe).\n* **`rotation`:** The rotation in degrees (for rotate and pinch).\n* **`scale`:** The scaling factor (for pinch).\n* **`velocityX` / `velocityY`:** The velocity of the gesture in pixels per second.\n* **`target`:** The DOM element where the gesture occurred.\n* **`timeStamp`:** The timestamp when the event occurred.\n* **`srcEvent`:** The original browser event (e.g., `TouchEvent` or `MouseEvent`).\n* **`isFinal`:**  Boolean indicating if this is the final event for the gesture. (e.g., `panend`, `pinchend`)\n\n\nMany of these properties are specific to certain recognizers; consult the individual recognizer documentation for details on which properties are available.\n\n\n### Recognizer Options (`enable`, `direction`, `threshold`, etc.)\n\nEach recognizer has a set of options that you can use to customize its behavior.  These options are passed as a JavaScript object when you create a recognizer (or when adding them to the Hammer instance's `recognizers` array). Common options include:\n\n* **`enable`:** (boolean) Enables or disables the recognizer.  Useful for dynamically turning gestures on or off.\n* **`direction`:** (string)  Specifies the allowed direction(s) for the gesture ('horizontal', 'vertical', 'all', 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down').  The specific options vary per recognizer.\n* **`threshold`:** (number)  Specifies the minimum movement (in pixels or degrees) required to trigger the recognizer.\n* **`velocity`:** (number) Specifies the minimum velocity (pixels/second) for swipe/pan recognizers.\n* `time`: (number) Specifies a time threshold (milliseconds) (often for `press` and `tap`).\n* `taps`: (number) Number of taps required (for `tap` and `doubletap`).\n* `intervalTime`: (number) Time interval between taps for multi-tap gestures.\n* `posThreshold`: (number) Maximum distance allowed between taps (for multi-tap gestures).\n\n\nFor example, to customize the `swipe` recognizer to only detect horizontal swipes with a minimum velocity of 0.5:\n\n```javascript\nconst hammer = new Hammer(element, {\n  recognizers: [\n    [Hammer.Swipe, { direction: Hammer.DIRECTION_HORIZONTAL, velocity: 0.5 }]\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n\n### Customizing Recognizer Behavior\n\nBeyond the built-in options, you can further customize the behavior of recognizers by extending them or creating your own custom recognizers. This involves creating a class that inherits from `Hammer.Recognizer` and overriding its methods to implement your custom logic.  This is advanced usage and requires a deeper understanding of the Hammer.js architecture.\n\n\n### Preventing Default Browser Behavior\n\nBrowser often have default behaviors for touch events (e.g., scrolling).  To prevent these defaults from interfering with your gesture handling, use the `preventDefault()` method on the event object within your gesture handler.\n\n```javascript\nhammer.on('pan', (ev) => {\n  ev.preventDefault(); // Prevent default browser scrolling behavior\n  // ... your pan handling logic ...\n});\n```\n\nUse this carefully, as preventing default behavior can have unintended side effects.  It might prevent scrolling or other essential browser actions.\n\n\n### Input Type Management\n\nHammer.js can handle different types of input (touch, mouse, pointer).  By default, it attempts to use the most appropriate input type for the current device and browser.  You can manage the input types using options during the `Hammer` instance creation or configuration.\n\n\n### Using Multiple Recognizers Simultaneously\n\nHammer.js allows you to use multiple recognizers on the same element. It intelligently manages conflicts between recognizers based on priority and criteria to select the most appropriate gesture.  Order in the `recognizers` array can affect this selection.\n\n\n### Recognizer Priority and Conflicts\n\nWhen multiple recognizers might match the same input sequence, Hammer.js uses a priority system to determine which recognizer should be triggered.  Recognizers with higher priority are checked first.  You can influence priority by the order you define the recognizers in the configuration.  If you create a custom recognizer, you will need to define its priority explicitly.  Understanding this priority order is crucial for resolving potential conflicts when using several recognizers on the same element.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Using Hammer.js with Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)\n\nHammer.js can be integrated into various JavaScript frameworks.  The specific implementation details vary depending on the framework, but the general approach is consistent:\n\n* **React:**  You typically use a `ref` to get a reference to the DOM element and then create a Hammer instance after the component mounts.  Lifecycle methods like `useEffect` are helpful for managing the Hammer instance.  Remember to clean up the Hammer instance when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.\n\n* **Angular:**  You can use `@ViewChild` to access the DOM element within your Angular component and then create the Hammer instance.  Lifecycle hooks (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`) manage instance creation and cleanup.\n\n* **Vue:**  You can use a `ref` to access the DOM element and create the Hammer instance within the `mounted` lifecycle hook and remove the listener in the `beforeUnmount` hook.\n\nIn all cases, the core Hammer.js API remains the same; the framework integration mostly manages the lifecycle and DOM element access.\n\n\n### Integration with Other Libraries\n\nHammer.js can often be combined with other JavaScript libraries.  However, ensure that there are no conflicts between event handling or DOM manipulation.  For example, if you use a library that already handles touch events, you might need to carefully coordinate the event handling to avoid conflicts or unexpected behavior.  Pay close attention to event priorities and how each library interacts with the underlying DOM events.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Recognizers\n\nFor gestures not covered by the built-in recognizers, you can create your own. This involves subclassing `Hammer.Recognizer` and overriding methods like `recognizeWith`, `canRecognizeWith`, `getTouchAction`, and the core recognition methods (`onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`).  You'll define the logic to detect your custom gesture and emit custom events. This is advanced usage and requires a solid understanding of gesture recognition and Hammer.js's internal workings.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance:\n\n* **Minimize DOM manipulations:**  Perform expensive DOM operations outside the gesture event handlers whenever possible.  Keep your event handlers lightweight to avoid performance bottlenecks.\n* **Use requestAnimationFrame:**  When updating the UI based on gesture events, use `requestAnimationFrame` to coordinate updates with the browser's rendering cycle for smoother animation.\n* **Optimize recognizer usage:** Only include the recognizers you actually need; unnecessary recognizers can increase overhead.\n* **Consider using a virtualized list:** For applications with long lists of scrollable items, using a virtualized list (like react-window or similar) is essential to maintain smooth scrolling performance, especially on mobile devices.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\nCommon issues and their solutions:\n\n* **Gestures not working:**  Ensure you've correctly included Hammer.js, created the Hammer instance on the correct element, and have the correct event listeners. Inspect your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors.\n* **Conflicts with other libraries:** Check for conflicts in event handling by examining which libraries are registering listeners for touch events and if they interfere with each other.\n* **Performance problems:** Use performance profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your application.  Optimize your event handlers and DOM manipulations.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nEnsure your application remains usable for users with disabilities:\n\n* **Provide alternative input methods:** Offer keyboard or mouse equivalents for gesture-based interactions to provide accessibility to users who cannot use touch input.\n* **Clear visual feedback:** Provide visual feedback indicating when gestures are recognized to make the application more usable for users with visual impairments.\n* **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate semantic HTML elements to make your application more understandable for assistive technologies like screen readers.\n* **ARIA attributes:** For more complex gestures, consider using ARIA attributes to provide further context for assistive technologies.  This helps convey the state and purpose of interactive elements more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a concise overview of the Hammer.js API.  For complete and up-to-date details, refer to the official Hammer.js documentation.\n\n### Hammer Instance Methods\n\nThe `Hammer` instance (created using `new Hammer(element, [options])`) provides several methods for managing gesture recognition:\n\n* **`on(eventName, handler)`:** Attaches an event listener for the specified gesture event.  `eventName` is a string representing the gesture (e.g., 'tap', 'swipe', 'pan').  `handler` is a callback function executed when the event occurs.\n\n* **`off(eventName, [handler])`:** Removes an event listener.  If `handler` is omitted, all listeners for `eventName` are removed.\n\n* **`destroy()`:**  Completely destroys the Hammer instance, removing all event listeners and freeing resources.  This is essential to prevent memory leaks, especially in components that mount and unmount.\n\n* **`get(recognizerName)`:** Returns a specific Recognizer instance associated with the Hammer instance.\n\n* **`set(options)`:** Allows changing configuration settings dynamically after Hammer instance creation.\n\n* **`emit(eventName, data)`:** Allows programmatically triggering a Hammer event.  Useful for testing or custom event handling within the application's logic.\n\n* **`stop()`:** Stops the processing of ongoing gestures. Useful when you need to abruptly end recognition.\n\n\n### Recognizer Object Properties and Methods\n\nEach recognizer object (accessible through `hammer.get('recognizerName')`) has properties and methods to control its behavior. Key properties include:\n\n* **`options`:** An object containing the configuration options for the recognizer (e.g., `threshold`, `direction`, `enable`).  These are the options provided when defining the Recognizer, which can be read and modified even after instantiation of the recognizer.\n\n* **`state`:** Reflects the current state of the recognizer (e.g., `Hammer.STATE_POSSIBLE`, `Hammer.STATE_STARTED`, `Hammer.STATE_ENDED`).  Use this to track the progress of the gesture.\n\n* **`recognizeWith`:**  (Array or Recognizer) Specifies which recognizers this one should try to combine with or prevent from triggering simultaneously (affects priority).  Can be set both when creating the recognizer and afterward.\n\n* **`requireFailure`:** (Array or Recognizer) An array of recognizers that must fail for this recognizer to trigger.  Useful for managing gesture conflicts.\n\n\nMethods available on a recognizer instance are limited but important, enabling dynamic changes to its behavior:\n\n\n* **`set(options)`:** Modify the recognizer's configuration options at runtime.\n* **`enable()`:** Enables the recognizer.\n* **`disable()`:** Disables the recognizer.\n\n\n### Event Object Properties\n\nThe event object passed to the event handlers contains comprehensive information about the gesture:\n\n* **`type`:** The type of the event (e.g., 'tap', 'swipe', 'panstart', 'pinchmove').\n\n* **`target`:** The DOM element the gesture occurred on.\n\n* **`center`:** An object with `x` and `y` coordinates representing the center of the gesture.\n\n* **`deltaTime`:** The time elapsed since the start of the gesture (in milliseconds).\n\n* **`timeStamp`:**  Timestamp of the event.\n\n* **`angle`:**  Angle of the gesture (in degrees, typically for swipe and rotate).\n\n* **`distance`:** Distance of movement since gesture start (for swipe and pan).\n\n* **`deltaX`, `deltaY`:** Change in X and Y coordinates since the last event (for pan and pinch).\n\n* **`velocityX`, `velocityY`:** Velocity of the gesture along X and Y axes.\n\n* **`scale`:**  Scaling factor (for pinch).\n\n* **`rotation`:** Rotation in degrees (for rotate).\n\n* **`srcEvent`:** The underlying browser event object.\n\n* **`isFinal`:** Boolean indicating whether this is the last event for this gesture.\n\n* **`direction`:** Direction of swipe (e.g., `'left'`, `'right'`, `'up'`, `'down'`).\n\nRemember to check the documentation for the specific properties available for each type of event.  The properties listed are common, but not exhaustive.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section showcases common use cases for Hammer.js and provides conceptual guidance.  Specific implementation details will depend on your application's structure and design.\n\n### Interactive Image Gallery\n\nA common use case involves creating an image gallery with touch gestures for navigation.  You can use swipe gestures to move between images, pinch to zoom, and potentially double-tap to zoom in/out.\n\n* **Implementation:**  You'd create a container element holding the images.  Using Hammer.js, you'd listen for `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `pinch`, and `doubletap` events.  The event handlers would update the displayed image or its scale based on the detected gesture.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Efficiently manage image loading and caching to prevent performance issues with large galleries.  Implement smooth transitions between images for a polished user experience.\n\n### Touch-Enabled Navigation Menu\n\nA touch-enabled navigation menu can use swipe gestures to reveal or hide the menu, or tap gestures to select menu items.\n\n* **Implementation:**  You can use a `swipeleft` or `swiperight` gesture to slide in/out a navigation menu from the side of the screen.  Individual menu items can use `tap` gestures to trigger actions.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Consider the menu's placement and animation to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience. Ensure accessibility by providing alternative ways to access the menu for users who can't use touch input.\n\n### Scalable and Rotatable Maps\n\nMaps often benefit from pinch-to-zoom and rotate gestures.\n\n* **Implementation:**  Use the `pinch` and `rotate` recognizers to handle scaling and rotation, respectively.  The event handlers would update the map's view based on the detected gestures.  You'll likely integrate with a mapping library (like Leaflet or Google Maps) to manage the map's rendering.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Implement bounds checking to prevent zooming beyond the map's limits.  Ensure smooth transitions to prevent jarring movements during zooming or rotation.\n\n### Drag-and-Drop Interface\n\nHammer.js can facilitate drag-and-drop functionality.  Use the `pan` recognizer to track the element's movement, updating its position based on the `deltaX` and `deltaY` properties.\n\n* **Implementation:** Attach the `panstart`, `panmove`, and `panend` event listeners to the draggable element.  During the `panmove` event, update the element's position.  You might need additional logic to handle drop zones and constraints.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Provide visual feedback (e.g., highlighting drop zones) to make the drag-and-drop experience intuitive.  Implement appropriate constraints to prevent elements from being dragged outside their allowed areas.\n\n### Gesture-Based Game Controls\n\nMany games benefit from intuitive gesture controls.  You can use various recognizers for different actions: swipes for movement, taps for actions, pinches for zooming, and more.\n\n* **Implementation:** Map different gestures to actions within your game.  For example, `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `swipeup`, `swipedown` could control character movement, while a `tap` could trigger an attack or interaction.  `Pinch` could be used to zoom in/out on the game world.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Provide clear visual or auditory feedback to communicate the results of the user's gestures.  Balance responsiveness with responsiveness to avoid input lag or frustrating gameplay.\n\n\nRemember that these are high-level overviews. The specific implementation details depend on your project's requirements, UI framework, and any other libraries you are using.  Careful consideration of event handling, animation, and error handling are crucial to create a robust and user-friendly experience.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Introduction to Hammer.js\n\n### What is Hammer.js?\n\nHammer.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows you to easily add touch gestures to your web applications.

While it aims for broad compatibility, optimal performance and support for all features are generally best achieved using modern, up-to-date browsers.  Refer to the official Hammer.js documentation and release notes for the most up-to-date compatibility information, as browser support may evolve over time.  Generally, you can expect good support across major desktop browsers and mobile browsers on iOS and Android.\n\n\n## Getting Started with Hammer.js\n\n### Creating a Hammer Instance\n\nThe first step to using Hammer.js is creating a Hammer instance. This instance is associated with a specific DOM element and will listen for gestures on that element.  You create a Hammer instance using the `Hammer` constructor, passing the target element as an argument.  Optionally, you can also pass a configuration object to customize the behavior.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Get the target element\nconst element = document.getElementById('myElement');\n\n// Create a Hammer instance\nconst hammer = new Hammer(element);\n\n// Optionally, pass a configuration object (see below for details)\n//const hammer = new Hammer(element, {\n//  recognizers: [/* ... */]\n//});\n```\n\nThis creates a `hammer` object that you can use to manage gesture recognition for the element with the ID `myElement`.\n\n\n### Recognizers: Understanding the Basics\n\nHammer.js uses *recognizers* to detect different gestures. A recognizer is a specific type of gesture, such as a tap, swipe, pinch, or rotate.  Each recognizer has its own set of criteria for determining if a gesture has occurred.  By default, Hammer.js includes several built-in recognizers, and you can also create custom recognizers for more specialized needs.  Some common built-in recognizers include:\n\n* `Tap`: Detects a single touch event.\n* `DoubleTap`: Detects two consecutive tap events.\n* `Swipe`: Detects a quick movement of the finger across the screen.\n* `Pinch`: Detects a pinching or spreading gesture with two fingers.\n* `Rotate`: Detects a rotation gesture with two fingers.\n* `Pan`: Detects dragging or panning gestures.\n\nEach recognizer can have options to fine-tune its behavior (e.g., specifying minimum swipe distance or velocity).\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nHammer.js uses events to notify you when a gesture has occurred.  You add event listeners to the Hammer instance using the `on()` method.  The first argument is the gesture event name (e.g., `'tap'`, `'swipe'`, `'pinch'`), and the second is a callback function that will be executed when the event occurs. The callback function receives a `event` object containing information about the gesture.\n\n\n```javascript\nhammer.on('tap', (ev) => {\n  console.log('Tap event:', ev);\n});\n```\n\nThis code adds a listener for the `tap` event.  When a tap occurs on `myElement`, the callback function will be executed, and the `ev` object will contain details like coordinates, timestamp and more.  Other events like `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `pinchin`, `pinchout`, `rotate` etc, are also available.\n\n\n### Basic Example: Detecting Taps\n\nThis example shows how to detect taps on an element:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Hammer.js Tap Example</title>\n  <script src=\"https://hammerjs.github.io/dist/hammer.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"myElement\">Tap me!</div>\n  <script>\n    const element = document.getElementById('myElement');\n    const hammer = new Hammer(element);\n    hammer.on('tap', (ev) => {\n      alert('Tapped!');\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code creates a div element, and when you tap it an alert box will appear.\n\n### Handling Multiple Recognizers\n\nYou can add multiple recognizers to a single Hammer instance.  Hammer.js will automatically manage conflicts between recognizers to determine which gesture has occurred.  You can achieve this by adding multiple `on()` handlers for different events or by providing an array of recognizers in the configuration object during instance creation.\n\n\n```javascript\nhammer.on('tap', (ev) => {\n  console.log('Tapped!');\n});\nhammer.on('swipe', (ev) => {\n  console.log('Swiped:', ev.direction);\n});\n```\n\nThis code listens for both `tap` and `swipe` events on the same element.  Hammer.js will handle the situation where a swipe might also trigger a tap, and typically choose the more significant gesture.  More fine grained control can be gained through recognizer configuration.\n\n\n## Core Recognizers\n\n### Tap\n\nThe `tap` recognizer detects a quick touch and release on the element.  It's essentially a single touch event without significant movement.\n\n* **Event:** `tap`\n* **Options:**\n    * `taps`: The number of taps required (default: 1).  This option is typically used in conjunction with the `doubletap` recognizer.  Setting to a value greater than 1 will result in the `tap` event not firing if a double tap is detected.\n    * `intervalTime`: The maximum time between taps (in milliseconds) for a multi-tap gesture (default: 250).\n    * `posThreshold`: The maximum distance (in pixels) the finger can move during the tap (default: 10).\n    * `timeThreshold`: The maximum time (in milliseconds) the touch can be pressed before it's considered a tap (default: 250).\n* **Event Properties:** The event object will contain standard properties like `center`, `timeStamp` etc..\n\n### Double Tap\n\nThe `doubletap` recognizer detects two consecutive taps within a short time and distance.\n\n* **Event:** `doubletap`\n* **Options:** Inherits options from `tap` recognizer, but `taps` is implicitly set to 2.\n* **Event Properties:** Similar to `tap`, but indicates a double tap occurred.\n\n### Press\n\nThe `press` recognizer detects a touch that is held down for a specified duration.\n\n* **Event:** `press`\n* **Options:**\n    * `time`: The minimum time (in milliseconds) the touch must be held down before the `press` event is triggered (default: 500).\n* **Event Properties:**  Provides information like press duration and touch coordinates.\n\n### Swipe\n\nThe `swipe` recognizer detects a quick, sliding movement of the finger across the screen.\n\n* **Event:** `swipe`, `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `swipeup`, `swipedown` (directional events are also fired)\n* **Options:**\n    * `direction`:  Specifies the allowed swipe directions ('horizontal', 'vertical', 'all' - default: 'all').\n    * `velocity`: The minimum velocity (in pixels per second) required for a swipe (default: 0.3).\n    * `threshold`: The minimum distance (in pixels) the finger must move before a swipe is detected (default: 30).\n* **Event Properties:** Includes direction (`direction`), velocity (`velocity`), and coordinate information.\n\n### Pan\n\nThe `pan` recognizer detects dragging or panning movements.  It's triggered continuously while the finger is moving.\n\n* **Event:** `pan`, `panstart`, `panmove`, `panend`, `panleft`, `panright`, `panup`, `pandown`\n* **Options:**\n    * `direction`: Specifies the allowed pan directions ('horizontal', 'vertical', 'all' - default: 'all').\n    * `threshold`: Minimum distance (in pixels) to trigger a `panstart` event (default: 0)\n* **Event Properties:** Includes delta (`deltaX`, `deltaY`), velocity (`velocityX`, `velocityY`), and coordinate information.  The delta properties show the change in position since the last event.\n\n\n### Pinch\n\nThe `pinch` recognizer detects a pinching or spreading gesture using two fingers.\n\n* **Event:** `pinch`, `pinchstart`, `pinchmove`, `pinchin`, `pinchout`\n* **Options:**\n    * `threshold`: Minimum scale change to trigger a `pinchstart` event.\n* **Event Properties:** Includes scale (`scale`), rotation (`rotation`), velocity and coordinate information.  The `scale` property represents the scaling factor (1.0 is no change, > 1.0 is zoom in, < 1.0 is zoom out).\n\n### Rotate\n\nThe `rotate` recognizer detects a rotation gesture using two fingers.\n\n* **Event:** `rotate`, `rotatestart`, `rotate`, `rotateend`\n* **Options:**\n    * `threshold`: Minimum rotation (in degrees) to trigger a `rotatestart` event (default: 0).\n* **Event Properties:** Includes rotation (`rotation`) and velocity information.\n\n### Release\n\nThe `release` recognizer is triggered when a single touch is released, it is not a gesture recognizer in the same sense as the others.\n\n* **Event:** `release`\n* **Options:**  No specific options.\n* **Event Properties:**  Provides information about the released touch point.  Often used in conjunction with other gestures to provide a clean end point.\n\n\n\n## Advanced Recognizer Configuration\n\n### Event Properties\n\nHammer.js events provide a rich set of properties within the event object passed to your event handlers.  These properties provide detailed information about the gesture, including:\n\n* **`center`:**  An object containing the x and y coordinates of the gesture's center point.\n* **`deltaX` / `deltaY`:** The change in x and y coordinates since the last event (for continuous gestures like `pan` and `pinch`).\n* **`distance`:** The total distance of movement (often used in swipe and pan).\n* **`angle`:**  The angle of the gesture (often used in rotate and swipe).\n* **`rotation`:** The rotation in degrees (for rotate and pinch).\n* **`scale`:** The scaling factor (for pinch).\n* **`velocityX` / `velocityY`:** The velocity of the gesture in pixels per second.\n* **`target`:** The DOM element where the gesture occurred.\n* **`timeStamp`:** The timestamp when the event occurred.\n* **`srcEvent`:** The original browser event (e.g., `TouchEvent` or `MouseEvent`).\n* **`isFinal`:**  Boolean indicating if this is the final event for the gesture. (e.g., `panend`, `pinchend`)\n\n\nMany of these properties are specific to certain recognizers; consult the individual recognizer documentation for details on which properties are available.\n\n\n### Recognizer Options (`enable`, `direction`, `threshold`, etc.)\n\nEach recognizer has a set of options that you can use to customize its behavior.  These options are passed as a JavaScript object when you create a recognizer (or when adding them to the Hammer instance's `recognizers` array). Common options include:\n\n* **`enable`:** (boolean) Enables or disables the recognizer.  Useful for dynamically turning gestures on or off.\n* **`direction`:** (string)  Specifies the allowed direction(s) for the gesture ('horizontal', 'vertical', 'all', 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down').  The specific options vary per recognizer.\n* **`threshold`:** (number)  Specifies the minimum movement (in pixels or degrees) required to trigger the recognizer.\n* **`velocity`:** (number) Specifies the minimum velocity (pixels/second) for swipe/pan recognizers.\n* `time`: (number) Specifies a time threshold (milliseconds) (often for `press` and `tap`).\n* `taps`: (number) Number of taps required (for `tap` and `doubletap`).\n* `intervalTime`: (number) Time interval between taps for multi-tap gestures.\n* `posThreshold`: (number) Maximum distance allowed between taps (for multi-tap gestures).\n\n\nFor example, to customize the `swipe` recognizer to only detect horizontal swipes with a minimum velocity of 0.5:\n\n```javascript\nconst hammer = new Hammer(element, {\n  recognizers: [\n    [Hammer.Swipe, { direction: Hammer.DIRECTION_HORIZONTAL, velocity: 0.5 }]\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n\n### Customizing Recognizer Behavior\n\nBeyond the built-in options, you can further customize the behavior of recognizers by extending them or creating your own custom recognizers. This involves creating a class that inherits from `Hammer.Recognizer` and overriding its methods to implement your custom logic.  This is advanced usage and requires a deeper understanding of the Hammer.js architecture.\n\n\n### Preventing Default Browser Behavior\n\nBrowser often have default behaviors for touch events (e.g., scrolling).  To prevent these defaults from interfering with your gesture handling, use the `preventDefault()` method on the event object within your gesture handler.\n\n```javascript\nhammer.on('pan', (ev) => {\n  ev.preventDefault(); // Prevent default browser scrolling behavior\n  // ... your pan handling logic ...\n});\n```\n\nUse this carefully, as preventing default behavior can have unintended side effects.  It might prevent scrolling or other essential browser actions.\n\n\n### Input Type Management\n\nHammer.js can handle different types of input (touch, mouse, pointer).  By default, it attempts to use the most appropriate input type for the current device and browser.  You can manage the input types using options during the `Hammer` instance creation or configuration.\n\n\n### Using Multiple Recognizers Simultaneously\n\nHammer.js allows you to use multiple recognizers on the same element. It intelligently manages conflicts between recognizers based on priority and criteria to select the most appropriate gesture.  Order in the `recognizers` array can affect this selection.\n\n\n### Recognizer Priority and Conflicts\n\nWhen multiple recognizers might match the same input sequence, Hammer.js uses a priority system to determine which recognizer should be triggered.  Recognizers with higher priority are checked first.  You can influence priority by the order you define the recognizers in the configuration.  If you create a custom recognizer, you will need to define its priority explicitly.  Understanding this priority order is crucial for resolving potential conflicts when using several recognizers on the same element.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Using Hammer.js with Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)\n\nHammer.js can be integrated into various JavaScript frameworks.  The specific implementation details vary depending on the framework, but the general approach is consistent:\n\n* **React:**  You typically use a `ref` to get a reference to the DOM element and then create a Hammer instance after the component mounts.  Lifecycle methods like `useEffect` are helpful for managing the Hammer instance.  Remember to clean up the Hammer instance when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.\n\n* **Angular:**  You can use `@ViewChild` to access the DOM element within your Angular component and then create the Hammer instance.  Lifecycle hooks (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnDestroy`) manage instance creation and cleanup.\n\n* **Vue:**  You can use a `ref` to access the DOM element and create the Hammer instance within the `mounted` lifecycle hook and remove the listener in the `beforeUnmount` hook.\n\nIn all cases, the core Hammer.js API remains the same; the framework integration mostly manages the lifecycle and DOM element access.\n\n\n### Integration with Other Libraries\n\nHammer.js can often be combined with other JavaScript libraries.  However, ensure that there are no conflicts between event handling or DOM manipulation.  For example, if you use a library that already handles touch events, you might need to carefully coordinate the event handling to avoid conflicts or unexpected behavior.  Pay close attention to event priorities and how each library interacts with the underlying DOM events.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Recognizers\n\nFor gestures not covered by the built-in recognizers, you can create your own. This involves subclassing `Hammer.Recognizer` and overriding methods like `recognizeWith`, `canRecognizeWith`, `getTouchAction`, and the core recognition methods (`onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`).  You'll define the logic to detect your custom gesture and emit custom events. This is advanced usage and requires a solid understanding of gesture recognition and Hammer.js's internal workings.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance:\n\n* **Minimize DOM manipulations:**  Perform expensive DOM operations outside the gesture event handlers whenever possible.  Keep your event handlers lightweight to avoid performance bottlenecks.\n* **Use requestAnimationFrame:**  When updating the UI based on gesture events, use `requestAnimationFrame` to coordinate updates with the browser's rendering cycle for smoother animation.\n* **Optimize recognizer usage:** Only include the recognizers you actually need; unnecessary recognizers can increase overhead.\n* **Consider using a virtualized list:** For applications with long lists of scrollable items, using a virtualized list (like react-window or similar) is essential to maintain smooth scrolling performance, especially on mobile devices.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\nCommon issues and their solutions:\n\n* **Gestures not working:**  Ensure you've correctly included Hammer.js, created the Hammer instance on the correct element, and have the correct event listeners. Inspect your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors.\n* **Conflicts with other libraries:** Check for conflicts in event handling by examining which libraries are registering listeners for touch events and if they interfere with each other.\n* **Performance problems:** Use performance profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your application.  Optimize your event handlers and DOM manipulations.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nEnsure your application remains usable for users with disabilities:\n\n* **Provide alternative input methods:** Offer keyboard or mouse equivalents for gesture-based interactions to provide accessibility to users who cannot use touch input.\n* **Clear visual feedback:** Provide visual feedback indicating when gestures are recognized to make the application more usable for users with visual impairments.\n* **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate semantic HTML elements to make your application more understandable for assistive technologies like screen readers.\n* **ARIA attributes:** For more complex gestures, consider using ARIA attributes to provide further context for assistive technologies.  This helps convey the state and purpose of interactive elements more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a concise overview of the Hammer.js API.  For complete and up-to-date details, refer to the official Hammer.js documentation.\n\n### Hammer Instance Methods\n\nThe `Hammer` instance (created using `new Hammer(element, [options])`) provides several methods for managing gesture recognition:\n\n* **`on(eventName, handler)`:** Attaches an event listener for the specified gesture event.  `eventName` is a string representing the gesture (e.g., 'tap', 'swipe', 'pan').  `handler` is a callback function executed when the event occurs.\n\n* **`off(eventName, [handler])`:** Removes an event listener.  If `handler` is omitted, all listeners for `eventName` are removed.\n\n* **`destroy()`:**  Completely destroys the Hammer instance, removing all event listeners and freeing resources.  This is essential to prevent memory leaks, especially in components that mount and unmount.\n\n* **`get(recognizerName)`:** Returns a specific Recognizer instance associated with the Hammer instance.\n\n* **`set(options)`:** Allows changing configuration settings dynamically after Hammer instance creation.\n\n* **`emit(eventName, data)`:** Allows programmatically triggering a Hammer event.  Useful for testing or custom event handling within the application's logic.\n\n* **`stop()`:** Stops the processing of ongoing gestures. Useful when you need to abruptly end recognition.\n\n\n### Recognizer Object Properties and Methods\n\nEach recognizer object (accessible through `hammer.get('recognizerName')`) has properties and methods to control its behavior. Key properties include:\n\n* **`options`:** An object containing the configuration options for the recognizer (e.g., `threshold`, `direction`, `enable`).  These are the options provided when defining the Recognizer, which can be read and modified even after instantiation of the recognizer.\n\n* **`state`:** Reflects the current state of the recognizer (e.g., `Hammer.STATE_POSSIBLE`, `Hammer.STATE_STARTED`, `Hammer.STATE_ENDED`).  Use this to track the progress of the gesture.\n\n* **`recognizeWith`:**  (Array or Recognizer) Specifies which recognizers this one should try to combine with or prevent from triggering simultaneously (affects priority).  Can be set both when creating the recognizer and afterward.\n\n* **`requireFailure`:** (Array or Recognizer) An array of recognizers that must fail for this recognizer to trigger.  Useful for managing gesture conflicts.\n\n\nMethods available on a recognizer instance are limited but important, enabling dynamic changes to its behavior:\n\n\n* **`set(options)`:** Modify the recognizer's configuration options at runtime.\n* **`enable()`:** Enables the recognizer.\n* **`disable()`:** Disables the recognizer.\n\n\n### Event Object Properties\n\nThe event object passed to the event handlers contains comprehensive information about the gesture:\n\n* **`type`:** The type of the event (e.g., 'tap', 'swipe', 'panstart', 'pinchmove').\n\n* **`target`:** The DOM element the gesture occurred on.\n\n* **`center`:** An object with `x` and `y` coordinates representing the center of the gesture.\n\n* **`deltaTime`:** The time elapsed since the start of the gesture (in milliseconds).\n\n* **`timeStamp`:**  Timestamp of the event.\n\n* **`angle`:**  Angle of the gesture (in degrees, typically for swipe and rotate).\n\n* **`distance`:** Distance of movement since gesture start (for swipe and pan).\n\n* **`deltaX`, `deltaY`:** Change in X and Y coordinates since the last event (for pan and pinch).\n\n* **`velocityX`, `velocityY`:** Velocity of the gesture along X and Y axes.\n\n* **`scale`:**  Scaling factor (for pinch).\n\n* **`rotation`:** Rotation in degrees (for rotate).\n\n* **`srcEvent`:** The underlying browser event object.\n\n* **`isFinal`:** Boolean indicating whether this is the last event for this gesture.\n\n* **`direction`:** Direction of swipe (e.g., `'left'`, `'right'`, `'up'`, `'down'`).\n\nRemember to check the documentation for the specific properties available for each type of event.  The properties listed are common, but not exhaustive.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section showcases common use cases for Hammer.js and provides conceptual guidance.  Specific implementation details will depend on your application's structure and design.\n\n### Interactive Image Gallery\n\nA common use case involves creating an image gallery with touch gestures for navigation.  You can use swipe gestures to move between images, pinch to zoom, and potentially double-tap to zoom in/out.\n\n* **Implementation:**  You'd create a container element holding the images.  Using Hammer.js, you'd listen for `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `pinch`, and `doubletap` events.  The event handlers would update the displayed image or its scale based on the detected gesture.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Efficiently manage image loading and caching to prevent performance issues with large galleries.  Implement smooth transitions between images for a polished user experience.\n\n### Touch-Enabled Navigation Menu\n\nA touch-enabled navigation menu can use swipe gestures to reveal or hide the menu, or tap gestures to select menu items.\n\n* **Implementation:**  You can use a `swipeleft` or `swiperight` gesture to slide in/out a navigation menu from the side of the screen.  Individual menu items can use `tap` gestures to trigger actions.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Consider the menu's placement and animation to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience. Ensure accessibility by providing alternative ways to access the menu for users who can't use touch input.\n\n### Scalable and Rotatable Maps\n\nMaps often benefit from pinch-to-zoom and rotate gestures.\n\n* **Implementation:**  Use the `pinch` and `rotate` recognizers to handle scaling and rotation, respectively.  The event handlers would update the map's view based on the detected gestures.  You'll likely integrate with a mapping library (like Leaflet or Google Maps) to manage the map's rendering.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Implement bounds checking to prevent zooming beyond the map's limits.  Ensure smooth transitions to prevent jarring movements during zooming or rotation.\n\n### Drag-and-Drop Interface\n\nHammer.js can facilitate drag-and-drop functionality.  Use the `pan` recognizer to track the element's movement, updating its position based on the `deltaX` and `deltaY` properties.\n\n* **Implementation:** Attach the `panstart`, `panmove`, and `panend` event listeners to the draggable element.  During the `panmove` event, update the element's position.  You might need additional logic to handle drop zones and constraints.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Provide visual feedback (e.g., highlighting drop zones) to make the drag-and-drop experience intuitive.  Implement appropriate constraints to prevent elements from being dragged outside their allowed areas.\n\n### Gesture-Based Game Controls\n\nMany games benefit from intuitive gesture controls.  You can use various recognizers for different actions: swipes for movement, taps for actions, pinches for zooming, and more.\n\n* **Implementation:** Map different gestures to actions within your game.  For example, `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `swipeup`, `swipedown` could control character movement, while a `tap` could trigger an attack or interaction.  `Pinch` could be used to zoom in/out on the game world.\n\n* **Considerations:**  Provide clear visual or auditory feedback to communicate the results of the user's gestures.  Balance responsiveness with responsiveness to avoid input lag or frustrating gameplay.\n\n\nRemember that these are high-level overviews. The specific implementation details depend on your project's requirements, UI framework, and any other libraries you are using.  Careful consideration of event handling, animation, and error handling are crucial to create a robust and user-friendly experience.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
