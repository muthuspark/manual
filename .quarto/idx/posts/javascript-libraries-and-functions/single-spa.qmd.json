It allows you to build independent, deployable applications (often called \"microservices\" or \"microfrontends\") that can be combined to create a larger, more complex application.  Instead of a monolithic application, you have multiple smaller applications working together. This approach offers benefits such as improved code organization, independent deployments, and better team scalability.  single-spa handles the routing and lifecycle management of these individual applications, ensuring seamless integration and navigation between them.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nTo get started with single-spa, you'll need to install it using npm or yarn.  Open your terminal and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install single-spa\n# or\nyarn add single-spa\n```\n\nThis will install the core single-spa library in your main application.  You will also need to install separate packages for each of your microfrontends, though their installation depends on the framework they're built with (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).\n\n### Creating your first single-spa application\n\nThis section guides you through creating a simple single-spa application with a single microfrontend. We will use Parcel for simplicity, but you can adapt to Webpack or other bundlers.\n\n1. **Create a root application:** Create a new directory for your root single-spa application (e.g., `my-single-spa-app`).  Inside this directory, create the following files:\n\n   * `index.html`: This will be the main HTML file for your application.\n   * `index.js`: This will contain the single-spa configuration.\n   * `package.json`:  Define your project (using npm init -y).\n\n2. **`index.html`:**\n\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html>\n     <head>\n       <title>My Single-SPA App</title>\n     </head>\n     <body>\n       <div id=\"root\"></div>\n       <script src=\"/index.js\"></script>\n     </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n3. **`index.js`:**\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';\n\n   registerApplication(\n     'app1',\n     () => import('./app1.js'), //Import function for your app\n     () => location.pathname.startsWith('/app1') // active when route starts with '/app1'\n   );\n\n   start();\n   ```\n\n4. **`app1.js` (simple React example):** Create `app1.js` in the same directory.  This example assumes you have a basic React project set up already.\n\n   ```javascript\n   export async function bootstrap(props) {\n     console.log('app1 bootstrapped');\n     // your application's bootstrap logic, which will be called once before mounting.\n   }\n\n   export async function mount(props) {\n      const root = document.createElement('div');\n      root.id = 'root-app1';\n      document.body.appendChild(root);\n\n      //Mount your React app here, eg. ReactDOM.render(<App />, root);\n      console.log('app1 mounted');\n   }\n\n   export async function unmount(props) {\n     // your application's unmount logic, called once before the application is unmounted.\n      console.log('app1 unmounted');\n   }\n   ```\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder comment in `app1.js` with the actual mounting logic for your React app.\n\n\n### Running your application\n\nYou can use a simple static file server (like `parcel`) or a more sophisticated setup (like Webpack Dev Server).  For this example,  `parcel` is used:\n\n1. **Install Parcel:** `npm install -D parcel`\n2. **Run Parcel:** `parcel index.html`\n\n\nNavigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (the port will be displayed in your terminal) in your browser.  You should see your app1. Remember to navigate to `/app1` in your URL to activate your application.\n\n\n### Understanding the core concepts\n\nsingle-spa relies on several key concepts:\n\n* **Applications:** These are the independent microfrontends. Each application has its own lifecycle (bootstrap, mount, unmount) and is independently developed and deployed.\n\n* **Parcel/Webpack configuration (or other bundler):**  This is how you bundle your single-spa root config and how to bundle your individual applications.\n\n* **`registerApplication`:** This function registers a new application with single-spa. It takes three arguments: a unique name for the application, a function to load the application, and a function to determine when the application should be active (based on URL or other criteria).\n\n* **Lifecycle functions (`bootstrap`, `mount`, `unmount`):**  These functions control the application's lifecycle within single-spa. `bootstrap` performs initial setup, `mount` renders the application, and `unmount` cleans up after the application.\n\n* **`start()`:**  This function initiates the single-spa routing and lifecycle management.  It begins checking URL changes and activating/deactivating registered applications accordingly.\n\nUnderstanding these core concepts is fundamental to building robust and scalable single-spa applications.  Each concept will be elaborated on in later sections of this manual.\n\n\n## Defining Applications\n\n### Registering applications\n\nRegistering an application with single-spa makes it known to the single-spa router.  This is done using the `registerApplication` function.  This function takes three arguments:\n\n1. **`name` (String):** A unique name for your application.  This name is used internally by single-spa to identify and manage the application.\n\n2. **`app` (Function):** A function that returns a promise which resolves to the application's exported lifecycle functions (`bootstrap`, `mount`, `unmount`). This function is typically implemented using dynamic imports (`import()`).  This allows for lazy loading of your applications.\n\n3. **`activeWhen` (Function):** A function that returns a boolean indicating whether the application should be active based on the current URL or any other criteria.  This function is called frequently by single-spa to determine which application(s) should be mounted.\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nimport { registerApplication } from 'single-spa';\n\nregisterApplication(\n  'app1',\n  () => import('./app1.js'),\n  location => location.pathname === '/app1'\n);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n* `'app1'` is the application's name.\n* `() => import('./app1.js')` loads the application's lifecycle functions using dynamic import.\n* `location => location.pathname === '/app1'` makes the application active only when the URL pathname is exactly `/app1`.\n\n\n### Application lifecycles (mounting, booting, unmounting)\n\nEach single-spa application exposes three lifecycle functions:\n\n* **`bootstrap(props)`:** This function is called once, before the application is mounted for the first time. It's used for any one-time setup or initialization required by the application.  This function returns a promise.\n\n* **`mount(props)`:** This function is called whenever the application becomes active (as determined by `activeWhen`). It's where you actually render your application's UI into the DOM.  This function returns a promise.\n\n* **`unmount(props)`:** This function is called whenever the application becomes inactive. It's used to clean up the application, such as removing its DOM elements and unregistering any event listeners.  This function returns a promise.\n\nThese functions are passed a `props` object containing useful information such as the application's `name` and `customProps` (more on this below).  Each function should return a promise that resolves once the operation is complete.\n\n\n### Application URLs and routing\n\nsingle-spa doesn't handle routing *within* your microfrontends.  It only manages the activation and deactivation of microfrontends based on the URL.  Your `activeWhen` function dictates which application is active based on the current URL.  You can use any logic you want within `activeWhen`, including regular expressions for more complex routing.\n\nExample using a regular expression:\n\n```javascript\nregisterApplication(\n  'app2',\n  () => import('./app2.js'),\n  location => location.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')\n);\n```\n\nThis registers `app2` to be active whenever the URL starts with `/dashboard`.  The internal routing within `app2` would then handle navigation within the dashboard section.\n\n\n### Configuring application loading strategies\n\nBy default, single-spa loads applications using dynamic imports. However, you can customize the loading strategy. For instance, you might want to pre-load certain applications to improve perceived performance or have a different mechanism for loading certain applications.  This is often achieved by modifying the `app` function passed to `registerApplication`.\n\n\n### Working with different frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)\n\nsingle-spa is framework-agnostic.  You can build your microfrontends using any framework (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.). The key is that each microfrontend must export the `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` lifecycle functions in a way that single-spa understands.  The implementation of these functions will naturally vary depending on the framework you're using, but the interface to single-spa remains the same.\n\n\n### Advanced application configurations\n\n`customProps`:  You can pass custom data to your applications via the `customProps` option in the `registerApplication` function:\n\n```javascript\nregisterApplication(\n  'app3',\n  () => import('./app3.js'),\n  location => location.pathname === '/app3',\n  {\n      customProp1: 'value1',\n      customProp2: 123\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThis passes `{customProp1: 'value1', customProp2: 123}` to `app3`'s lifecycle functions in the `props` object.\n\n`loadError` Handling:  You can handle errors during the loading of your applications using a `.catch()` on the promise returned by the `app` function provided to `registerApplication`.\n\n\n### Creating and using custom lifecycles\n\nWhile `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` are the standard lifecycle functions, you can extend single-spa's functionality by creating and using custom lifecycle functions.  These are added using the `addErrorHandler`, `addLifeCycle` functions.   This allows you to add extra steps to the application lifecycle without modifying the core single-spa behavior.  Refer to the official single-spa documentation for details on how to implement custom lifecycles.\n\n\n## Parceling and Optimization\n\n### Understanding single-spa's parceling approach\n\nsingle-spa itself doesn't handle bundling or code splitting.  It relies on your build process (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, Rollup) to create separate bundles for each of your microfrontends.  The key is that each microfrontend should be independently buildable and deployable. single-spa's role is to orchestrate the loading and lifecycle management of these pre-built bundles.  It dynamically loads these bundles using techniques like dynamic `import()` statements, allowing for efficient lazy-loading.\n\n\n### Optimizing application load times\n\nOptimizing load times is crucial for a positive user experience in a single-spa application. Here are some strategies:\n\n* **Code Splitting:** Break down your applications into smaller, more manageable chunks.  Load only the necessary code when needed.  This is a fundamental aspect of optimizing a single-spa application.\n\n* **Lazy Loading:**  Load applications only when they are needed, based on the route or user interaction.  single-spa's `activeWhen` function is central to this.\n\n* **Caching:** Utilize browser caching mechanisms (e.g., service workers, HTTP caching headers) to avoid re-downloading application code if it hasn't changed.\n\n* **Minification and Compression:** Minify your JavaScript and CSS code to reduce file sizes.  Use GZIP or Brotli compression to further reduce transfer sizes.\n\n* **Pre-fetching/Pre-loading:** For frequently accessed applications, consider pre-loading or pre-fetching them in the background to reduce the perceived wait time.\n\n\n### Code-splitting and lazy-loading\n\nCode splitting is essential for optimizing single-spa applications.  Instead of having one large bundle for each microfrontend, split your code into smaller chunks based on functionality or features.  This reduces the initial load time and allows the browser to only download the code needed for the currently active application.  Modern bundlers like Webpack and Parcel offer robust support for code splitting.  The `import()` statement is how single-spa facilitates the lazy loading of these code chunks on demand.\n\n\n### Caching strategies\n\nEffective caching can significantly improve performance.  Leverage browser caching to avoid repeatedly downloading the same application code. This includes:\n\n* **HTTP Caching Headers:**  Configure appropriate `Cache-Control` headers on your application's assets to set appropriate caching policies (e.g., max-age).\n\n* **Service Workers:** Implement a service worker to cache application assets offline and improve load times even when the user is offline.\n\n* **Bundler Caching:** Many bundlers provide caching mechanisms that can speed up subsequent builds.\n\n\n### Working with different build tools\n\nsingle-spa is compatible with various build tools like Webpack, Parcel, Rollup, and others.  The choice of build tool depends on your project's needs and preferences.  Each tool has its own mechanisms for code splitting, optimization, and caching.  It's crucial to configure your chosen build tool correctly to optimize your single-spa application.  Ensure your configuration leverages features like code splitting, minification, and appropriate caching strategies.\n\n\n### Performance considerations\n\nPerformance considerations are crucial for a successful single-spa architecture:\n\n* **Avoid blocking rendering:** Ensure your application loading doesn't block the rendering of the main page.  Properly handle asynchronous loading to avoid the dreaded \"white screen of death.\"\n\n* **Optimize application size:** Smaller application bundles lead to faster load times.  Optimize your code, images, and other assets to reduce their size.\n\n* **Measure and monitor performance:** Regularly measure performance metrics (e.g., load time, time to interactive, bundle size) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.  This helps identify areas for improvement.\n\n* **Efficient DOM manipulation:** In your `mount` and `unmount` functions, minimize unnecessary DOM manipulation.  Use techniques like virtual DOM (if applicable) to improve rendering performance.\n\n* **Resource management:**  Ensure your applications release resources (e.g., event listeners) properly in their `unmount` function to prevent memory leaks.\n\nBy focusing on these optimization strategies, you can build high-performing single-spa applications that provide a smooth user experience.\n\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### Using single-spa with different routing libraries\n\nsingle-spa's core routing mechanism is based on the browser's URL.  However, you can integrate single-spa with other routing libraries, such as React Router, Angular Router, or Vue Router, within your individual microfrontends.  single-spa itself doesn't dictate or interfere with the internal routing of your microfrontends.  The `activeWhen` function in `registerApplication` determines which microfrontend is active based on the URL, and the internal routing libraries handle navigation within each microfrontend.  You might need to adjust how you handle navigation within each microfrontend to ensure smooth transitions between different parts of your application.\n\n\n### Handling errors and exceptions\n\nRobust error handling is essential for a production-ready single-spa application.  You should implement error handling at multiple levels:\n\n* **During application loading:** Use try-catch blocks around your `import()` statements in the `app` function passed to `registerApplication` to handle errors that may occur while loading a microfrontend.  The `loadError` function can be used for more advanced handling.\n\n* **Within microfrontend lifecycles:** Handle errors within the `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` functions of your microfrontends using appropriate error handling mechanisms specific to your chosen framework.\n\n* **Global error handling:** Consider using a global error handler (e.g., `window.onerror`) to catch any unhandled exceptions that might occur within your single-spa application.\n\n\n### Integrating with other libraries and tools\n\nsingle-spa is designed to work well with various libraries and tools. You can integrate it with:\n\n* **State management libraries:**  Redux, Zustand, Vuex, or NgRx can be used within your individual microfrontends to manage their state.\n\n* **UI component libraries:**  React Bootstrap, Material-UI, Ant Design, etc., can be integrated into your microfrontends.\n\n* **Testing frameworks:**  Jest, Cypress, Mocha, etc., are compatible for testing your microfrontends and the overall single-spa application.\n\n* **Analytics and monitoring tools:**  Integrate tools like Google Analytics or other monitoring services to track application usage and performance.\n\nThe key is to ensure that these integrations are done within the individual microfrontends, keeping them independent and loosely coupled.\n\n\n### Testing your application\n\nTesting a single-spa application requires a multi-faceted approach:\n\n* **Unit tests:**  Test individual components and functions within each microfrontend using appropriate testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, etc.).\n\n* **Integration tests:** Test the interaction between different microfrontends. This often involves simulating URL changes and verifying that the correct microfrontends are activated and deactivated.  Libraries like `single-spa-react` provide helper functions for integration testing.\n\n* **End-to-end tests:** Test the entire application flow using tools like Cypress or Selenium.\n\n* **Performance tests:** Measure load times, bundle sizes, and other performance metrics to ensure optimal performance.\n\n\n### Debugging and troubleshooting\n\nDebugging a single-spa application can be challenging due to its distributed nature.  Useful techniques include:\n\n* **Browser developer tools:**  Use the browser's developer tools (Network tab, Console tab) to inspect network requests, check for errors, and monitor performance.\n\n* **Logging:** Add logging statements to your microfrontends to track their lifecycle events and identify potential issues.\n\n* **Source maps:**  Enable source maps during your build process to debug your code in the browser.\n\n* **Debuggers:** Use a debugger (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to step through your code and identify the root cause of errors.\n\n\n### Security considerations\n\nSecurity is paramount.  Consider the following:\n\n* **Input validation:**  Sanitize user inputs within your microfrontends to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n* **Authentication and authorization:**  Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to your applications.  Consider using a central authentication service.\n\n* **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to secure communication between the browser and your application.\n\n* **Regular security audits:**  Perform regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Migrating from other microfrontend approaches\n\nMigrating from other microfrontend approaches (e.g., iframes, manual JavaScript loading) to single-spa involves refactoring your existing code to fit the single-spa lifecycle model.  This includes creating the `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` functions for each of your applications, and configuring the single-spa router. The complexity depends on the existing architecture.  Start with a small, self-contained component, migrate it to single-spa, and gradually migrate the remaining components.\n\n\n### Building a single-spa application with a monorepo\n\nA monorepo (a single repository containing multiple projects) can simplify the development and management of a single-spa application.  Tools like Nx, Turborepo, or Lerna can help manage the monorepo.  The key is to configure your build process (e.g., using workspaces in Webpack or similar features in other build tools) to build each microfrontend independently within the monorepo.  This enables efficient dependency management and shared code between your microfrontends.\n\n\n## Community and Support\n\n### Contributing to single-spa\n\nWe welcome contributions to single-spa!

It allows you to build independent, deployable applications (often called \"microservices\" or \"microfrontends\") that can be combined to create a larger, more complex application.  Instead of a monolithic application, you have multiple smaller applications working together. This approach offers benefits such as improved code organization, independent deployments, and better team scalability.  single-spa handles the routing and lifecycle management of these individual applications, ensuring seamless integration and navigation between them.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nTo get started with single-spa, you'll need to install it using npm or yarn.  Open your terminal and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install single-spa\n# or\nyarn add single-spa\n```\n\nThis will install the core single-spa library in your main application.  You will also need to install separate packages for each of your microfrontends, though their installation depends on the framework they're built with (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).\n\n### Creating your first single-spa application\n\nThis section guides you through creating a simple single-spa application with a single microfrontend. We will use Parcel for simplicity, but you can adapt to Webpack or other bundlers.\n\n1. **Create a root application:** Create a new directory for your root single-spa application (e.g., `my-single-spa-app`).  Inside this directory, create the following files:\n\n   * `index.html`: This will be the main HTML file for your application.\n   * `index.js`: This will contain the single-spa configuration.\n   * `package.json`:  Define your project (using npm init -y).\n\n2. **`index.html`:**\n\n   ```html\n   <!DOCTYPE html>\n   <html>\n     <head>\n       <title>My Single-SPA App</title>\n     </head>\n     <body>\n       <div id=\"root\"></div>\n       <script src=\"/index.js\"></script>\n     </body>\n   </html>\n   ```\n\n3. **`index.js`:**\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';\n\n   registerApplication(\n     'app1',\n     () => import('./app1.js'), //Import function for your app\n     () => location.pathname.startsWith('/app1') // active when route starts with '/app1'\n   );\n\n   start();\n   ```\n\n4. **`app1.js` (simple React example):** Create `app1.js` in the same directory.  This example assumes you have a basic React project set up already.\n\n   ```javascript\n   export async function bootstrap(props) {\n     console.log('app1 bootstrapped');\n     // your application's bootstrap logic, which will be called once before mounting.\n   }\n\n   export async function mount(props) {\n      const root = document.createElement('div');\n      root.id = 'root-app1';\n      document.body.appendChild(root);\n\n      //Mount your React app here, eg. ReactDOM.render(<App />, root);\n      console.log('app1 mounted');\n   }\n\n   export async function unmount(props) {\n     // your application's unmount logic, called once before the application is unmounted.\n      console.log('app1 unmounted');\n   }\n   ```\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder comment in `app1.js` with the actual mounting logic for your React app.\n\n\n### Running your application\n\nYou can use a simple static file server (like `parcel`) or a more sophisticated setup (like Webpack Dev Server).  For this example,  `parcel` is used:\n\n1. **Install Parcel:** `npm install -D parcel`\n2. **Run Parcel:** `parcel index.html`\n\n\nNavigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (the port will be displayed in your terminal) in your browser.  You should see your app1. Remember to navigate to `/app1` in your URL to activate your application.\n\n\n### Understanding the core concepts\n\nsingle-spa relies on several key concepts:\n\n* **Applications:** These are the independent microfrontends. Each application has its own lifecycle (bootstrap, mount, unmount) and is independently developed and deployed.\n\n* **Parcel/Webpack configuration (or other bundler):**  This is how you bundle your single-spa root config and how to bundle your individual applications.\n\n* **`registerApplication`:** This function registers a new application with single-spa. It takes three arguments: a unique name for the application, a function to load the application, and a function to determine when the application should be active (based on URL or other criteria).\n\n* **Lifecycle functions (`bootstrap`, `mount`, `unmount`):**  These functions control the application's lifecycle within single-spa. `bootstrap` performs initial setup, `mount` renders the application, and `unmount` cleans up after the application.\n\n* **`start()`:**  This function initiates the single-spa routing and lifecycle management.  It begins checking URL changes and activating/deactivating registered applications accordingly.\n\nUnderstanding these core concepts is fundamental to building robust and scalable single-spa applications.  Each concept will be elaborated on in later sections of this manual.\n\n\n## Defining Applications\n\n### Registering applications\n\nRegistering an application with single-spa makes it known to the single-spa router.  This is done using the `registerApplication` function.  This function takes three arguments:\n\n1. **`name` (String):** A unique name for your application.  This name is used internally by single-spa to identify and manage the application.\n\n2. **`app` (Function):** A function that returns a promise which resolves to the application's exported lifecycle functions (`bootstrap`, `mount`, `unmount`). This function is typically implemented using dynamic imports (`import()`).  This allows for lazy loading of your applications.\n\n3. **`activeWhen` (Function):** A function that returns a boolean indicating whether the application should be active based on the current URL or any other criteria.  This function is called frequently by single-spa to determine which application(s) should be mounted.\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nimport { registerApplication } from 'single-spa';\n\nregisterApplication(\n  'app1',\n  () => import('./app1.js'),\n  location => location.pathname === '/app1'\n);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n* `'app1'` is the application's name.\n* `() => import('./app1.js')` loads the application's lifecycle functions using dynamic import.\n* `location => location.pathname === '/app1'` makes the application active only when the URL pathname is exactly `/app1`.\n\n\n### Application lifecycles (mounting, booting, unmounting)\n\nEach single-spa application exposes three lifecycle functions:\n\n* **`bootstrap(props)`:** This function is called once, before the application is mounted for the first time. It's used for any one-time setup or initialization required by the application.  This function returns a promise.\n\n* **`mount(props)`:** This function is called whenever the application becomes active (as determined by `activeWhen`). It's where you actually render your application's UI into the DOM.  This function returns a promise.\n\n* **`unmount(props)`:** This function is called whenever the application becomes inactive. It's used to clean up the application, such as removing its DOM elements and unregistering any event listeners.  This function returns a promise.\n\nThese functions are passed a `props` object containing useful information such as the application's `name` and `customProps` (more on this below).  Each function should return a promise that resolves once the operation is complete.\n\n\n### Application URLs and routing\n\nsingle-spa doesn't handle routing *within* your microfrontends.  It only manages the activation and deactivation of microfrontends based on the URL.  Your `activeWhen` function dictates which application is active based on the current URL.  You can use any logic you want within `activeWhen`, including regular expressions for more complex routing.\n\nExample using a regular expression:\n\n```javascript\nregisterApplication(\n  'app2',\n  () => import('./app2.js'),\n  location => location.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')\n);\n```\n\nThis registers `app2` to be active whenever the URL starts with `/dashboard`.  The internal routing within `app2` would then handle navigation within the dashboard section.\n\n\n### Configuring application loading strategies\n\nBy default, single-spa loads applications using dynamic imports. However, you can customize the loading strategy. For instance, you might want to pre-load certain applications to improve perceived performance or have a different mechanism for loading certain applications.  This is often achieved by modifying the `app` function passed to `registerApplication`.\n\n\n### Working with different frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)\n\nsingle-spa is framework-agnostic.  You can build your microfrontends using any framework (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.). The key is that each microfrontend must export the `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` lifecycle functions in a way that single-spa understands.  The implementation of these functions will naturally vary depending on the framework you're using, but the interface to single-spa remains the same.\n\n\n### Advanced application configurations\n\n`customProps`:  You can pass custom data to your applications via the `customProps` option in the `registerApplication` function:\n\n```javascript\nregisterApplication(\n  'app3',\n  () => import('./app3.js'),\n  location => location.pathname === '/app3',\n  {\n      customProp1: 'value1',\n      customProp2: 123\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThis passes `{customProp1: 'value1', customProp2: 123}` to `app3`'s lifecycle functions in the `props` object.\n\n`loadError` Handling:  You can handle errors during the loading of your applications using a `.catch()` on the promise returned by the `app` function provided to `registerApplication`.\n\n\n### Creating and using custom lifecycles\n\nWhile `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` are the standard lifecycle functions, you can extend single-spa's functionality by creating and using custom lifecycle functions.  These are added using the `addErrorHandler`, `addLifeCycle` functions.   This allows you to add extra steps to the application lifecycle without modifying the core single-spa behavior.  Refer to the official single-spa documentation for details on how to implement custom lifecycles.\n\n\n## Parceling and Optimization\n\n### Understanding single-spa's parceling approach\n\nsingle-spa itself doesn't handle bundling or code splitting.  It relies on your build process (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, Rollup) to create separate bundles for each of your microfrontends.  The key is that each microfrontend should be independently buildable and deployable. single-spa's role is to orchestrate the loading and lifecycle management of these pre-built bundles.  It dynamically loads these bundles using techniques like dynamic `import()` statements, allowing for efficient lazy-loading.\n\n\n### Optimizing application load times\n\nOptimizing load times is crucial for a positive user experience in a single-spa application. Here are some strategies:\n\n* **Code Splitting:** Break down your applications into smaller, more manageable chunks.  Load only the necessary code when needed.  This is a fundamental aspect of optimizing a single-spa application.\n\n* **Lazy Loading:**  Load applications only when they are needed, based on the route or user interaction.  single-spa's `activeWhen` function is central to this.\n\n* **Caching:** Utilize browser caching mechanisms (e.g., service workers, HTTP caching headers) to avoid re-downloading application code if it hasn't changed.\n\n* **Minification and Compression:** Minify your JavaScript and CSS code to reduce file sizes.  Use GZIP or Brotli compression to further reduce transfer sizes.\n\n* **Pre-fetching/Pre-loading:** For frequently accessed applications, consider pre-loading or pre-fetching them in the background to reduce the perceived wait time.\n\n\n### Code-splitting and lazy-loading\n\nCode splitting is essential for optimizing single-spa applications.  Instead of having one large bundle for each microfrontend, split your code into smaller chunks based on functionality or features.  This reduces the initial load time and allows the browser to only download the code needed for the currently active application.  Modern bundlers like Webpack and Parcel offer robust support for code splitting.  The `import()` statement is how single-spa facilitates the lazy loading of these code chunks on demand.\n\n\n### Caching strategies\n\nEffective caching can significantly improve performance.  Leverage browser caching to avoid repeatedly downloading the same application code. This includes:\n\n* **HTTP Caching Headers:**  Configure appropriate `Cache-Control` headers on your application's assets to set appropriate caching policies (e.g., max-age).\n\n* **Service Workers:** Implement a service worker to cache application assets offline and improve load times even when the user is offline.\n\n* **Bundler Caching:** Many bundlers provide caching mechanisms that can speed up subsequent builds.\n\n\n### Working with different build tools\n\nsingle-spa is compatible with various build tools like Webpack, Parcel, Rollup, and others.  The choice of build tool depends on your project's needs and preferences.  Each tool has its own mechanisms for code splitting, optimization, and caching.  It's crucial to configure your chosen build tool correctly to optimize your single-spa application.  Ensure your configuration leverages features like code splitting, minification, and appropriate caching strategies.\n\n\n### Performance considerations\n\nPerformance considerations are crucial for a successful single-spa architecture:\n\n* **Avoid blocking rendering:** Ensure your application loading doesn't block the rendering of the main page.  Properly handle asynchronous loading to avoid the dreaded \"white screen of death.\"\n\n* **Optimize application size:** Smaller application bundles lead to faster load times.  Optimize your code, images, and other assets to reduce their size.\n\n* **Measure and monitor performance:** Regularly measure performance metrics (e.g., load time, time to interactive, bundle size) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.  This helps identify areas for improvement.\n\n* **Efficient DOM manipulation:** In your `mount` and `unmount` functions, minimize unnecessary DOM manipulation.  Use techniques like virtual DOM (if applicable) to improve rendering performance.\n\n* **Resource management:**  Ensure your applications release resources (e.g., event listeners) properly in their `unmount` function to prevent memory leaks.\n\nBy focusing on these optimization strategies, you can build high-performing single-spa applications that provide a smooth user experience.\n\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### Using single-spa with different routing libraries\n\nsingle-spa's core routing mechanism is based on the browser's URL.  However, you can integrate single-spa with other routing libraries, such as React Router, Angular Router, or Vue Router, within your individual microfrontends.  single-spa itself doesn't dictate or interfere with the internal routing of your microfrontends.  The `activeWhen` function in `registerApplication` determines which microfrontend is active based on the URL, and the internal routing libraries handle navigation within each microfrontend.  You might need to adjust how you handle navigation within each microfrontend to ensure smooth transitions between different parts of your application.\n\n\n### Handling errors and exceptions\n\nRobust error handling is essential for a production-ready single-spa application.  You should implement error handling at multiple levels:\n\n* **During application loading:** Use try-catch blocks around your `import()` statements in the `app` function passed to `registerApplication` to handle errors that may occur while loading a microfrontend.  The `loadError` function can be used for more advanced handling.\n\n* **Within microfrontend lifecycles:** Handle errors within the `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` functions of your microfrontends using appropriate error handling mechanisms specific to your chosen framework.\n\n* **Global error handling:** Consider using a global error handler (e.g., `window.onerror`) to catch any unhandled exceptions that might occur within your single-spa application.\n\n\n### Integrating with other libraries and tools\n\nsingle-spa is designed to work well with various libraries and tools. You can integrate it with:\n\n* **State management libraries:**  Redux, Zustand, Vuex, or NgRx can be used within your individual microfrontends to manage their state.\n\n* **UI component libraries:**  React Bootstrap, Material-UI, Ant Design, etc., can be integrated into your microfrontends.\n\n* **Testing frameworks:**  Jest, Cypress, Mocha, etc., are compatible for testing your microfrontends and the overall single-spa application.\n\n* **Analytics and monitoring tools:**  Integrate tools like Google Analytics or other monitoring services to track application usage and performance.\n\nThe key is to ensure that these integrations are done within the individual microfrontends, keeping them independent and loosely coupled.\n\n\n### Testing your application\n\nTesting a single-spa application requires a multi-faceted approach:\n\n* **Unit tests:**  Test individual components and functions within each microfrontend using appropriate testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, etc.).\n\n* **Integration tests:** Test the interaction between different microfrontends. This often involves simulating URL changes and verifying that the correct microfrontends are activated and deactivated.  Libraries like `single-spa-react` provide helper functions for integration testing.\n\n* **End-to-end tests:** Test the entire application flow using tools like Cypress or Selenium.\n\n* **Performance tests:** Measure load times, bundle sizes, and other performance metrics to ensure optimal performance.\n\n\n### Debugging and troubleshooting\n\nDebugging a single-spa application can be challenging due to its distributed nature.  Useful techniques include:\n\n* **Browser developer tools:**  Use the browser's developer tools (Network tab, Console tab) to inspect network requests, check for errors, and monitor performance.\n\n* **Logging:** Add logging statements to your microfrontends to track their lifecycle events and identify potential issues.\n\n* **Source maps:**  Enable source maps during your build process to debug your code in the browser.\n\n* **Debuggers:** Use a debugger (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to step through your code and identify the root cause of errors.\n\n\n### Security considerations\n\nSecurity is paramount.  Consider the following:\n\n* **Input validation:**  Sanitize user inputs within your microfrontends to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n* **Authentication and authorization:**  Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to your applications.  Consider using a central authentication service.\n\n* **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to secure communication between the browser and your application.\n\n* **Regular security audits:**  Perform regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Migrating from other microfrontend approaches\n\nMigrating from other microfrontend approaches (e.g., iframes, manual JavaScript loading) to single-spa involves refactoring your existing code to fit the single-spa lifecycle model.  This includes creating the `bootstrap`, `mount`, and `unmount` functions for each of your applications, and configuring the single-spa router. The complexity depends on the existing architecture.  Start with a small, self-contained component, migrate it to single-spa, and gradually migrate the remaining components.\n\n\n### Building a single-spa application with a monorepo\n\nA monorepo (a single repository containing multiple projects) can simplify the development and management of a single-spa application.  Tools like Nx, Turborepo, or Lerna can help manage the monorepo.  The key is to configure your build process (e.g., using workspaces in Webpack or similar features in other build tools) to build each microfrontend independently within the monorepo.  This enables efficient dependency management and shared code between your microfrontends.\n\n\n## Community and Support\n\n### Contributing to single-spa\n\nWe welcome contributions to single-spa!
