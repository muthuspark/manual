## Getting Started

### Installation

Tooltipster can be installed via npm or yarn.  For npm, use the following command:

```bash
npm install tooltipster
```

For yarn, use:

```bash
yarn add tooltipster
```

Alternatively, you can include Tooltipster directly from a CDN.  Include the CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tooltipster@latest/dist/css/tooltipster.bundle.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tooltipster@latest/dist/js/tooltipster.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
(Remember to replace `"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tooltipster@latest/..."` with the actual CDN link if it changes).  Ensure the paths are correct for your project setup.


### Basic Usage

After installation,  initiate Tooltipster on any element with a class or ID.  The most basic usage involves selecting the target element and calling the `tooltipster()` method. This will create a tooltip with the element's `title` attribute as content.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('[data-tooltipster]').tooltipster();
});
```

This assumes your HTML includes elements like this:

```html
<span data-tooltipster="Tooltip text here">Hover over me</span>
```

The `data-tooltipster` attribute is optional; if omitted, it will attempt to use the `title` attribute instead. If you use `title` then ensure it doesn't display natively. Consider using CSS `title { display: none; }`


### Quick Examples

**Example 1: Basic Tooltip with Content from `title` attribute:**

```html
<p title="This is a tooltip">Hover over me</p>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('p').tooltipster();
  });
</script>
```
Remember to style `title { display: none; }` if needed.

**Example 2:  Custom Content:**

```html
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myButton').tooltipster({
      content: $('<span>This is custom content!</span>')
    });
  });
</script>
```

**Example 3:  Changing the Tooltip's Position:**

```html
<a id="myLink" href="#">Link</a>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myLink').tooltipster({
      position: 'bottom'
    });
  });
</script>
```

This will place the tooltip below the link. Other possible positions include `top`, `left`, `right`.  Refer to the full documentation for a complete list of options and advanced configurations.


## Configuration Options

### Content

The `content` option specifies the text or HTML content displayed in the tooltip.  It can be a string, a jQuery object, or a function.

* **String:**  Simple text content.  e.g., `content: 'This is a tooltip'`
* **jQuery Object:**  Allows for complex HTML structures. e.g., `content: $('<div>This is <strong>HTML</strong></div>')`
* **Function:** Dynamic content generation. The function receives the instance of the tooltipster as an argument and should return the content.  e.g., `content: function(instance){ return 'Dynamic content: ' + instance.options.contentAsHTML; }`


### Position

This option controls the tooltip's position relative to the target element.  Possible values include: `'top'`, `'top-left'`, `'top-right'`, `'bottom'`, `'bottom-left'`, `'bottom-right'`, `'left'`, `'left-top'`, `'left-bottom'`, `'right'`, `'right-top'`, `'right-bottom'`.  Defaults to `'top'`.


### Theme

The `theme` option allows you to customize the tooltip's appearance using pre-defined themes or custom CSS.  Tooltipster provides several built-in themes (e.g., `'tooltipster-default'`, `'tooltipster-shadow'`, etc.). You can also create your own custom theme by defining your own CSS classes.


### Animations

Tooltipster supports various animations for showing and hiding tooltips.  The `animation` option can be set to: `'fade'`, `'grow'`, `'swing'`, or `'none'`. You can also provide custom animation functions.


### Events

Tooltipster triggers various events throughout its lifecycle (e.g., `'show'`, `'shown'`, `'hide'`, `'hidden'`, `'update'`, `'creation'`). These events can be used to perform custom actions in response to tooltip events.


### Callbacks

Callbacks allow you to execute custom functions at specific points during the tooltip's lifecycle.  These include `onShow`, `onShown`, `onHide`, `onHidden`, `onUpdate`, `onContentReady`.  Each callback receives the tooltip instance as an argument.


### Distance

The `distance` option sets the spacing (in pixels) between the tooltip and the target element.  Defaults to 0.


### MaxWidth

The `maxWidth` option limits the tooltip's width (in pixels or percentage). This helps prevent tooltips from overflowing their container.


### Delay

The `delay` option controls the delay (in milliseconds) before the tooltip appears (or disappears).  It can be a single number for both show and hide delays, or an object with separate `show` and `hide` properties.


### Trigger

Specifies the event that triggers the tooltip's appearance.  Possible values: `'hover'`, `'click'`, `'custom'` (requires defining custom events), 'focus'. Defaults to 'hover'.


### AutoClose

The `autoClose` option controls whether the tooltip automatically closes when another tooltip is shown.  Set to `true` to enable this behavior (default).


### Multiple Tooltips

Tooltipster allows displaying multiple tooltips on a page simultaneously.  The configuration options directly control the behavior of each tooltip instance.


### Content Update

The `content` option can be updated dynamically after the tooltip is initialized, using the `update()` method. This allows for refreshing the tooltip's content based on changes in the application state.


### Accessibility

Tooltipster is designed with accessibility in mind.  By default it uses ARIA attributes to ensure proper screen reader compatibility.  You should ensure proper semantic HTML for your target elements to make sure screen readers work as expected.  Custom themes should also maintain accessibility best practices.



## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Themes

To create a custom theme, you'll need to define your own CSS classes.  Start by inspecting the default Tooltipster CSS to understand the structure and classes used. Then, create a new CSS file and define your custom styles targeting the relevant classes (e.g., `.tooltipster-base`, `.tooltipster-content`, `.tooltipster-arrow`).  Then, apply this custom theme using the `theme` option in your Tooltipster initialization:

```javascript
$('.my-element').tooltipster({
  theme: 'my-custom-theme'
});
```


### Using Templates

For more complex tooltip layouts, use templates. Create an HTML template element and set its ID. Then, reference this template ID in the Tooltipster configuration using the `template` option:

```html
<template id="myTooltipTemplate">
  <div class="my-custom-tooltip">
    <span class="tooltip-title"></span>
    <div class="tooltip-content"></div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  $('.my-element').tooltipster({
    template: '#myTooltipTemplate'
  });
</script>
```

You can then style this template using CSS to achieve your desired look.


### Handling Events

Tooltipster offers several events you can listen to and respond to using jQuery's `.on()` method:

```javascript
$('.my-element').on('tooltipster:show', function() {
  console.log('Tooltip is about to show!');
});

$('.my-element').on('tooltipster:shown', function(event, $tooltip) {
    // $tooltip is the tooltip's jQuery object
    console.log('Tooltip is shown:', $tooltip);
});

$('.my-element').on('tooltipster:hide', function() {
  console.log('Tooltip is about to hide!');
});

$('.my-element').on('tooltipster:hidden', function() {
  console.log('Tooltip is hidden!');
});
```

Consult the documentation for a full list of events.


### Integration with Other Libraries

Tooltipster should integrate well with most JavaScript libraries.  If conflicts arise, ensure proper initialization order, potentially wrapping Tooltipster initialization within a callback of the other library.


### Troubleshooting

If tooltips are not appearing, check the following:
* **Correct Initialization:**  Ensure Tooltipster is properly included and initialized on the target element(s).
* **CSS Conflicts:** Check for any CSS conflicts that might be hiding the tooltip. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the tooltip's styles.
* **jQuery Dependency:**  Make sure jQuery is included before Tooltipster.
* **Conflicting JavaScript:** Other scripts may interfere; test by temporarily disabling other plugins.
* **Incorrect Options:** Review the Tooltipster configuration options for any errors or misconfigurations.  Consult the console for any JavaScript errors.


### Performance Optimization

For a large number of tooltips, consider these optimizations:
* **Lazy Initialization:** Initialize tooltips only when they are needed (e.g., when the user interacts with an element). Use the `trigger` option to only show tooltips on hover or click rather than on page load.
* **Content Caching:** If the content is not dynamic, pre-compute it and store it for later use to avoid redundant calculations.
* **Reduce DOM Manipulation:**  Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations during tooltip creation and updates.


### Working with Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)

**React:**  Use Tooltipster within a React component's `useEffect` hook to initialize after the component renders.  Wrap the Tooltipster call to avoid conflicts with React's virtual DOM.

**Vue:**  Use Tooltipster within a Vue component's `mounted` lifecycle hook.  Consider using a custom directive to simplify the process.

**Angular:**  Use Tooltipster within an Angular component's `AfterViewInit` lifecycle hook.  You may need to use a custom directive or a service to manage Tooltipster initialization and cleanup.

Remember to handle the cleanup in the respective component's `componentWillUnmount` (React), `beforeDestroy` (Vue), or `ngOnDestroy` (Angular) lifecycle hooks to prevent memory leaks.  For more complex integrations, consult the specific framework's documentation for best practices on using third-party libraries.


## API Reference

### Tooltipster Instance Methods

Instance methods are called on a specific Tooltipster instance.  To get an instance, you can use the `tooltipster('instance')` method.

* **`destroy()`:**  Removes the tooltip and its associated event listeners.

* **`hide()`:**  Hides the tooltip.

* **`show()`:** Shows the tooltip.

* **`update(content)`:** Updates the tooltip's content. The `content` parameter can be a string or a jQuery object.


* **`option(optionName, value)`:** Gets or sets a specific option.  If only `optionName` is provided, it returns the current value of that option. If both `optionName` and `value` are provided, it sets the option to the new `value`.

* **`element()`:** Returns the jQuery object of the target element associated with the tooltip instance.

* **`content()`:** Returns the content of the tooltip.

* **`isOpen()`:** Returns a boolean indicating if the tooltip is currently visible.



### Tooltipster Static Methods

Static methods are called directly on the Tooltipster object itself.

* **`instances()`:** Returns an array containing all active Tooltipster instances.

* **`destroyAll()`:** Destroys all active Tooltipster instances.


### Event Handling

Tooltipster provides several custom events that you can listen for using jQuery's `.on()` method (or equivalent in other frameworks).  These events are triggered at various points in the tooltip's lifecycle.  Some key events include:

* `'tooltipster:show'`: Triggered just before the tooltip is shown.
* `'tooltipster:shown'`: Triggered after the tooltip has been shown.
* `'tooltipster:hide'`: Triggered just before the tooltip is hidden.
* `'tooltipster:hidden'`: Triggered after the tooltip has been hidden.
* `'tooltipster:update'`: Triggered after the tooltip content has been updated.
* `'tooltipster:creation'`: Triggered when the tooltip element is created


The event handler receives the event object as the first argument and, in some cases, additional arguments (e.g. the tooltip instance, the tooltip content).


### Data Attributes

Tooltipster supports several data attributes to configure tooltips directly in HTML.  These can be used as an alternative to configuring tooltips via JavaScript.  Some important data attributes include:

* `data-tooltipster`:  This is optional, but can specify the tooltip content if the element doesn't have a `title` attribute.

* `data-tooltipster-content`:  Specifies the content of the tooltip.


* `data-tooltipster-position`:  Sets the tooltip's position (e.g., `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`).

* `data-tooltipster-theme`:  Specifies the theme to use.

* `data-tooltipster-delay`:  Sets the delay before showing the tooltip (in milliseconds). Can be a single value (applied to both show and hide) or a comma separated pair of values (show,hide)


These data attributes provide a convenient way to configure simple tooltips directly in your HTML, while leaving more complex configurations to JavaScript.  Remember that JavaScript configuration will override any conflicting data attributes.


## Migration Guide

### From Older Versions

Migrating from older versions of Tooltipster to the latest version might require some adjustments depending on the version you're upgrading from.  Check the release notes for your specific version range to identify breaking changes.  Generally, the most significant changes between major versions are documented there.

However, here are some common areas to review when migrating:

* **Check for Deprecated Options or Methods:** Older versions may have deprecated options or methods that have been removed in the latest version.  Refer to the release notes and updated documentation for the latest options and their proper usage.  Replace any deprecated options or methods with their modern equivalents.

* **API Changes:** Minor API changes might occur between versions.  Review the API Reference section of the documentation to ensure your code is using the correct methods and parameters.

* **CSS Changes:** The CSS classes and structure might have undergone minor changes between versions.  Review any custom CSS you've written for your tooltips to ensure compatibility with the updated structure.  In case of theme customization, carefully compare the CSS classes from the older version with the newer version to ensure a smooth transition and avoid breaking changes.

* **Dependency Updates:** If you are managing your dependencies manually, ensure that you've updated Tooltipster to the latest version. If you are using a package manager like npm or yarn, run the update command to get the newest version.

* **Test Thoroughly:** After making the necessary changes, thoroughly test your application to ensure that all tooltips are functioning correctly and that there are no unexpected issues. Pay particular attention to cases that rely on custom configurations or event handlers.


It's recommended to start by updating to the nearest minor version (e.g., from v4.2 to v4.3, then v4.3 to v4.4, and so on) before finally upgrading to the latest major version. This incremental approach will make it easier to identify and resolve any migration issues.  Each release usually contains detailed information on breaking changes.  If you encounter any problems, consult the latest documentation and release notes, or seek support from the Tooltipster community.
