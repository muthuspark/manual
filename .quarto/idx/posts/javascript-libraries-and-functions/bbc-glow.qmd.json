Developers should ensure error messages clearly inform the user about the nature of the problem (e.g., \"No internet connection,\" \"Server unavailable\").  Strategies for handling intermittent connectivity, such as implementing buffering and caching mechanisms, should be employed.   The system should gracefully handle network interruptions and attempt to re-establish connection automatically when possible.   Clear instructions on troubleshooting network issues should be provided to users, including checking router settings, network cables, and Wi-Fi signal strength.\n\n### Playback Errors\n\nPlayback errors can stem from various issues, such as corrupted video files, incompatible codecs, or insufficient bandwidth.  The system should provide informative error messages to help users understand the nature of the problem.  Robust error logging is essential for developers to identify and address underlying issues.  Strategies for handling playback errors should include retry mechanisms, adaptive bitrate streaming, and fallback content options.  Error handling should prioritize user experience by providing options like resuming playback or suggesting alternative content.\n\n### Contacting BBC Glow Support\n\nDetailed instructions on how users can contact BBC Glow support should be provided.  This may include multiple channels such as:\n\n* **Email Support:**  Provide a dedicated support email address.\n* **Help Center/FAQ:** Link to a comprehensive help center with frequently asked questions and troubleshooting guides.\n* **Online Chat:**  Implement a live chat feature for immediate assistance (if feasible).\n* **Phone Support:**  Provide a phone number for users who require phone-based support (if available).\n\n\n### FAQ\n\nA frequently asked questions (FAQ) section should address common user inquiries.  This should be regularly updated to reflect any changes or updates to the BBC Glow service.  The FAQ should cover a broad range of topics, including account management, playback issues, content availability, and technical specifications.  The FAQ should be easily searchable and accessible to users through the app or website.  It should be written in clear, concise language, ensuring that information is easily understandable by a diverse user base.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Glossary of Terms\n\nThis glossary defines key terms used throughout the BBC Glow developer documentation.\n\n* **API:** Application Programming Interface; a set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.\n* **Bitrate:** The amount of data transmitted per unit of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps).
