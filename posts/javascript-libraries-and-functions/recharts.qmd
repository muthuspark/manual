## Getting Started

### Installation

Recharts can be easily installed using npm or yarn.  For npm, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install recharts
```

For yarn, use:

```bash
yarn add recharts
```

After installation, you'll need to import the necessary components into your project.


### Basic Example

This simple example demonstrates a basic line chart using Recharts:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend } from 'recharts';

const data = [
  { name: 'Page A', uv: 4000, pv: 2400, amt: 2400 },
  { name: 'Page B', uv: 3000, pv: 1398, amt: 2210 },
  { name: 'Page C', uv: 2000, pv: 9800, amt: 2290 },
  { name: 'Page D', uv: 2780, pv: 3908, amt: 2000 },
  { name: 'Page E', uv: 1890, pv: 4800, amt: 2181 },
  { name: 'Page F', uv: 2390, pv: 3800, amt: 2500 },
  { name: 'Page G', uv: 3490, pv: 4300, amt: 2100 },
];

const MyLineChart = () => {
  return (
    <LineChart width={500} height={300} data={data}>
      <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
      <XAxis dataKey="name" />
      <YAxis />
      <Tooltip />
      <Legend />
      <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#8884d8" />
      <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#82ca9d" />
    </LineChart>
  );
};

export default MyLineChart;
```

This code renders a line chart with two lines ("pv" and "uv"), an X-axis showing the page names, a Y-axis, a grid, a tooltip for data display, and a legend.  Remember to adjust the `width` and `height` properties to fit your layout.


### Import Statements

Recharts utilizes a component-based architecture.  You import the specific components you need, rather than importing the entire library.  Common imports include:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  LineChart, Line, BarChart, Bar, PieChart, Pie,
  XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend,
  RadialBar, RadialBarChart,
  // ... other components as needed
} from 'recharts';
```

This imports components for line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and their respective axes, grids, tooltips, and legends.  Consult the Recharts documentation for a complete list of available components.


### Understanding Components

Recharts components are structured hierarchically.  The top-level component, such as `<LineChart>`, `<BarChart>`, or `<PieChart>`, acts as a container for other components. These "child" components define the chart's axes, data representation, styling, and interactive elements.  For instance:

* **`<LineChart>`/`<BarChart>`/`<PieChart>`:**  The container component for the respective chart type.  Requires a `data` prop containing your chart data.
* **`<Line>`/`<Bar>`/`<Pie>`:** Represents the data series to be plotted.  Requires a `dataKey` prop specifying the data field to use.
* **`<XAxis>`/`<YAxis>`:** Defines the X and Y axes, including labels and scaling.  Often use a `dataKey` prop to specify the data field for axis labels.
* **`<CartesianGrid>`:** Adds a grid to the chart for better readability.
* **`<Tooltip>`:** Enables interactive tooltips displaying data on mouse hover.
* **`<Legend>`:** Displays a legend to identify different data series.

Each component offers various properties for customization (e.g., styling, data formatting, etc.). Refer to the Recharts documentation for detailed information on each component's properties and usage.


## Core Components

### LineChart

The `LineChart` component renders line charts, ideal for visualizing trends over time or across categories.  It requires a `data` prop, an array of objects, where each object represents a data point.  Key properties include:

* **`data` (required):** An array of objects, each representing a data point.  Each object should contain keys corresponding to the `dataKey` properties used in child `<Line>` components.
* **`width`:** The width of the chart.
* **`height`:** The height of the chart.
* **`margin`:** An object specifying margins (top, right, bottom, left).

Child components like `<Line>`, `<XAxis>`, `<YAxis>`, `<CartesianGrid>`, `<Tooltip>`, and `<Legend>` are used to customize the chart's appearance and interactivity.  Each `<Line>` component needs a `dataKey` prop specifying which data field to use for the line's Y-values.


### BarChart

The `BarChart` component renders bar charts, useful for comparing discrete values across categories. Similar to `LineChart`, it takes a `data` prop (array of objects) and offers properties for width, height, and margins.  Key differences lie in the child components used:

* **`<Bar>`:**  Instead of `<Line>`, use `<Bar>` to represent data.  Requires a `dataKey` prop.  Properties like `barSize`, `fill`, and `stackId` are crucial for customizing bar appearance and stacking.
* **`layout`:**  Sets the chart layout to "horizontal" or "vertical" (default).


### AreaChart

`AreaChart` is similar to `LineChart` but fills the area under the line, highlighting the cumulative value. It uses the same `data` prop and child components as `LineChart`, but with a `<Area>` component instead of `<Line>`.  `<Area>` shares similar properties to `<Line>`, including `dataKey`, `stroke`, and `fill`.


### ScatterChart

`ScatterChart` creates scatter plots showing the relationship between two variables. It uses a `data` prop and renders points based on the `dataKey` values in child `<Scatter>` components.  Each `<Scatter>` needs `dataKey` properties for both X and Y coordinates.


### PieChart

`PieChart` displays data as a pie chart, ideal for showing proportions or percentages. It takes a `data` prop and uses `<Pie>` components to define each pie slice.  The `<Pie>` component requires a `dataKey` for the slice's value and optionally a `nameKey` for labels.


### RadarChart

`RadarChart` renders radar charts (spider charts), showing multiple variables at different levels. It takes a `data` prop and utilizes `<Radar>` and `<PolarGrid>` components.  Data is structured differently than other charts, with each data point representing a value for a specific category along a radius.


### Treemap

`Treemap` displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles, with the size of each rectangle proportional to its value.  It requires a `data` prop in a hierarchical structure, often represented as nested objects or arrays.  The layout and appearance are governed by specific properties within the `Treemap` component itself and its child `<Treemap.Rectangle>` component.


### ComposedChart

`ComposedChart` allows combining different chart types within a single chart area.  This enables showing multiple data series using different chart representations, such as combining line and bar charts.  It uses a similar structure to other chart types but can include multiple child components like `<Line>`, `<Bar>`, `<Area>`, etc., to visualize various datasets simultaneously.  Proper use of `dataKey` properties and potentially `stackId` for stacking is crucial for clear representation.


## Cartesian Charts

### Axes

Recharts provides `XAxis` and `YAxis` components to define the axes of Cartesian charts (LineChart, BarChart, AreaChart, ScatterChart, ComposedChart). Key properties include:

* **`dataKey`:** Specifies the data field to use for axis labels and scaling.  This is crucial and connects the chart data to the axes.
* **`type`:**  Allows specifying the axis type (e.g., "number", "category").  The default is usually "number" but should be "category" for categorical data on the X-axis.
* **`domain`:**  Allows manually setting the axis range. Useful for controlling the scaling and preventing extreme values from distorting the chart.  Can be a fixed array `[min, max]` or a function that dynamically calculates the domain.
* **`tick`:**  An object or array configuring the ticks (labels) along the axis.  Properties include `fontSize`, `fill`, and `formatter` (a function for custom formatting).
* **`allowDecimals`:** Controls whether decimal values are allowed on the axis.


### CartesianGrid

`CartesianGrid` adds a grid to Cartesian charts, improving readability.  Key properties:

* **`stroke`:**  Sets the color of the grid lines.
* **`strokeDasharray`:** Specifies the dash pattern for the grid lines.  Useful for creating dotted or dashed lines instead of solid lines.
* **`horizontal` and `vertical`:** Boolean properties to enable or disable horizontal and vertical grid lines independently.


### Tooltip

`Tooltip` creates interactive tooltips that display detailed data on mouse hover.  Key features:

* **`content`:**  A function that renders the tooltip content.  Recharts provides default rendering but this allows full customization.  The function receives a `payload` object containing data for the hovered point.
* **`cursor`:**  Specifies the cursor style when hovering over the chart.
* **`wrapperStyle`:**  Allows styling the tooltip container.


### Legend

`Legend` displays a legend showing the data series and their corresponding colors or symbols.  Key properties:

* **`layout`:**  Controls the legend layout ("horizontal" or "vertical").
* **`align`:**  Controls legend alignment ("left", "right", "center").
* **`wrapperStyle`:**  Allows styling the legend container.
* **`payload`:**  (Often implicitly handled) Contains information about the data series, including names and colors.  Customization might require accessing this directly.


### ReferenceLines

`ReferenceLine` adds horizontal or vertical lines to a chart, highlighting specific data points or thresholds.  Key properties:

* **`x` or `y`:**  Specifies the x or y-coordinate of the reference line.
* **`stroke`:**  Sets the color of the reference line.
* **`strokeDasharray`:**  Specifies the dash pattern.
* **`label`:** Adds a label to the reference line.


### Brush

`Brush` adds a brushing and zooming functionality to the chart.  The user can select a region of the chart to zoom into, or brush across the data to highlight a specific interval. It requires careful integration with other components, often needing a `syncId` prop to coordinate zoom/brush between multiple charts.


### ResponsiveContainer

`ResponsiveContainer` makes charts responsive to their parent container's size.  It automatically adjusts the chart dimensions to fit the available space.  This is essential for creating charts that work well on different screen sizes.  Simply wrap your chart component inside a `ResponsiveContainer`.


## Polar Charts

### PolarGrid

`PolarGrid` is a fundamental component for polar charts (`RadarChart`, `RadialBarChart`, `RadialBar`). It renders the grid lines within the polar coordinate system. Key properties include:

* **`cx` and `cy`:** The center coordinates of the chart.  These usually default to the center of the chart area.
* **`innerRadius` and `outerRadius`:** Define the inner and outer radii of the grid. These control the visible area of the chart.
* **`polarAngles`:** Allows customizing the angles at which radial grid lines are drawn.
* **`polarRadius`:** Allows customizing the radial grid circles/lines.


### PolarAngleAxis

`PolarAngleAxis` renders the angle axis of polar charts.  This axis is typically used to represent categories or labels around the circumference of the chart.  Key properties include:

* **`dataKey`:**  Specifies which data field contains the categories or labels for the angle axis.
* **`cx` and `cy`:** The center coordinates (same as `PolarGrid`).
* **`outerRadius`:** Controls the position of the angle axis labels.  Adjust this to prevent label overlap.
* **`tick`:**  Similar to Cartesian axes, this configures tick properties (e.g., `fontSize`, `fill`, `formatter`).


### PolarRadiusAxis

`PolarRadiusAxis` renders the radius axis of polar charts.  This axis typically represents numerical values extending from the center outwards.  Key properties include:

* **`cx` and `cy`:** The center coordinates (same as `PolarGrid`).
* **`orientation`:** Usually defaults to `'left'` which means it draws on the left.
* **`domain`:**  Allows setting the numerical domain of the radius axis similar to the cartesian axes.
* **`tick`:** Configures tick properties.
* **`tickFormatter`:** Useful for formatting the numbers displayed along the radius.


### PolarNetwork

`PolarNetwork` is a component that is part of `RadarChart` for creating network-like connections between data points. Although it's not always directly used independently like other components, understanding its role within `RadarChart` is crucial.  It's responsible for connecting the data points on the radar chart with lines or arcs, visually highlighting the relationships between them.  Its configuration usually happens implicitly through the `Radar` component within the `RadarChart`.  Direct customization of `PolarNetwork` is less common than configuring the styling of the lines within the `<Radar>` component.



## Shapes and Components

### Line

The `<Line>` component renders a line in Cartesian charts (`LineChart`, `ComposedChart`). Key properties:

* **`type`:**  Specifies the line type (e.g., "monotone", "linear", "step").  This controls the line's curvature.
* **`dataKey`:** Specifies the data field used for the y-values of the line.
* **`dot`:**  An object to customize the appearance of dots at each data point.  Properties like `fill` and `stroke` control the dot's color and outline.  Setting `dot={false}` hides dots.
* **`stroke`:** Sets the line color.
* **`strokeWidth`:** Sets the line thickness.


### Area

`<Area>` renders an area chart in (`AreaChart`, `ComposedChart`). It's similar to `<Line>`, but fills the area under the line. Key properties:

* **`type`:** Specifies the area type (similar to `<Line>`).
* **`dataKey`:**  Specifies the data field for y-values.
* **`fill`:**  Specifies the fill color of the area.
* **`stroke`:** Specifies the outline color.
* **`strokeWidth`:** Sets the outline thickness.


### Bar

`<Bar>` renders bars in (`BarChart`, `ComposedChart`).  Key properties:

* **`dataKey`:** Specifies the data field for bar height (or width if `layout="horizontal"`).
* **`fill`:**  Sets the bar fill color.
* **`barSize`:**  Sets the width (or height) of the bar.  This is essential for controlling bar spacing.
* **`stackId`:**  Used for stacking bars on top of each other.  Bars with the same `stackId` will be stacked.
* **`layout`:**  Specifies whether the bars are vertical ("vertical", default) or horizontal ("horizontal").


### Scatter

`<Scatter>` renders points in `ScatterChart`.  Key properties:

* **`dataKeyX`:** Specifies the data field for the x-coordinate.
* **`dataKeyY`:** Specifies the data field for the y-coordinate.
* **`fill`:**  Sets the fill color of the point.
* **`shape`:**  Allows specifying custom shapes for the points (e.g., "circle", "square").


### Pie

`<Pie>` renders slices in `PieChart`.  Key properties:

* **`dataKey`:** Specifies the data field containing the value for each slice.
* **`nameKey`:** Specifies the data field containing the label for each slice.
* **`cx` and `cy`:** Center coordinates of the pie chart.
* **`innerRadius` and `outerRadius`:** Inner and outer radii of the pie.
* **`fill`:**  Sets the fill color of the slice (can be an array for multiple slices).


### Cell

`<Cell>` is a generic component used for individual data elements within charts. It's primarily used for styling individual bars, points, or areas.  Key properties:

* **`fill`:**  Sets the fill color of the cell.
* **`stroke`:** Sets the outline color.
* **`onClick` and `onMouseOver`:**  Event handlers for interaction.


### Rectangle

`<Rectangle>` draws a rectangle on the chart. This provides flexibility to add custom shapes beyond built-in chart elements.  Standard properties like `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `fill`, and `stroke` are used.


### Label

`<Label>` adds labels to charts, providing additional information.  Key properties:

* **`position`:** Specifies the label's position (e.g., "top", "bottom", "left", "right",  or coordinate values).
* **`value`:** The text content of the label.
* **`fill`:** Label color.


### Text

`<Text>` is a generic text component. Similar to Label but usually added more manually for detailed customization.


### Symbol

`<Symbol>` renders symbols in charts, usually small shapes marking points.  Similar to the dot in the `<Line>` component but with more flexibility.  It allows specifying a custom shape using a function that renders a path or SVG element.


## Data Handling and Customization

### Data Adapters

Recharts doesn't impose strict data structures.  However, its components expect data in specific formats.  Data adapters help transform your raw data into a format suitable for Recharts components.  While not explicitly provided as separate components, the process involves using JavaScript functions to map and restructure your data.  For instance, you might need to:

* **Restructure Objects:**  Transform your data objects to match the `dataKey` properties expected by chart components.
* **Handle Missing Data:**  Implement logic to handle missing data points, preventing chart errors or unexpected behavior.
* **Aggregate Data:** Group or summarize data before rendering, for instance to pre-calculate totals or averages for display.


### Customizing Tooltips

Recharts provides extensive tooltip customization through the `Tooltip` component's `content` prop. This prop accepts a function that receives a `payload` object containing data for the hovered element. You can create custom tooltip components or functions using this `payload` to render whatever information you need.  You might dynamically generate HTML, access specific data fields from the `payload`, and adjust the tooltip's layout to create informative and visually pleasing tooltips.


### Customizing Legends

Similar to tooltips, legends can be customized. While Recharts provides default legend rendering, you can adjust the legend's layout (`layout`, `align`), add custom icon shapes, and modify how the legend items are formatted using CSS or inline styles applied to the legend wrapper or individual legend items.  You might need to inspect the structure of the `payload` passed to the legend rendering function for precise control.


### Data Formatting

Data formatting is crucial for clear data presentation. Recharts offers several ways:

* **`tickFormatter` (Axes):**  Customizes how axis tick labels are displayed.  This function receives a numerical value and returns a formatted string.
* **Custom Functions:**  Use custom JavaScript functions to format data values before passing them to chart components.  This is essential for things like currency formatting, date formatting, or adding units.
* **`formatter` (Tooltips):**  Customize the display of values within tooltips.


### Handling Events

Recharts components emit various events (e.g., `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut`).  You can attach event handlers to these events to implement interactive features.  Common use cases include:

* **Highlighting Data Points:** Change the appearance of a data point when it's hovered over.
* **Drilling Down:**  Navigate to a detailed view when a data point is clicked.
* **Updating Other Chart Components:**  Synchronize changes across multiple charts.


### Animations

Recharts supports animations to improve the user experience.  Animations are enabled by default for many chart types, creating smooth transitions as data changes.  You can control animation properties such as duration, easing functions, and whether or not animations are used via props like `animationDuration` available in many components.  Turning off animations can be beneficial for performance with very large datasets.


## Advanced Concepts

### Composing Charts

Recharts excels at composing multiple charts. The `ComposedChart` component allows combining different chart types (e.g., line and bar charts) within a single chart area.  This requires careful consideration of data structures, ensuring consistent X-axis scales and appropriate use of `dataKey` properties to correctly map data series to the respective chart types.  You'll often leverage stacking (`stackId` prop) for visual clarity when combining multiple bar or area charts.  Proper use of legends and tooltips is critical for easily interpreting the combined data.


### Dynamic Updates

Updating charts dynamically is crucial for interactive applications. Recharts efficiently handles data updates through React's state management.  Changes to your component's state, which influences the chart's data prop, will trigger a re-render and update the chart's visualization.  This process is inherently optimized by React's virtual DOM, making updates efficient even with frequent changes.  However, for extremely high-frequency updates, consider implementing techniques to reduce unnecessary re-renders, potentially using `useMemo` or `useCallback` hooks.


### Custom Components

Extend Recharts by creating custom components. This allows tailoring charts to specific needs. You can extend existing components or create entirely new ones, leveraging Recharts' underlying SVG rendering capabilities.  Consider creating custom shapes, axes, or tooltips.  For example, you might build a custom component that overlays a specific shape based on particular data conditions or adds annotation. Remember to adhere to Recharts' component structure and prop conventions for seamless integration.


### Integrating with React

Recharts is a React component library, seamlessly integrating with React's lifecycle methods and state management systems.  Use React's state and hooks to manage chart data and trigger updates, leverage React's component structure for organization, and employ React's event handling mechanism for interactive features.  Familiarize yourself with React's best practices, such as using functional components and hooks, for optimal performance and code maintainability.


### Performance Optimization

Performance is key, particularly with large datasets. Optimize Recharts charts by:

* **Data Reduction:** Pre-process data to reduce the number of points rendered.  Techniques like downsampling or aggregation can significantly improve performance.
* **Animation Control:** Disable or customize animations (`animationDuration`) for very large datasets.
* **Lazy Loading:** Load and render only the visible portion of a chart when possible.
* **Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders:** Employ React's optimization techniques (e.g., `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`) to prevent redundant updates.


### Accessibility

Ensure Recharts charts are accessible.  This involves:

* **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes to describe chart elements.
* **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Provide alternative text for images and descriptions for charts.
* **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure charts are navigable using keyboard alone.
* **Color Contrast:** Choose colors with sufficient contrast for readability.
* **Sufficient Size:**  Ensure charts and text are large enough to be easily viewed.




## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

Several common issues arise when working with Recharts:

* **Incorrect Data Format:** Ensure your data is correctly structured to match the `dataKey` properties of the chart components.  Double-check that your data is an array of objects and that the keys in your data objects match the `dataKey` props used in components like `<Line>`, `<Bar>`, etc.
* **Missing or Incorrect Imports:** Verify that you've correctly imported all necessary components from `recharts`.  Typos in import statements are a frequent source of errors.
* **Axis Configuration Issues:** Incorrectly configured axes (e.g., incorrect `dataKey`, missing `type` specification, or inappropriate `domain` settings) can lead to charts not rendering correctly or showing unexpected data.
* **Conflicting Styles:** Ensure your CSS styles don't conflict with Recharts' default styles.  Use browser developer tools to inspect the rendered chart elements and identify any style conflicts.
* **Incorrect Prop Values:** Check the values of all props passed to Recharts components. Invalid prop values, especially for numerical properties like `width`, `height`, and `margin`, can lead to rendering errors.
* **Overlapping Elements:**  With complex charts, elements (like labels or tooltips) might overlap.  Adjust margins, `outerRadius`, and label positioning to prevent overlap.


### Debugging Tips

Effective debugging is crucial:

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the rendered chart elements, view the console for errors, and debug JavaScript code.
* **Console Logging:**  Strategically place `console.log` statements in your code to inspect the values of variables, particularly the data passed to Recharts components and the props of those components.  This helps identify data inconsistencies or incorrect property values.
* **Simplify the Chart:** If your chart is complex, try simplifying it to isolate the problem.  Remove unnecessary components or data points to determine whether a particular component or data attribute is the source of the issue.
* **Check the Recharts Documentation:**  The official Recharts documentation is your best resource for understanding component properties, usage examples, and potential issues.
* **Inspect the Rendered SVG:**  Sometimes, examining the rendered SVG code directly in the browser's developer tools can reveal inconsistencies in element positions, sizes, or attributes that are causing rendering problems.


### Error Handling

Recharts doesn't have built-in comprehensive error handling for invalid data or incorrect configurations.  The responsibility for handling errors lies primarily with the developer.   Best practices include:

* **Data Validation:**  Add data validation to your code before passing data to Recharts components.  Check for the presence of required fields, data type validity, and the overall structure of your data.
* **Conditional Rendering:** Use conditional rendering in your React components to prevent rendering the chart if the data is invalid or missing. This prevents errors from crashing the application.
* **Error Boundaries (React):**  Wrap your Recharts components within React error boundaries to catch and handle rendering errors gracefully.  This prevents the entire application from crashing if a chart fails to render correctly.
* **Logging Errors:** Implement logging to capture and report errors, potentially sending them to an error tracking service for analysis.  This is helpful for identifying recurring issues in your chart rendering.




## API Reference

### Component Props

This section provides a comprehensive list of props for each Recharts component.  Due to the extensive number of components and their properties, a complete listing here is impractical.  However, the following outlines the general approach to understanding component props:

Each component's documentation (typically found on the official Recharts website or through JSDoc comments in the source code) details its specific props.  Props are generally categorized as follows:

* **Data Props:** These props define the data used to render the chart (e.g., `data`, `dataKey`, `dataKeyX`, `dataKeyY`).  Understanding these is fundamental to connecting your data to the visualization.
* **Structural Props:** These props control the layout and structure of the chart (e.g., `width`, `height`, `margin`, `cx`, `cy`, `innerRadius`, `outerRadius`).  These determine the size and position of chart elements.
* **Style Props:**  These props control the visual appearance of the chart (e.g., `stroke`, `strokeWidth`, `fill`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `strokeDasharray`). These are essential for customization of colors, line styles, font characteristics, etc.
* **Interactive Props:** These props enable interactivity (e.g., `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`). These allow developers to add custom behaviors to chart elements based on user interactions.
* **Axis-Specific Props:**  Axes (`XAxis`, `YAxis`, `PolarAngleAxis`, `PolarRadiusAxis`) have props for configuring tick marks, labels, domains, and other axis-related properties (`tick`, `dataKey`, `domain`, `type`, `allowDecimals`, `orientation`, `tickFormatter`).
* **Animation Props:** Some components offer props to control animation (e.g., `animationBegin`, `animationDuration`, `animationEasing`).


To find detailed information about the props for a specific component (e.g., `<LineChart>`), consult the Recharts documentation.  Look for the component's API reference, which will list all available props with descriptions and data types.


### Utility Functions

Recharts provides several utility functions to assist in chart creation and data manipulation.  These are not typically directly used as React components, but are helper functions which are called within your application code.  Again, a complete list is impractical here; the details of available utility functions are best found in the Recharts documentation.  However, you can generally expect functions related to:

* **Data Transformation:** Functions to help preprocess or restructure your data into a format suitable for Recharts.
* **Color Management:** Functions to generate or manage color scales for charts.
* **Coordinate Transformations:**  Functions for handling conversions between different coordinate systems.
* **Shape Generation:** Utility functions to generate specific shapes or SVG paths.
* **Data Calculation:** Helper functions for calculating statistical measures or other data transformations needed for chart visualization.

The documentation will provide examples and descriptions of how to utilize these utility functions effectively.  Remember to check the official documentation for the most up-to-date information on available utility functions and their usage.
