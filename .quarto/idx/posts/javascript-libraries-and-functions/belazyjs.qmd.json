This means images are only loaded when they are about to become visible in the user's viewport, improving initial page load times and overall website performance.  It's particularly useful for websites with many images, especially large ones, where loading everything upfront can significantly impact the user experience. Belazy.js handles the complexities of intersection observer API, providing a simple and efficient solution for lazy loading.\n\n\n### Why use Belazy.js?\n\n* **Improved Performance:**  Faster initial page load times lead to better user experience and higher search engine rankings.  Lazy loading significantly reduces the initial amount of data that needs to be downloaded.\n\n* **Enhanced User Experience:**  Users see content faster, avoiding long loading screens while the page loads all its images. This improves user engagement and reduces bounce rates.\n\n* **Reduced Bandwidth Consumption:** Only necessary images are loaded, saving bandwidth for both the user and the server.\n\n* **Easy Implementation:** Belazy.js is designed to be simple to integrate into existing projects with minimal code.\n\n* **Lightweight:** The library itself is small, adding minimal overhead to your website.\n\n\n### Setting up Belazy.js\n\n1. **Include the Library:** You can include Belazy.js via a CDN or by downloading the library and including it locally.  The CDN method is generally easier:\n\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/belazy.js@latest/dist/belazy.min.js\"></script> \n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize (Optional):** While Belazy.js automatically selects elements with the `data-belazy` attribute, you can optionally initialize it manually for more control. This is useful if you have specific initialization requirements or want to control the lazy loading process further. See the Advanced Usage section for details.\n\n\n### Basic Example\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use Belazy.js to lazy-load images:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Belazy.js Example</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/belazy.js@latest/dist/belazy.min.js\"></script> </head>\n<body>\n\n  <img data-belazy=\"images/image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\">\n  <img data-belazy=\"images/image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\">\n  <img data-belazy=\"images/image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\">\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `\"images/image1.jpg\"`, `\"images/image2.jpg\"`, and `\"images/image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.  Belazy.js will automatically detect the `data-belazy` attribute and lazy-load these images.  Remember to place your images in the specified directory.  No further JavaScript is needed for this basic setup.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nBelazy.js, being primarily focused on image lazy loading, doesn't inherently support concepts like component composition, data binding, or complex event handling and lifecycle methods in the way a full-fledged framework like React or Vue.js does.  Its core functionality is streamlined for its specific purpose.  However, we can discuss how these concepts *could* be applied in the context of using Belazy.js within a larger application that uses such frameworks.\n\n\n### Lazy Loading\n\nThis is the core function of Belazy.js.  It uses the Intersection Observer API to detect when an image element is within the viewport. When an image element with the `data-belazy` attribute is about to become visible, Belazy.js replaces the `data-belazy` attribute value (the image source URL) with the `src` attribute, triggering the image loading. This is handled entirely automatically by the library.  No further configuration is usually required beyond adding the `data-belazy` attribute to your `<img>` tags.  You can control the threshold for loading (how far from the viewport the image needs to be before loading) by using options (see advanced usage).\n\n\n### Component Composition\n\nBelazy.js itself doesn't have components. It operates at a lower level, focusing solely on lazy-loading images.  If you're using Belazy.js within a component-based framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.), you'd incorporate lazy loading into your components. For instance, in React you might have a component that renders an image, and within that component, you'd use Belazy.js by adding the `data-belazy` attribute to the `<img>` element rendered by your component.  The component's logic would be responsible for managing the data associated with the image URL.\n\n\n### Data Binding\n\nBelazy.js doesn't directly handle data binding.  Data binding is a feature of frameworks.  If your application uses a framework with data binding, the URL for the image passed to the `data-belazy` attribute would be dynamically updated via that framework's data binding mechanism. For instance, if your image URL is stored in a variable in your React component's state, changes to that state will automatically update the `data-belazy` attribute (assuming you are using a proper approach to update the DOM).\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nBelazy.js doesn't offer specific event handling mechanisms.  However, you can use standard JavaScript event listeners on the images to respond to events such as `load`, `error`, or `abort` after Belazy.js has triggered the image load.  These events are standard browser events and will fire normally once Belazy.js sets the `src` attribute. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst image = document.querySelector('img[data-belazy]');\nimage.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  console.log('Image loaded!');\n});\n```\n\n### Lifecycle Methods\n\nBelazy.js doesn't have lifecycle methods in the sense of component-based frameworks. The only implicit \"lifecycle\" is the loading of the image after it enters the viewport.  This is handled automatically by the library's internal use of the Intersection Observer API.  Any actions you want to take before or after an image loads would be done using standard JavaScript event listeners on the image element (as described in the Event Handling section).\n\n\n## Components\n\nBelazy.js is not a component-based framework; it's a single-purpose library for lazy-loading images.  The concepts of \"components,\"  \"component properties,\" \"component methods,\" \"component styling,\" \"component events,\" \"nested components,\" and \"component templates\" don't apply directly to Belazy.js itself.  Belazy.js works at a lower level, manipulating the DOM directly to achieve lazy loading.  If you're using Belazy.js within a component-based framework (like React, Vue, or Angular), then those concepts would be relevant within *that* framework, but not as features of Belazy.js itself.\n\n\n### Creating Components\n\nBelazy.js doesn't have a mechanism for creating components.  If you want to use Belazy.js within a larger application structure, you would create components within your chosen framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and integrate the lazy loading provided by Belazy.js within those components.  A component would typically render an `<img>` tag with the `data-belazy` attribute.\n\n\n### Component Properties, Component Methods, Component Events\n\nThese concepts are all relevant to component-based frameworks, not Belazy.js. For example, in React, you might have a component with properties defining the image source, methods to handle image loading state, and events emitted when the image loads or fails to load.  Belazy.js would simply be used within such components.\n\n\n### Component Styling\n\nStyling would be handled by your chosen framework's styling mechanism (CSS, styled-components, etc.) or within the CSS of your application. Belazy.js itself doesn't provide any features for styling images.  Any styling would be applied to the `<img>` element directly.\n\n\n### Nested Components\n\nIf using Belazy.js within a framework that supports nested components, you could nest components containing images with lazy loading as needed.  Belazy.js itself is agnostic to nesting.\n\n\n### Component Templates\n\nComponent templates (like JSX in React or templates in Vue) are part of component-based frameworks. Within the template for your component, you'd include the `<img>` tag with the `data-belazy` attribute to make use of Belazy.js.  Belazy.js doesn't have its own templating language.\n\n\n## Data Handling\n\nBelazy.js is solely focused on lazy-loading images.  It does not have built-in mechanisms for data binding, handling user input, working with forms, or data validation. These are features typically provided by JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.  If you're using Belazy.js within one of these frameworks, you would handle data within the context of that framework, and Belazy.js would simply be used for its lazy-loading functionality within those applications.  The examples below assume you are using a framework that provides the described features.\n\n\n### Data Binding with Expressions\n\nBelazy.js doesn't support expressions for data binding.  The `data-belazy` attribute expects a simple string representing the image URL.  If you are using a framework like Vue or React that supports data binding, you would bind the image URL to the `data-belazy` attribute using the framework's templating system and data binding mechanisms. For example in Vue:\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <img :data-belazy=\"imageUrl\" alt=\"My Image\">\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      imageUrl: 'path/to/image.jpg'\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n\n### Data Binding with Methods\n\nSimilarly, you can bind the `data-belazy` attribute to the return value of a method in your framework. This allows for more complex logic to determine the image URL.  However, Belazy.js itself is unaware of this data binding—it only uses the final string value of the `data-belazy` attribute.\n\n\n### Handling User Input\n\nUser input handling is done through the framework you're using, not Belazy.js. Event listeners (e.g., `onChange` in React or `v-on` in Vue) would be used to capture user input and update data used to control the image URL or other aspects of your application.  Belazy.js remains solely responsible for lazy loading.\n\n\n### Working with Forms\n\nForms are managed by your chosen framework. Belazy.js doesn't interact with form submission or form data processing.  Any data from forms that impacts the image URLs would be handled through the framework's data binding and event handling.\n\n\n### Data Validation\n\nData validation is performed within your framework, not by Belazy.js. You might use validation rules provided by your framework or external libraries to ensure that the image URL entered by a user (or generated by other parts of your app) is valid before it's used in the `data-belazy` attribute. Belazy.js doesn't perform any validation on the image URLs it receives.\n\n\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### Asynchronous Operations\n\nBelazy.js's core lazy-loading operation is inherently asynchronous.  The image loading is triggered only when the image is about to become visible, and the browser handles the image loading asynchronously in the background.  You can use standard JavaScript promises or async/await within your application's framework to handle any asynchronous actions related to the loading of the images (e.g., showing a loading indicator, processing the image data after it loads).  Belazy.js itself doesn't provide specific asynchronous API methods.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nError handling is done through standard JavaScript mechanisms. You can use the `onerror` event on the `<img>` tag to catch any errors during image loading. For instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst image = document.querySelector('img[data-belazy]');\nimage.onerror = function() {\n  console.error('Error loading image:', this.src);\n  // Add your error handling logic here, e.g., display a placeholder image.\n};\n```\n\nBelazy.js doesn't have specific error handling methods; it relies on the standard browser mechanisms.\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n* **Use Appropriate Image Sizes:**  Ensure your images are appropriately sized for their intended use.  Very large images can still impact performance even with lazy loading. Optimize image sizes using tools that compress images without significant quality loss.\n\n* **Image Formats:** Use efficient image formats like WebP where supported for better compression ratios.\n\n* **Minimize Reflows/Repaints:**  While Belazy.js itself is efficient, excessive DOM manipulations in your application could still impact performance. Optimize your application's general DOM manipulation for efficiency.\n\n* **Cache Busting:**  If you update your images frequently, implement proper cache-busting techniques to prevent browsers from serving outdated cached versions.\n\n\n### Testing Belazy.js Components\n\nSince Belazy.js is not a component framework itself, testing is done within the context of your chosen framework.  You'd typically test the integration of Belazy.js within your components by verifying that images are loaded only when they are visible, and that error handling functions correctly.  Use your framework's testing tools and utilities (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library for React applications).  Tests should focus on ensuring the image loading behavior within your components, not testing Belazy.js itself directly.\n\n\n### Integration with other libraries\n\nBelazy.js is designed to be compatible with other JavaScript libraries. There are no specific integration points to be aware of.  It's important to remember that Belazy.js interacts only with the DOM—specifically, it modifies `<img>` elements. As long as your other libraries don't interfere with this basic DOM manipulation, they should coexist with Belazy.js.  However, ensure that any libraries that also modify the DOM are used carefully to prevent conflicts.\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nBelazy.js has a minimal API surface.  It's primarily designed to be used declaratively by adding the `data-belazy` attribute to image tags.  There's no extensive API with global methods, component lifecycle methods, or utility functions in the same way as a full JavaScript framework.  The functionality is streamlined for its single purpose: lazy-loading images.\n\n\n### Global Methods\n\nBelazy.js does not expose any global methods.  Its functionality is triggered automatically by the presence of the `data-belazy` attribute on `<img>` elements.  Any manual control is typically handled through options passed during initialization (see advanced usage).\n\n\n### Component Lifecycle Methods\n\nBelazy.js does not have \"components\" or component lifecycle methods.  It operates at the DOM level.  If you are using Belazy.js within a component framework (React, Vue, etc.), your components will have their own lifecycle methods, but these are not directly related to Belazy.js.  You might use lifecycle methods in your framework to manage data related to image URLs before passing them to the `data-belazy` attribute.\n\n\n### Event Handlers\n\nBelazy.js doesn't provide its own custom events. You can utilize standard browser events such as `load`, `error`, and `abort` on the `<img>` elements to handle events related to image loading.  These events will fire after Belazy.js has triggered the image loading by setting the `src` attribute.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst image = document.querySelector('img[data-belazy]');\nimage.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  console.log('Image loaded!');\n});\nimage.addEventListener('error', () => {\n  console.error('Image load failed!');\n});\n```\n\n\n### Utility Functions\n\nBelazy.js does not expose any utility functions. Its functionality is contained within its core lazy-loading mechanism. Any utility functions you need for managing images or related tasks would be part of your application code or provided by external libraries used within your application, not part of Belazy.js itself.\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors\n\n* **Images not loading:** The most common reason is incorrect paths in the `data-belazy` attribute. Double-check that the paths to your images are correct relative to the HTML file. Also ensure that the images actually exist at the specified locations.  Network issues can also prevent images from loading; check your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to identify any network errors.\n\n* **Images loading too early/late:** This might indicate issues with viewport detection or the configuration of Belazy.js (if using advanced initialization options).  If images load too early, ensure that Belazy.js is correctly initialized and configured (or that it's not being called twice). If images load too late, you may need to adjust the thresholds in advanced configuration.\n\n* **JavaScript errors:** If you encounter JavaScript errors in the browser's console, examine the error messages for clues.  Common issues include syntax errors in your code or conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.  Make sure to properly include Belazy.js in your project.\n\n* **Conflicts with other libraries:** If you are using other libraries that manipulate the DOM, ensure they don't conflict with Belazy.js's operations.  Conflicts can usually be resolved by adjusting the order in which libraries are loaded or by carefully managing DOM manipulation.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:** The browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) are invaluable for debugging JavaScript issues.  The Console tab will show any JavaScript errors, and the Network tab can help identify network problems that prevent image loading.\n\n* **Inspect the DOM:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML and see if the `data-belazy` attribute is correctly set on your `<img>` tags and if the `src` attribute is correctly populated after the image is about to become visible.\n\n* **Simplify your code:** Isolate the problem by creating a minimal example.  Start with a very simple HTML file that includes only a few images and Belazy.js.  If the problem persists in the minimal example, the problem is likely with Belazy.js or a fundamental setup issue.\n\n* **Check for JavaScript conflicts:** Try temporarily disabling other JavaScript libraries to see if one is interfering with Belazy.js.\n\n\n### Helpful Resources\n\n* **Belazy.js (if available):** Check the official Belazy.js website or GitHub repository for documentation, examples, and potentially a support forum or issue tracker.\n\n* **MDN Web Docs:** The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides comprehensive documentation on web technologies, including JavaScript, the DOM, and the Intersection Observer API, which Belazy.js uses.\n\n* **Stack Overflow:**  Stack Overflow is a great resource for finding solutions to common JavaScript problems, including those related to image lazy loading.  Search for relevant keywords related to your issue.\n\n* **Your browser's developer tools documentation:**  The developer tools in your browser often have built-in documentation or help features.  These can provide detailed information on the tools and their usage.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Introduction to Belazy.js\n\n### What is Belazy.js?\n\nBelazy.js is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to lazy-load images.

It's primarily designed to be used declaratively by adding the `data-belazy` attribute to image tags.  There's no extensive API with global methods, component lifecycle methods, or utility functions in the same way as a full JavaScript framework.  The functionality is streamlined for its single purpose: lazy-loading images.\n\n\n### Global Methods\n\nBelazy.js does not expose any global methods.  Its functionality is triggered automatically by the presence of the `data-belazy` attribute on `<img>` elements.  Any manual control is typically handled through options passed during initialization (see advanced usage).\n\n\n### Component Lifecycle Methods\n\nBelazy.js does not have \"components\" or component lifecycle methods.  It operates at the DOM level.  If you are using Belazy.js within a component framework (React, Vue, etc.), your components will have their own lifecycle methods, but these are not directly related to Belazy.js.  You might use lifecycle methods in your framework to manage data related to image URLs before passing them to the `data-belazy` attribute.\n\n\n### Event Handlers\n\nBelazy.js doesn't provide its own custom events. You can utilize standard browser events such as `load`, `error`, and `abort` on the `<img>` elements to handle events related to image loading.  These events will fire after Belazy.js has triggered the image loading by setting the `src` attribute.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst image = document.querySelector('img[data-belazy]');\nimage.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  console.log('Image loaded!');\n});\nimage.addEventListener('error', () => {\n  console.error('Image load failed!');\n});\n```\n\n\n### Utility Functions\n\nBelazy.js does not expose any utility functions. Its functionality is contained within its core lazy-loading mechanism. Any utility functions you need for managing images or related tasks would be part of your application code or provided by external libraries used within your application, not part of Belazy.js itself.\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors\n\n* **Images not loading:** The most common reason is incorrect paths in the `data-belazy` attribute. Double-check that the paths to your images are correct relative to the HTML file. Also ensure that the images actually exist at the specified locations.  Network issues can also prevent images from loading; check your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to identify any network errors.\n\n* **Images loading too early/late:** This might indicate issues with viewport detection or the configuration of Belazy.js (if using advanced initialization options).  If images load too early, ensure that Belazy.js is correctly initialized and configured (or that it's not being called twice). If images load too late, you may need to adjust the thresholds in advanced configuration.\n\n* **JavaScript errors:** If you encounter JavaScript errors in the browser's console, examine the error messages for clues.  Common issues include syntax errors in your code or conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.  Make sure to properly include Belazy.js in your project.\n\n* **Conflicts with other libraries:** If you are using other libraries that manipulate the DOM, ensure they don't conflict with Belazy.js's operations.  Conflicts can usually be resolved by adjusting the order in which libraries are loaded or by carefully managing DOM manipulation.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:** The browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) are invaluable for debugging JavaScript issues.  The Console tab will show any JavaScript errors, and the Network tab can help identify network problems that prevent image loading.\n\n* **Inspect the DOM:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML and see if the `data-belazy` attribute is correctly set on your `<img>` tags and if the `src` attribute is correctly populated after the image is about to become visible.\n\n* **Simplify your code:** Isolate the problem by creating a minimal example.  Start with a very simple HTML file that includes only a few images and Belazy.js.  If the problem persists in the minimal example, the problem is likely with Belazy.js or a fundamental setup issue.\n\n* **Check for JavaScript conflicts:** Try temporarily disabling other JavaScript libraries to see if one is interfering with Belazy.js.\n\n\n### Helpful Resources\n\n* **Belazy.js (if available):** Check the official Belazy.js website or GitHub repository for documentation, examples, and potentially a support forum or issue tracker.\n\n* **MDN Web Docs:** The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides comprehensive documentation on web technologies, including JavaScript, the DOM, and the Intersection Observer API, which Belazy.js uses.\n\n* **Stack Overflow:**  Stack Overflow is a great resource for finding solutions to common JavaScript problems, including those related to image lazy loading.  Search for relevant keywords related to your issue.\n\n* **Your browser's developer tools documentation:**  The developer tools in your browser often have built-in documentation or help features.  These can provide detailed information on the tools and their usage.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
