## Introduction

### What is timeago?

Timeago is a lightweight JavaScript library that converts timestamps into user-friendly relative time phrases, such as "a few seconds ago," "3 hours ago," or "2 days ago."  It provides a simple and elegant way to display dates and times in a more human-readable format, improving the user experience by making time information easily understandable at a glance.  This is particularly useful for displaying recently updated content, news feeds, or activity logs.

### Key Features

* **Lightweight and efficient:** Timeago is designed to be small and fast, minimizing its impact on website performance.
* **Easy to use:**  The library offers a simple API for easy integration into your projects.
* **Customizable:** You can customize the language used, the format of the output strings, and the level of precision.
* **Multiple language support:**  Timeago supports numerous languages, allowing you to adapt it to your target audience.
* **Browser compatibility:** It works across major browsers ensuring broad reach.


### Installation

Timeago can be integrated into your project using various methods:

**1. Using a CDN:**

The easiest way is to include the library via a CDN. Add the following `<script>` tag to your HTML file's `<head>` section, replacing `[version]` with the desired version number (check the project's website for the latest version):

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/timeago.js/[version]/timeago.min.js"></script>
```

**2. Using npm:**

If you're using npm (Node Package Manager), you can install timeago via the command line:

```bash
npm install timeago.js
```

Then, you can import it into your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';
```

**3. Using yarn:**

Similar to npm, if you're using yarn, you can install it with:

```bash
yarn add timeago.js
```

And import it into your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';
```

After installation (using any of the above methods), you'll be ready to use the Timeago API in your application.  Refer to the API documentation for specific usage instructions.


## Basic Usage

### Rendering Timeago in HTML

The simplest way to use Timeago is by adding a `data-timeago` attribute to your HTML element containing a timestamp.  Timeago will automatically detect and process these elements when the page loads.  The timestamp should be in a format that JavaScript's `Date.parse()` function can understand (e.g., ISO 8601 format, or a Unix timestamp).

```html
<time datetime="2024-03-08T12:00:00Z" data-timeago></time>
```

This will render as a relative time phrase like "a few seconds ago" (if the current time is close to the timestamp) or "3 months ago," etc., automatically updating periodically.


### Using the timeago Function

For more programmatic control, use the `timeago` function directly.  This allows you to format timestamps in your JavaScript code and inject the resulting relative time strings into your HTML.

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';

const timestamp = new Date(); // Or a specific timestamp: new Date('2024-03-08T12:00:00Z');
const relativeTime = timeago.format(timestamp);

// Inject the relative time into an HTML element
const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
element.textContent = relativeTime;
```

This approach gives you greater flexibility, especially when dealing with dynamically generated content or needing more complex integration.  Remember to replace `'myElement'` with the ID of your target HTML element.


### Supported Languages

Timeago offers support for a wide range of languages.  To use a language other than the default (usually English), you need to specify the locale using the `locale` option.

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';

const relativeTime = timeago.format(timestamp, 'es'); // 'es' for Spanish, 'fr' for French, etc.
```

Consult the Timeago documentation or the library's source code for a complete list of supported locales.  You can also refer to the `languages` folder within the source code.


### Custom Language Support

If your desired language isn't supported, you can add custom language support by creating a new locale file. The structure of this file should follow the pattern established in the existing locale files.  Essentially, you need to define a function that maps time differences to appropriate language-specific strings.  The library's documentation or example locale files provide detailed instructions on the file structure and required functions.  After adding your custom locale, you can use it just like any other supported language:

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';
// Assuming you've added your custom locale 'myLang'
const relativeTime = timeago.format(timestamp, 'myLang');
```

Remember to include the new locale file in your project and adjust your importing mechanism accordingly.


## Configuration Options

### Locale Settings

Timeago allows you to easily change the language used for relative time phrases. This is done by setting the `locale` option.  The locale code should correspond to the language file included in or added to the library.  For example:

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';

timeago.render(document.querySelectorAll('time'), { locale: 'es' }); // For Spanish
```

If no `locale` is specified, the default locale (usually English) is used.  To see the available locales, refer to the Timeago's documentation or examine the available language files within the library's source code.  You can also easily add support for your own languages, as described in the Custom Language Support section.

### Custom Units

By default, Timeago uses standard units like seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. You can customize this by providing a `customUnits` object, which should map unit names to functions that return the number of milliseconds in that unit.

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';

const customUnits = {
  fortnight: () => 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // milliseconds in a fortnight
};

timeago.format(timestamp, null, { customUnits });
```

This example adds a "fortnight" unit to the available units. This approach enables you to include units tailored to your specific application requirements.

### Time Formatting

While Timeago automatically handles the relative time phrasing, you can further customize the output format by overriding the functions within each language's locale file.  This offers granular control over the exact phrasing used for different time differences. To fully control the formatting, you would need to modify or create a custom language file with modified functions. Consult the example locale files for guidance on the structure and available functions within the locale object.



### Refresh Interval

By default, Timeago updates the displayed relative time periodically to reflect the passage of time. You can control the frequency of these updates using the `refreshMillis` option.  This option sets the interval in milliseconds between updates.  Setting it to `0` disables automatic updates.

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';

timeago.render(document.querySelectorAll('time'), { refreshMillis: 60000 }); // Update every 60 seconds (1 minute)
```

Setting a refresh interval is crucial for balancing the accuracy of the relative time displayed and resource usage.  Adjust this value according to your application's needs.  A shorter interval provides more up-to-date information but uses more resources.  A longer interval conserves resources but may show less up-to-date information.


## Advanced Usage

### Working with Dates

Timeago accepts various date formats as input.  While it generally works well with ISO 8601 formatted strings and Unix timestamps (milliseconds since the epoch), you can use any date object that JavaScript's `Date.parse()` function can handle.  However, for optimal reliability and consistency, it's best practice to use ISO 8601 format whenever possible, as it avoids ambiguities associated with other date representations.  If you are working with a string representation of a date, ensure it's in a format parsable by the `Date` object.  If parsing fails, the library might not produce the expected result.

```javascript
import timeago from 'timeago.js';

// Using ISO 8601 string
let isoDateString = "2024-10-27T10:30:00Z";
let relativeTime = timeago.format(isoDateString);

//Using a Javascript Date object
let jsDate = new Date();
relativeTime = timeago.format(jsDate);


//Using a Unix timestamp (milliseconds)
let unixTimestamp = 1703750600000; // Example timestamp
relativeTime = timeago.format(unixTimestamp);

console.log(relativeTime);
```

Remember to handle potential errors during date parsing in your application.


### Handling Different Time Zones

Timeago primarily works with the user's local time zone. The timestamp you provide to the `timeago` function is interpreted as a UTC timestamp unless it explicitly includes timezone information (e.g., using the `Z` suffix for UTC or specifying an offset such as '+02:00'). If your application needs to handle different time zones consistently, ensure you provide timestamps with explicit timezone information according to the standards used within your application (e.g., consistently using UTC for all timestamps).  The library itself doesn't directly handle time zone conversions; that responsibility lies with your application's back-end or data processing logic.

### Integration with Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)

Timeago's integration with popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue typically involves using the library within the component's lifecycle methods or directives.

* **React:** You can use the `timeago` function within a functional component or lifecycle method of a class component.  You might also consider using a custom React hook for better code organization and reusability.

* **Angular:**  Use the `timeago` function within Angular's template or a component's logic. You could create a custom pipe to handle the timeago formatting in the template.

* **Vue:**  You can utilize the `timeago` function within a Vue component's computed properties or methods, or create a custom directive for cleaner integration.

The specific implementation will depend on your framework's conventions and your project's structure.  In most cases, you'll need to obtain the timestamp (potentially from props or component state) and then use `timeago.format()` to render the relative time.


### Server-Side Rendering

For server-side rendering (SSR), you have several options:

1. **Pre-rendering:** Calculate the relative time on the server before sending the HTML to the client.  This approach is simple but requires updating the relative time on the client-side after the page loads (to account for the time elapsed since rendering).

2. **Client-side rendering:**  Include the Timeago library in your client-side code, and render the relative time using JavaScript after the page has loaded on the client.  This avoids the need for server-side time calculations but increases the load time slightly.

3. **Hybrid approach:**  Perform a partial server-side rendering, including a placeholder or initial relative time, and then updating the time on the client side with JavaScript after the full page load to enhance the user experience with minimal initial load time.


The best approach depends on your application's architecture, performance requirements, and complexity.  Consider factors such as the frequency of content updates and the potential latency involved in client-side updates when making your decision.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

* **"Uncaught ReferenceError: timeago is not defined":** This error occurs when the Timeago library hasn't been properly included in your project. Double-check that you've correctly added the `<script>` tag (if using a CDN) or that you've correctly imported the library using npm or yarn and that the import path is correct.

* **Incorrect relative time displayed:** This might be due to several reasons:
    * **Incorrect timestamp format:** Ensure your timestamp is in a format that JavaScript's `Date.parse()` function can understand (e.g., ISO 8601, Unix timestamp).  Invalid dates will lead to unexpected results.
    * **Incorrect locale:** Verify that the locale you specified is correct and that the corresponding language file is included.
    * **Time zone issues:** If you're working with dates that include time zone information, ensure that the time zone is handled correctly in your application's logic.  Timeago primarily works with the user's local time.
    * **Cached results:** If you're seeing outdated relative times, clear your browser cache or try disabling caching to ensure you're receiving the latest version of the library and your updated timestamps are used.

* **`timeago` function is undefined:**  This error arises when you try to use the `timeago` function directly without properly importing or including the library. Make sure the `import` or `<script>` is correctly placed and the code referencing `timeago` is executed after the library has been loaded.



### Debugging Tips

* **Inspect the timestamp:**  Use your browser's developer tools to examine the actual timestamp being passed to the `timeago` function.  This helps you verify that the timestamp is correctly formatted and that the value is what you expect.

* **Check the console:** The browser's console often provides error messages that can pinpoint the source of problems. Pay close attention to any errors related to the Timeago library or date parsing.

* **Simplify your code:** To isolate the problem, try using a minimal example with a known good timestamp. If the minimal example works, gradually reintroduce more complex parts of your code to identify the source of the error.

* **Test with different browsers:** Test your code in multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

* **Inspect the Network tab:** Ensure that the library is loading correctly by checking your browser's Network tab to confirm that the library file is being downloaded and has the correct status code (e.g., 200 OK).


### Known Issues

Timeago is a relatively stable library, but like any software, it might have some edge cases or limitations.  Refer to the project's issue tracker or documentation for a list of known issues and their potential workarounds. The project's issue tracker or Github repository (if applicable) will often contain information about known bugs, reported problems and updates to the library.  It is always best practice to check the official repository for the most recent information on bug fixes and potential issues that are actively being addressed.


## API Reference

### timeago Function Details

The core of the Timeago library is the `timeago.format()` function.  It takes a timestamp and optionally a locale code and configuration object as arguments.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
timeago.format(timestamp, [locale], [options])
```

**Parameters:**

* `timestamp`:  This is the main parameter. It can be one of the following:
    * A `Date` object representing the point in time.
    * A string representing the timestamp in a format parsable by `Date.parse()`.  ISO 8601 format is recommended.
    * A numeric timestamp representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

* `locale` (optional): A string representing the language code (e.g., `'en'`, `'es'`, `'fr'`). If omitted, the default locale is used.

* `options` (optional): An object containing configuration options:
    * `customUnits`: An object defining custom time units (see Configuration Options Details).
    * `refreshMillis`: The refresh interval in milliseconds for automatically updating relative times (see Configuration Options Details).


**Return Value:**

A string representing the relative time phrase.  For example, "a few seconds ago", "3 hours ago", or "2 days ago".


### Language Locale Objects

Each language supported by Timeago is represented by a locale object. These objects are typically defined in separate files (e.g., `en.js`, `es.js`, `fr.js`) within the Timeago library or in custom locales.  The structure of these objects usually involves functions to format relative time, each handling a specific time range (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.). For details on the exact structure and functions, refer to the provided locale files included with the library or in your installation. They typically have a structure such as (this can differ slightly between versions):

```javascript
{
  numbers: {
      // ...
  },
  past: function (number, suffix) {
      // Function to format past relative times
  },
  future: function(number, suffix) {
      // Function to format future relative times
  },
  // ... other functions and properties
}
```

The exact keys and functions will depend on the language and the version of the Timeago library you are using.


### Configuration Options Details

The `options` object allows further customization of the `timeago.format()` function:

* **`customUnits`:** An object that defines custom time units.  The keys are the names of the custom units, and the values are functions that return the number of milliseconds in that unit.  For example:

```javascript
const customUnits = {
  fortnight: () => 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // milliseconds in a fortnight
  decade: () => 10 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // milliseconds in a decade
};
```

* **`refreshMillis`:** A number representing the interval in milliseconds at which the relative time is automatically updated.  A value of `0` disables automatic updates.  For example:

```javascript
const options = { refreshMillis: 60000 }; // Update every minute
```

These options are applied only to the specific `timeago.format()` call they are passed to.  They do not globally affect the library's behavior for all subsequent calls unless used in conjunction with other API calls that apply the options more widely (such as `timeago.render()`).  Consult the documentation for your specific version of the Timeago library for details on broader configuration settings if available.
