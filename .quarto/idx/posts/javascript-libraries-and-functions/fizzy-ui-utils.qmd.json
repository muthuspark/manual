Most components accept props that allow you to modify their behavior and appearance.  For example, you can change the color, size, and other attributes of a button by passing appropriate props.  Beyond props,  some components may allow for custom children to be rendered within them, offering a high degree of flexibility in how they are presented. Refer to the individual component documentation for specific customization options.  In cases where the provided props aren't sufficient,  consider extending the components or creating custom wrappers to achieve your desired customization.\n\n\n### Theming and Styling\n\nFizzy UI Utils employs a CSS-in-JS approach (or a similar method depending on the framework) to manage styles.  This allows for theming and easy style overrides. You can customize the overall look and feel of the components by modifying CSS variables or using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to create custom themes.  The library might provide mechanisms (e.g., a theme provider component) to easily switch between different themes.  Documentation should detail the specific CSS variables to target and how to create and apply custom themes.\n\n\n### Using with React\n\nTo use Fizzy UI Utils with React, you'll typically install the library via npm or yarn and then import and use the components in your React components as you would any other React component.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Button variant=\"primary\">Click Me</Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nMake sure the library's export structure is compatible with your chosen React version.\n\n\n### Using with Vue\n\nFor Vue.js integration, Fizzy UI Utils might provide Vue-specific components or wrappers. This could involve using a component library like Vue CLI or a dedicated installation process.  The components would then be registered and used within your Vue templates.  Refer to the library's Vue integration instructions for specifics. Example (Illustrative):\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <Button variant=\"primary\" @click=\"handleClick\">Click Me</Button>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils-vue'; // Vue specific package\n\nexport default {\n  components: { Button },\n  methods: {\n    handleClick() {\n      // Your logic\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\n\n### Using with Angular\n\nIntegrating with Angular might involve creating custom Angular components that wrap the Fizzy UI Utils components, or it could involve providing Angular-specific modules or components directly within the library.  The integration steps will be detailed in the documentation, but will likely involve importing and using the components within your Angular templates and components.  This might require specific configuration within your Angular project's `angular.json` file or module imports.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nFizzy UI Utils prioritizes accessibility.  Components are built to adhere to WCAG guidelines where applicable.  This includes using appropriate ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.  Developers should still ensure proper usage of components and potentially apply additional accessibility enhancements depending on context and specific user needs.  The documentation will outline accessibility features and best practices for using the components accessibly.\n\n\n### Internationalization and Localization\n\nTo support internationalization and localization (i18n/l10n), the library may provide mechanisms to easily translate text within components.  This might involve using a translation library (e.g., i18next) or a custom approach.  The documentation will guide you on how to integrate your preferred internationalization solution with Fizzy UI Utils to handle different languages and locales effectively.  This often involves providing localized text strings as props to components or using a context-based approach for managing translations across the application.\n\n\n## Utilities\n\n### DOM Manipulation Utilities\n\nFizzy UI Utils provides a set of utility functions for efficient DOM manipulation. These functions help simplify common DOM operations, reducing the need for manual DOM traversal and manipulation.  The functions are designed to be safe and efficient, minimizing potential performance issues.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `getElement(selector):` Retrieves a DOM element based on a CSS selector.  Handles edge cases like selectors not found gracefully.\n* `addClass(element, className):` Adds a CSS class to a DOM element.  Handles potential errors (e.g., element not found).\n* `removeClass(element, className):` Removes a CSS class from a DOM element.  Handles potential errors.\n* `toggleClass(element, className):` Toggles a CSS class on a DOM element (adds if not present, removes if present).  Handles potential errors.\n* `createEl(tagName, attributes, children):` Creates a new DOM element with specified tag name, attributes, and children.\n\n\nThe specific functions available and their exact signatures will be documented in the API reference.  These utility functions aim to make DOM interactions cleaner and less error-prone.\n\n\n### Event Handling Utilities\n\nThese utilities simplify event handling, providing more robust and maintainable event management compared to traditional `addEventListener` approaches.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `on(element, eventName, handler):` Attaches an event listener to a DOM element.  This may include features like automatic event cleanup (e.g., removing the listener when the element is removed from the DOM or the component unmounts, if used within a framework context).\n* `off(element, eventName, handler):` Removes an event listener from a DOM element.  Should handle potential errors, such as the listener not being present.\n* `triggerEvent(element, eventName, data):`  Programmatically triggers a specific event on a DOM element, allowing for testing and other scenarios where you want to simulate user interactions.\n\n\nThe API reference will detail the available functions and their parameters.  These utility functions offer improvements over native event handling, such as better memory management and improved error handling.\n\n\n### Animation Utilities\n\nFizzy UI Utils may provide functions for common animations, making it easier to add visually appealing transitions and effects to your UI components without needing to write animation logic from scratch.  These utilities might abstract away the complexities of animation libraries or provide simple helper functions.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `animateFadeIn(element, duration):` Adds a fade-in animation to a DOM element.\n* `animateFadeOut(element, duration):` Adds a fade-out animation to a DOM element.\n* `animateSlideIn(element, direction, duration):` Adds a slide-in animation from a specified direction.\n* `animateSlideOut(element, direction, duration):` Adds a slide-out animation to a specified direction.\n\n\nThe specific animation functions and their customization options will be detailed in the API documentation.  This section of utilities assists in creating smoother and more engaging user experiences.\n\n\n### Form Handling Utilities\n\nThese utilities streamline form handling, including validation and data submission.  They may help avoid boilerplate code associated with form manipulation.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `validateForm(formElement):` Validates a form element, returning an object indicating the validation status of each field.\n* `submitForm(formElement, url, method):` Submits a form using a specified URL and HTTP method.  Might handle common submission tasks like preventing default form submission behavior.\n* `getFieldValue(formElement, fieldName):` Retrieves the value of a specific form field.\n* `clearForm(formElement):` Clears the values of all fields in a form.\n\n\n\nThe full list of available form handling functions, their parameters, and return values are documented in the API reference.  These functions significantly improve the ease of implementing form validation and submission, reducing the amount of custom code required.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors and Solutions\n\nThis section lists common errors encountered when using Fizzy UI Utils and provides solutions.\n\n**Error:**  `Uncaught ReferenceError: FizzyUIUtils is not defined`\n\n**Solution:** This usually means the library hasn't been correctly imported or included in your project. Double-check your import statements (e.g., `import { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils';` in JavaScript or the equivalent in your framework) and ensure the `fizzy-ui-utils` package is correctly installed and accessible in your project's dependency tree.  Verify the package name is correct and the path to the library is accurate.\n\n\n**Error:**  Component renders incorrectly or doesn't display at all.\n\n**Solution:** This could have several causes:\n    * **Incorrect props:** Check that you are passing the correct props to the component and that the prop types match the component's expected input. Consult the component's documentation for details on required and optional props.\n    * **Conflicting CSS:**  Check for any CSS conflicts that might be overriding the component's styles. Inspect the rendered HTML and CSS using your browser's developer tools to identify conflicting styles. Use browser developer tools to inspect the component's styles and ensure they are being applied correctly. Consider using more specific CSS selectors to avoid unintended style overwrites.\n    * **Incorrect usage:** Ensure you are using the component correctly according to its documentation.  Review examples and usage guidelines to ensure you are following best practices.\n    * **Missing dependencies:** Check if the component has any dependencies that need to be included separately.  The component's documentation will list any external libraries it relies on.\n\n\n**Error:**  Runtime errors related to specific component functionality.\n\n**Solution:**  Examine the error message carefully.  It usually indicates the problematic line of code and the nature of the error.  Look at the component's documentation for details on potential issues related to that functionality.  Use logging statements (e.g., `console.log`) to inspect the values of variables and the state of the application at various points to determine the source of the error.\n\n\n\nMore specific error messages and their solutions will be added as they are encountered and reported.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to inspect the rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This helps identify style issues, incorrect DOM structure, and JavaScript errors.\n* **Console Logging:** Use `console.log` statements strategically to track the values of variables, the flow of execution, and to inspect data at different points in your code.  This is crucial for identifying problems within component logic.\n* **Source Maps:** When debugging, ensure that source maps are enabled. Source maps help link the compiled/minified code back to the original source code, making it easier to debug.\n* **Version Control:**  Utilize version control (Git) to track changes and revert to previous working versions if necessary. This is invaluable in case of errors introduced during development.\n* **Read the Documentation:** The documentation provides comprehensive information on component usage, prop types, and common issues.  Before posting an issue, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed the documentation.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n* **Minimize unnecessary re-renders:**  In framework-based applications (like React, Vue, or Angular), ensure that you are optimizing re-rendering to minimize unnecessary updates.  Use techniques like memoization and shouldComponentUpdate (React) or similar mechanisms to enhance performance.\n* **Lazy Loading:** For large applications, consider lazy loading components to improve initial load times and prevent the entire application from being rendered at once.\n* **Avoid excessive DOM manipulations:** Use the DOM manipulation utilities provided by Fizzy UI Utils efficiently to avoid unnecessary operations.\n* **Optimize images:** Use appropriately sized and optimized images to prevent performance issues related to large image files.\n* **Code Splitting:**  If the library supports it, utilize code splitting to load only necessary parts of the library on demand, which will reduce initial bundle size.\n* **Profiling Tools:** Use browser performance profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your application.  These tools can pinpoint areas where optimization is needed.\n\n\nBy following these suggestions, you can improve the performance and responsiveness of your application.  Further performance optimization techniques might be explained in the library's advanced usage documentation.\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides detailed information about the available components and utility functions within Fizzy UI Utils.

Styles are defined in the CSS.\n* `size`: (string, default: 'medium')  Sets the button size (e.g., 'small', 'medium', 'large').\n* `disabled`: (boolean, default: false) Disables the button.\n* `onClick`: (function)  A callback function triggered when the button is clicked.\n* `type`: (string, default: 'button') The button type (e.g., 'button', 'submit', 'reset').\n* `fullWidth`: (boolean, default: false) Makes the button fill its parent container's width.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<Button variant=\"primary\" onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>\n  Click Me\n</Button>\n```\n\n### Input Component\n\nThe Input component renders a standard text input field.\n\n**Props:**\n\n* `type`: (string, default: 'text') The input type (e.g., 'text', 'email', 'password', 'number').\n* `placeholder`: (string) Placeholder text for the input field.\n* `value`: (string) The current value of the input field.\n* `onChange`: (function) A callback function triggered when the input value changes.\n* `required`: (boolean, default: false) Makes the input field required.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<Input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Enter your email\" onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />\n```\n\n### Modal Component\n\nThe Modal component displays a dialog box overlaying the main content.\n\n**Props:**\n\n* `isOpen`: (boolean) Controls the visibility of the modal.\n* `onClose`: (function) A callback function triggered when the modal is closed.\n* `title`: (string) The title of the modal.\n* `children`: (node) The content to be displayed within the modal.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<Modal isOpen={isModalOpen} onClose={() => setIsModalOpen(false)} title=\"Confirmation\">\n  <p>Are you sure?</p>\n  <Button onClick={() => { /* Confirmation logic */ }}>Yes</Button>\n  <Button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(false)}>No</Button>\n</Modal>\n```\n\n### Dropdown Component\n\nThe Dropdown component provides a dropdown menu.\n\n**Props:**\n\n* `options`: (array) An array of objects, each with a `value` and `label` property.\n* `value`: (string) The currently selected value.\n* `onChange`: (function) A callback function triggered when the selection changes.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<Dropdown options={[{ value: 'option1', label: 'Option 1' }, { value: 'option2', label: 'Option 2' }]} onChange={(value) => setSelectedValue(value)} />\n```\n\n### Tooltip Component\n\nThe Tooltip component displays a small descriptive text box when hovering over an element.\n\n**Props:**\n\n* `text`: (string) The text to display in the tooltip.\n* `position`: (string, default: 'top') The tooltip's position relative to the target element (e.g., 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right').\n* `children`: (node) The element to which the tooltip is attached.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<Tooltip text=\"This is a tooltip\">\n  <span>Hover over me</span>\n</Tooltip>\n```\n\n### Progress Bar Component\n\nThe Progress Bar component displays the progress of a task.\n\n**Props:**\n\n* `value`: (number) The current progress value (0-100).\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<ProgressBar value={75} />\n```\n\n### Alert Component\n\nThe Alert component displays a message to the user.\n\n**Props:**\n\n* `type`: (string, default: 'info') The type of alert (e.g., 'info', 'success', 'warning', 'error').\n* `message`: (string) The message to display.\n* `onClose`: (function) A callback function to close the alert.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n<Alert type=\"success\" message=\"Operation completed successfully!\" onClose={() => setAlertVisible(false)}/>\n```\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Components\n\nFizzy UI Utils components are designed to be highly customizable.  Most components accept props that allow you to modify their behavior and appearance.  For example, you can change the color, size, and other attributes of a button by passing appropriate props.  Beyond props,  some components may allow for custom children to be rendered within them, offering a high degree of flexibility in how they are presented. Refer to the individual component documentation for specific customization options.  In cases where the provided props aren't sufficient,  consider extending the components or creating custom wrappers to achieve your desired customization.\n\n\n### Theming and Styling\n\nFizzy UI Utils employs a CSS-in-JS approach (or a similar method depending on the framework) to manage styles.  This allows for theming and easy style overrides. You can customize the overall look and feel of the components by modifying CSS variables or using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to create custom themes.  The library might provide mechanisms (e.g., a theme provider component) to easily switch between different themes.  Documentation should detail the specific CSS variables to target and how to create and apply custom themes.\n\n\n### Using with React\n\nTo use Fizzy UI Utils with React, you'll typically install the library via npm or yarn and then import and use the components in your React components as you would any other React component.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Button variant=\"primary\">Click Me</Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nMake sure the library's export structure is compatible with your chosen React version.\n\n\n### Using with Vue\n\nFor Vue.js integration, Fizzy UI Utils might provide Vue-specific components or wrappers. This could involve using a component library like Vue CLI or a dedicated installation process.  The components would then be registered and used within your Vue templates.  Refer to the library's Vue integration instructions for specifics. Example (Illustrative):\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <Button variant=\"primary\" @click=\"handleClick\">Click Me</Button>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils-vue'; // Vue specific package\n\nexport default {\n  components: { Button },\n  methods: {\n    handleClick() {\n      // Your logic\n    }\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\n\n### Using with Angular\n\nIntegrating with Angular might involve creating custom Angular components that wrap the Fizzy UI Utils components, or it could involve providing Angular-specific modules or components directly within the library.  The integration steps will be detailed in the documentation, but will likely involve importing and using the components within your Angular templates and components.  This might require specific configuration within your Angular project's `angular.json` file or module imports.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nFizzy UI Utils prioritizes accessibility.  Components are built to adhere to WCAG guidelines where applicable.  This includes using appropriate ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.  Developers should still ensure proper usage of components and potentially apply additional accessibility enhancements depending on context and specific user needs.  The documentation will outline accessibility features and best practices for using the components accessibly.\n\n\n### Internationalization and Localization\n\nTo support internationalization and localization (i18n/l10n), the library may provide mechanisms to easily translate text within components.  This might involve using a translation library (e.g., i18next) or a custom approach.  The documentation will guide you on how to integrate your preferred internationalization solution with Fizzy UI Utils to handle different languages and locales effectively.  This often involves providing localized text strings as props to components or using a context-based approach for managing translations across the application.\n\n\n## Utilities\n\n### DOM Manipulation Utilities\n\nFizzy UI Utils provides a set of utility functions for efficient DOM manipulation. These functions help simplify common DOM operations, reducing the need for manual DOM traversal and manipulation.  The functions are designed to be safe and efficient, minimizing potential performance issues.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `getElement(selector):` Retrieves a DOM element based on a CSS selector.  Handles edge cases like selectors not found gracefully.\n* `addClass(element, className):` Adds a CSS class to a DOM element.  Handles potential errors (e.g., element not found).\n* `removeClass(element, className):` Removes a CSS class from a DOM element.  Handles potential errors.\n* `toggleClass(element, className):` Toggles a CSS class on a DOM element (adds if not present, removes if present).  Handles potential errors.\n* `createEl(tagName, attributes, children):` Creates a new DOM element with specified tag name, attributes, and children.\n\n\nThe specific functions available and their exact signatures will be documented in the API reference.  These utility functions aim to make DOM interactions cleaner and less error-prone.\n\n\n### Event Handling Utilities\n\nThese utilities simplify event handling, providing more robust and maintainable event management compared to traditional `addEventListener` approaches.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `on(element, eventName, handler):` Attaches an event listener to a DOM element.  This may include features like automatic event cleanup (e.g., removing the listener when the element is removed from the DOM or the component unmounts, if used within a framework context).\n* `off(element, eventName, handler):` Removes an event listener from a DOM element.  Should handle potential errors, such as the listener not being present.\n* `triggerEvent(element, eventName, data):`  Programmatically triggers a specific event on a DOM element, allowing for testing and other scenarios where you want to simulate user interactions.\n\n\nThe API reference will detail the available functions and their parameters.  These utility functions offer improvements over native event handling, such as better memory management and improved error handling.\n\n\n### Animation Utilities\n\nFizzy UI Utils may provide functions for common animations, making it easier to add visually appealing transitions and effects to your UI components without needing to write animation logic from scratch.  These utilities might abstract away the complexities of animation libraries or provide simple helper functions.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `animateFadeIn(element, duration):` Adds a fade-in animation to a DOM element.\n* `animateFadeOut(element, duration):` Adds a fade-out animation to a DOM element.\n* `animateSlideIn(element, direction, duration):` Adds a slide-in animation from a specified direction.\n* `animateSlideOut(element, direction, duration):` Adds a slide-out animation to a specified direction.\n\n\nThe specific animation functions and their customization options will be detailed in the API documentation.  This section of utilities assists in creating smoother and more engaging user experiences.\n\n\n### Form Handling Utilities\n\nThese utilities streamline form handling, including validation and data submission.  They may help avoid boilerplate code associated with form manipulation.\n\n**Example functions (Illustrative):**\n\n* `validateForm(formElement):` Validates a form element, returning an object indicating the validation status of each field.\n* `submitForm(formElement, url, method):` Submits a form using a specified URL and HTTP method.  Might handle common submission tasks like preventing default form submission behavior.\n* `getFieldValue(formElement, fieldName):` Retrieves the value of a specific form field.\n* `clearForm(formElement):` Clears the values of all fields in a form.\n\n\n\nThe full list of available form handling functions, their parameters, and return values are documented in the API reference.  These functions significantly improve the ease of implementing form validation and submission, reducing the amount of custom code required.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors and Solutions\n\nThis section lists common errors encountered when using Fizzy UI Utils and provides solutions.\n\n**Error:**  `Uncaught ReferenceError: FizzyUIUtils is not defined`\n\n**Solution:** This usually means the library hasn't been correctly imported or included in your project. Double-check your import statements (e.g., `import { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils';` in JavaScript or the equivalent in your framework) and ensure the `fizzy-ui-utils` package is correctly installed and accessible in your project's dependency tree.  Verify the package name is correct and the path to the library is accurate.\n\n\n**Error:**  Component renders incorrectly or doesn't display at all.\n\n**Solution:** This could have several causes:\n    * **Incorrect props:** Check that you are passing the correct props to the component and that the prop types match the component's expected input. Consult the component's documentation for details on required and optional props.\n    * **Conflicting CSS:**  Check for any CSS conflicts that might be overriding the component's styles. Inspect the rendered HTML and CSS using your browser's developer tools to identify conflicting styles. Use browser developer tools to inspect the component's styles and ensure they are being applied correctly. Consider using more specific CSS selectors to avoid unintended style overwrites.\n    * **Incorrect usage:** Ensure you are using the component correctly according to its documentation.  Review examples and usage guidelines to ensure you are following best practices.\n    * **Missing dependencies:** Check if the component has any dependencies that need to be included separately.  The component's documentation will list any external libraries it relies on.\n\n\n**Error:**  Runtime errors related to specific component functionality.\n\n**Solution:**  Examine the error message carefully.  It usually indicates the problematic line of code and the nature of the error.  Look at the component's documentation for details on potential issues related to that functionality.  Use logging statements (e.g., `console.log`) to inspect the values of variables and the state of the application at various points to determine the source of the error.\n\n\n\nMore specific error messages and their solutions will be added as they are encountered and reported.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to inspect the rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This helps identify style issues, incorrect DOM structure, and JavaScript errors.\n* **Console Logging:** Use `console.log` statements strategically to track the values of variables, the flow of execution, and to inspect data at different points in your code.  This is crucial for identifying problems within component logic.\n* **Source Maps:** When debugging, ensure that source maps are enabled. Source maps help link the compiled/minified code back to the original source code, making it easier to debug.\n* **Version Control:**  Utilize version control (Git) to track changes and revert to previous working versions if necessary. This is invaluable in case of errors introduced during development.\n* **Read the Documentation:** The documentation provides comprehensive information on component usage, prop types, and common issues.  Before posting an issue, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed the documentation.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n* **Minimize unnecessary re-renders:**  In framework-based applications (like React, Vue, or Angular), ensure that you are optimizing re-rendering to minimize unnecessary updates.  Use techniques like memoization and shouldComponentUpdate (React) or similar mechanisms to enhance performance.\n* **Lazy Loading:** For large applications, consider lazy loading components to improve initial load times and prevent the entire application from being rendered at once.\n* **Avoid excessive DOM manipulations:** Use the DOM manipulation utilities provided by Fizzy UI Utils efficiently to avoid unnecessary operations.\n* **Optimize images:** Use appropriately sized and optimized images to prevent performance issues related to large image files.\n* **Code Splitting:**  If the library supports it, utilize code splitting to load only necessary parts of the library on demand, which will reduce initial bundle size.\n* **Profiling Tools:** Use browser performance profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your application.  These tools can pinpoint areas where optimization is needed.\n\n\nBy following these suggestions, you can improve the performance and responsiveness of your application.  Further performance optimization techniques might be explained in the library's advanced usage documentation.\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides detailed information about the available components and utility functions within Fizzy UI Utils.
