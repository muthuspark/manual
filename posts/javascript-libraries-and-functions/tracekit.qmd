## Introduction

### What is TraceKit?

TraceKit is a lightweight, client-side JavaScript library designed to capture and enhance JavaScript error reports.  It goes beyond basic error reporting by providing detailed stack traces, even in browsers that don't natively support them well (like older versions of Internet Explorer).  This allows developers to get richer, more actionable information when debugging JavaScript errors in production environments.  TraceKit processes raw error information, cleans it up, and formats it in a consistent way, making it easier to integrate with backend error tracking systems.


### Why use TraceKit?

Using TraceKit offers several significant advantages:

* **Improved Error Reporting:** Get more comprehensive stack traces, making it easier to pinpoint the source of errors.  This is particularly valuable in complex JavaScript applications.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** TraceKit handles inconsistencies in how different browsers report errors, providing a consistent experience regardless of the client's browser.
* **Enhanced Debugging:**  The detailed error information provided by TraceKit significantly speeds up the debugging process.
* **Easy Integration:** TraceKit is designed for straightforward integration into existing JavaScript projects.  It's lightweight and doesn't require significant changes to your codebase.
* **Customizability:** While providing a default robust solution, TraceKit allows for customization to fit your specific error handling needs.

### Key Features

* **Cross-browser stack trace processing:**  Consistent stack traces across all major browsers, including older, less-supported versions.
* **Error reporting enhancement:**  Adds context and details to error reports that are often missing from native error objects.
* **Lightweight and efficient:**  Minimal impact on application performance.
* **Flexible API:**  Allows for customization and integration with various backend systems.
* **Support for asynchronous errors:**  Captures errors that occur in asynchronous operations (e.g., promises, timeouts).
* **Client-side reporting:**  Errors are processed and formatted on the client before sending to your backend.


### Installation

TraceKit can be installed in several ways:

* **Download:** Download the latest version of TraceKit from [Insert link to download here]. Include the `tracekit.js` file in your HTML using a `<script>` tag.

* **npm:** If you are using npm, install it via:
  ```bash
  npm install tracekit
  ```
  Then require it in your JavaScript code:
  ```javascript
  const TraceKit = require('tracekit');
  ```

* **CDN:**  Use a CDN such as jsDelivr:
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tracekit@vX.X.X/tracekit.min.js"></script>  <!-- Replace vX.X.X with the actual version number -->
  ```
  Remember to replace `vX.X.X` with the appropriate version number.  Check the latest version on the project's website or repository.  After including TraceKit, you can then initialize and configure it as needed (refer to the Usage section in the manual for details).


## Core Functionality

### API Overview

TraceKit's core functionality revolves around its `TraceKit` object.  While the exact methods might vary slightly depending on the version, the fundamental approach remains consistent.  The most crucial methods typically include:

* **`TraceKit.report()`:** This is the primary method for reporting errors.  It accepts an error object (or, in some cases, just the error message) and automatically processes it to generate a detailed report.  This includes extracting the stack trace and other relevant information.  It often offers options for specifying additional context or modifying the report before it's sent.

* **`TraceKit.computeStackTrace()`:** This method is useful for independently computing the stack trace for an error. This provides a means to handle errors directly without relying on the automatic error reporting mechanism. It takes an error object as input and returns a stack trace object.

* **`TraceKit.wrap()`:**  A very helpful method for wrapping functions to catch errors within them. This is crucial for handling errors in asynchronous operations.  It takes a function as input and returns a wrapped version that handles any exceptions thrown within the original function.

* **`TraceKit.addHandler()` & `TraceKit.removeHandler()`:** Methods that allow adding or removing custom error handling functions. This provides extensibility and allows for integration with custom logging or reporting mechanisms.

These methods form the foundation for interacting with TraceKit. Specific usage examples and parameters are detailed in subsequent sections.


### Client-Side Error Handling

TraceKit enhances client-side error handling by providing a robust mechanism for capturing and processing JavaScript errors. The `TraceKit.report()` method is the central function for this. It automatically captures unhandled exceptions (`window.onerror`) and reports them along with detailed stack traces, even on browsers lacking robust native support.   This process typically involves:

1. **Error Capture:**  TraceKit registers an event handler that intercepts unhandled exceptions.
2. **Stack Trace Generation:** It utilizes sophisticated techniques to generate a stack trace from the exception, even if the native browser support is limited.
3. **Report Enhancement:**  The raw error information is processed and enriched with additional context (like the URL, user agent, etc.).
4. **Report Formatting:** The enriched error report is formatted into a structured format, often JSON.
5. **Report Transmission (Optional):** The formatted report can then be sent to a backend reporting service (this step requires additional integration).

The simple act of including TraceKit and calling `TraceKit.report()` dramatically improves the quality of error reports from the client-side.


### Report Formatting

TraceKit typically outputs error reports in a structured format, often JSON. The exact structure might vary depending on configuration, but usually includes:

* **`message`:** The error message.
* **`url`:** The URL where the error occurred.
* **`line`:** The line number where the error occurred.
* **`column`:** The column number where the error occurred.
* **`stack`:** An array representing the stack trace, with each element containing details like function name, file name, line number, and column number.
* **`useragent`:** The user's browser and operating system information.
* **`timestamp`:** A timestamp indicating when the error occurred.
* **Custom fields:**  These can be added to provide additional context relevant to your application.

This structured format is ideal for easy parsing and analysis by backend error tracking systems.


### Customizing Error Reporting

TraceKit allows for customization to fit specific needs. You can extend its functionality through:

* **Custom Handlers:** Add custom error handlers using `TraceKit.addHandler()` to modify how errors are processed before being sent to your backend or logged.  You can filter, modify, or augment the error reports as needed.
* **Report Filtering:** Define criteria for filtering which errors are reported to reduce noise.
* **Contextual Information:**  Add custom data to the error reports (e.g., user ID, session ID) to provide richer context for analysis.
* **Transport Mechanism:**  Modify how error reports are transmitted. By default, it might simply log to the console, but you can customize it to send reports using AJAX, websockets, or other means.

This flexibility allows TraceKit to seamlessly integrate with existing logging and error tracking infrastructures.


### Integration with Reporting Services

TraceKit's structured error reports are designed for easy integration with various backend reporting services.  The process usually involves:

1. **Capturing and Formatting:**  TraceKit captures and formats the errors as described above.
2. **Transmission:**  Your code needs to send the formatted JSON report to your chosen reporting service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, custom solutions).  This typically involves using AJAX or a similar mechanism.
3. **Backend Processing:** The backend service receives the report and processes it, storing it in a database and providing tools for analysis and visualization.

The integration specifics will depend on the reporting service you use.  TraceKit simplifies this process by providing a consistent, structured report that most backend services can easily handle.  Consult your chosen reporting service's documentation for precise integration instructions.


## Advanced Usage

### Handling Specific Error Types

While TraceKit automatically captures unhandled exceptions, you might need to handle specific error types or situations differently.  This can be accomplished using several techniques:

* **`try...catch` blocks:** Wrap potentially problematic code in `try...catch` blocks to catch specific exceptions and handle them gracefully.  You can then use `TraceKit.report()` to report these caught errors, adding extra context if needed.

* **Custom Handlers:** Use `TraceKit.addHandler()` to create custom handlers for specific error types or patterns.  This allows you to process errors differently based on their nature, for example, logging certain errors differently or suppressing others.  Examine the error object properties within your custom handler to determine the error type.

* **Filtering:** You might need to filter specific errors before they are reported to avoid reporting irrelevant or expected errors (e.g., errors from third-party libraries you're already monitoring).  This could involve checking the error message or stack trace within a custom handler and then deciding whether to report it or not.

By combining these methods, you can tailor error handling to meet your application's needs.


### Asynchronous Error Handling

Modern JavaScript applications heavily rely on asynchronous operations (promises, async/await, callbacks, etc.).  TraceKit addresses this through its `TraceKit.wrap()` function.

`TraceKit.wrap()` takes a function as input and returns a wrapped version of that function.  If the original function throws an error, the wrapped function catches it and sends the error report to TraceKit for processing.  This ensures that errors occurring within asynchronous code are correctly reported.  Example:

```javascript
const myAsyncFunction = async () => {
  // Some asynchronous operation...
  await somePromise();
};

const wrappedFunction = TraceKit.wrap(myAsyncFunction);

wrappedFunction().catch(error => {
    //Handle error if needed - TraceKit already reported it.
});
```

This is especially important for catching errors in `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, promises, and other asynchronous contexts, preventing them from slipping through the cracks.



### Debugging with TraceKit

TraceKit itself is helpful for debugging *client-side* JavaScript errors.  However,  you might also use TraceKit in conjunction with your browser's developer tools.  The detailed stack traces provided by TraceKit enhance the debugging experience within the developer tools by providing a more accurate and complete picture of the error’s origin.  Pay attention to the `stack` property within the TraceKit report. This detailed information allows you to pinpoint the problematic lines of code within the stack trace more efficiently than relying on the standard error output.


### Extending TraceKit

TraceKit's architecture is designed for extensibility. You can extend its functionality by:

* **Custom Handlers (Revisited):** Create custom error handlers to manipulate error reports, filter errors, or integrate with specialized logging mechanisms.
* **Plugin System (If Available):** If the version of TraceKit you're using supports a plugin system, develop plugins to add new features or customize existing ones.
* **Modifying the Core (Advanced):**  For highly specific needs, you might need to modify the TraceKit source code directly.  This is typically only recommended if you have a deep understanding of its internal workings and have contributed back your changes to the community (if possible).

Remember that modifying the core library might break future updates, so tread carefully.


### Performance Considerations

TraceKit is designed to be lightweight and efficient, but its usage still impacts performance, albeit minimally.   Consider these factors:

* **Error Reporting Frequency:**  Excessive error reporting can significantly impact performance.  Implement error filtering mechanisms to reduce the number of reports sent.
* **Report Size:** Minimize the amount of data included in your reports.  Only include necessary information to avoid sending unnecessary bytes.
* **Network Latency:** Sending reports over the network takes time and consumes resources.  Optimize network communication (batching, compression) to reduce overhead.
* **Asynchronous Reporting:**  Use asynchronous methods for reporting errors to prevent blocking the main thread.

Balancing detailed error reporting with performance is crucial for a production-ready application.   Profiling and performance testing can help determine the optimal balance for your application.


## Integration Guides

### Integrating with popular frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)

Integrating TraceKit with popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue requires a slightly different approach compared to integrating it directly into a vanilla JavaScript project.  The core concept remains the same: capture errors and send enhanced reports to your backend.  However, the implementation might involve using framework-specific mechanisms for error handling.

**React:**  In React applications, you can integrate TraceKit by wrapping your application's top-level component with an error boundary or utilizing lifecycle methods to catch errors. You can use `componentDidCatch` for error handling within components. For global error handling, you might need to wrap your main rendering function.

**Angular:** Angular's error handling mechanisms can be combined with TraceKit.  You could leverage Angular's `ErrorHandler` service to intercept and process errors, then use `TraceKit.report()` to enhance the error information before sending it to your backend.

**Vue:**  Similar to React, Vue's error handling usually involves using `errorCaptured` lifecycle hooks within components. You can use these hooks to capture errors and send enhanced reports using TraceKit. For global error handling, you can use the `Vue.config.errorHandler` option.

In all cases, the core TraceKit functionality remains the same:  you will likely use `TraceKit.report()` or `TraceKit.wrap()` to capture and enhance errors.  The framework-specific integration primarily involves using the framework's built-in error handling mechanisms to feed errors into TraceKit for processing.  Specific implementation details depend on the version of the framework and your project structure.


### Server-Side Integration

TraceKit is primarily a client-side library.  Its role is to capture and enhance error reports *on the client-side*.  The server-side integration involves setting up a backend service to receive and process these enhanced error reports from the client.  This server-side component doesn't directly use TraceKit; instead, it receives the structured JSON error reports generated by TraceKit and processes them.

This processing often involves:

1. **Receiving the Reports:**  Your server must handle incoming requests (e.g., via HTTP POST) carrying the JSON error reports from TraceKit.
2. **Data Storage:**  Store the received error reports in a database for later analysis.
3. **Error Analysis and Aggregation:**  Process the stored error data, aggregating similar errors and providing reporting tools.
4. **Alerting (Optional):**  Set up alerting mechanisms to notify developers of critical errors.

The specific server-side implementation (e.g., using Node.js, Python, etc.) depends on your technology stack and choice of error tracking solution.  Many backend error tracking services provide well-documented APIs for seamless integration.


### Browser Compatibility

TraceKit is designed to work across a wide range of browsers, including older versions that lack comprehensive native error reporting features.  However, the level of detail in stack traces and the overall reliability might differ slightly depending on the browser and its version.  Generally, modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) provide excellent support.  Older browsers (especially older versions of Internet Explorer) will have less detailed stack traces, but TraceKit works to improve this.

While TraceKit strives for broad compatibility, thorough testing across your target browsers is recommended.  Pay attention to any limitations documented in the specific TraceKit version you are using.  Always test your application with the browsers that are most important to your user base.  Consider using a browser testing framework to automate this process.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

This section addresses common problems encountered when using TraceKit.

* **No error reports are being received:**
    * **Check integration:** Verify that TraceKit is correctly integrated into your application and that the `TraceKit.report()` function is called appropriately (or that `TraceKit.wrap()` is used for asynchronous functions).
    * **Network issues:** Ensure there are no network problems preventing the error reports from reaching your server. Check your server logs and browser's network tab for errors.
    * **Server-side configuration:** Verify that your server is correctly configured to receive and process the incoming error reports.
    * **CORS issues (if applicable):** If you're sending reports from a different domain than your server, ensure that your server's CORS settings are correctly configured.


* **Incomplete or inaccurate stack traces:**
    * **Browser compatibility:** Older browsers might have limitations in generating stack traces. TraceKit aims to mitigate this, but some inaccuracies might still occur.
    * **Minified code:** Minified JavaScript code makes it harder to generate accurate stack traces.  Consider using source maps to improve the quality of the stack traces.
    * **Frameworks/Libraries:** Certain frameworks or libraries may interfere with TraceKit's ability to generate complete stack traces.

* **Errors not being caught:**
    * **`try...catch` blocks:** If you are using `try...catch` blocks, ensure they are placed correctly and are handling the specific error types you expect.
    * **Asynchronous operations:** Remember to use `TraceKit.wrap()` for functions that run asynchronously to ensure errors within these functions are correctly caught and reported.
    * **Event handling:** If the error occurs within an event handler (e.g., an error during an AJAX call), make sure that the event handler itself is properly wrapped with `TraceKit.wrap()` or that the error is handled within the event handler's logic.


* **TraceKit conflicts with other libraries:**
    * **Check for conflicts:** If you suspect a conflict, try disabling other libraries temporarily to see if the issue resolves.
    * **Load order:** Pay attention to the order in which JavaScript files are loaded.  Ensure that TraceKit is loaded after any libraries that might interfere with its functionality.


### Debugging Tips

* **Console Logging:**  Use `console.log()` strategically to inspect variables, confirm function execution, and track the flow of your code. Check the browser's developer console for any errors or unexpected behavior.

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (Network tab, Console, Sources) to monitor network requests, view error messages, and step through code using the debugger.  The "Sources" panel can help you analyze the stack traces provided by TraceKit.

* **Source Maps:** If you're using minified code, use source maps to enable debugging in the unminified version.  This greatly improves the readability of stack traces.

* **Simplify:** If you're encountering complex problems, try to isolate the problematic parts of your code and test them independently.  Create minimal reproducible examples to pinpoint the source of the error.

* **Check TraceKit's Report:** Carefully examine the structure of the error report generated by TraceKit.  It often contains valuable information that can help you identify the root cause.


### Known Limitations

* **Minification:** While TraceKit does its best to handle minified code, source maps are strongly recommended for accurate stack trace generation in production environments.

* **Browser inconsistencies:**  While TraceKit strives for cross-browser compatibility, some subtle differences in how browsers handle errors might still lead to slight variations in the quality of the reported stack traces.

* **Complex asynchronous flows:**  In very complex asynchronous operations, it might be challenging to obtain perfectly accurate stack traces in all cases.  Break down overly complex asynchronous flows into smaller, more manageable pieces.

* **Circular references:**  In rare cases, circular references in your application's objects might cause errors or issues when generating error reports.

* **Performance overhead:**  While TraceKit is designed to be lightweight, there's always some performance overhead associated with error handling and reporting.  Excessive use might impact performance, so balance thorough error reporting with performance considerations.

These limitations are usually minor and do not significantly hinder TraceKit's effectiveness in most scenarios.  Staying up-to-date with the latest version of TraceKit and understanding these limitations helps to mitigate potential issues.


## API Reference

This section provides detailed information on TraceKit's core API methods.  Note that the exact parameters and return values might vary slightly depending on the specific TraceKit version you're using.  Always refer to the documentation for your version.

### `TraceKit.report(exception, options)`

This is the primary method for reporting errors to TraceKit. It takes two arguments:

* **`exception`:**  This is the error object (e.g., the object thrown in a `try...catch` block) or, in some cases, a simple string describing the error.  If it's a string, the `message` property of the internal report will be set to that string. If not a string, the entire exception object will be used.

* **`options` (Optional):** An object containing optional settings:
    * `url`:  The URL where the error occurred (overrides the automatically detected URL).
    * `stack`: A pre-computed stack trace (optional, can be used to supply your own stack trace).
    * `logger`: A custom logger function for handling the output (overrides the default logging).
    * `onerror`: If true, registers the `window.onerror` handler automatically (defaults to true).  This is generally how it's used. If false, you'd need to handle the `window.onerror` event yourself.

**Return Value:** The method typically doesn't return a value directly; instead, it processes the error and performs the necessary actions based on its configuration (logging, sending to a server, etc.).

**Example:**

```javascript
try {
  // Some code that might throw an error
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
} catch (error) {
  TraceKit.report(error);
}
```


### `TraceKit.remote(options)`

This function configures the mechanism for sending error reports remotely (typically to a backend service). Note that some TraceKit versions might not include this, but it is a common method available in several versions.   The `options` parameter is an object that specifies the endpoint and transmission method:

* `url`: The URL of your backend service where error reports should be sent.
* `post`: (boolean) `true` to use `POST` (default), otherwise, use `GET`.
* `async`: (boolean) whether the request is async.  Defaults to true. This is recommended for client-side error handling.
* `callback`: A callback function that is executed after the report is sent (successful or not).

**Return Value:** Usually returns an object representing the configuration or a promise if used asynchronously.

**Example:**

```javascript
TraceKit.remote({ url: '/api/errors', async: true, callback: function (response) {
    //Handle response from server
} });
```


### `TraceKit.computeStackTrace(exception)`

This method computes a stack trace for a given exception.  It's useful for getting stack traces independently, which might be necessary in specific scenarios where you need more control over the stack trace generation process.  It takes one argument:

* **`exception`:** The error object.

**Return Value:**  An object representing the stack trace.  The structure of this object depends on the version but typically includes information such as frames, function names, file names, line numbers, and column numbers.


### `TraceKit.wrap(func)`

This method wraps a function to catch any errors that occur within that function and report them using TraceKit. This is particularly useful for handling errors in asynchronous operations. It takes one argument:

* **`func`:** The function to be wrapped.

**Return Value:** A wrapped version of the input function.  When the wrapped function is executed, any errors within the original function will be caught and reported to TraceKit.

**Example:**

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {
  // Some code that might throw an error
  throw new Error("Error in myFunction");
};

const wrappedFunction = TraceKit.wrap(myFunction);

wrappedFunction(); // Any error in myFunction will be reported by TraceKit
```


### `TraceKit.collectWindowErrors(options)`


This method registers a global error handler using `window.onerror`. This is commonly done automatically when you call `TraceKit.report()` with `onerror` set to `true` (which is the default). However, this function lets you explicitly control how window errors are handled, potentially using custom options.  The `options` parameter should contain settings consistent with what can be passed to `TraceKit.report()`.

**Return Value:** This function typically doesn't return a value.  It sets up the `window.onerror` handler internally.  If an error occurs, it will be processed and reported by TraceKit.  This provides a more robust mechanism for catching global JavaScript errors, even those not explicitly caught in `try...catch` blocks.
