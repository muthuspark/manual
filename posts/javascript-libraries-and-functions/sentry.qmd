### What is Sentry?

Sentry is an application monitoring and error tracking platform.  It helps developers identify, understand, and fix crashes in real time.  It goes beyond basic error logging by providing detailed context around errors, including user information, browser details, and even the complete stack trace. This rich context drastically reduces the time it takes to diagnose and resolve issues, leading to improved application stability and a better user experience.  Sentry supports a wide range of languages and frameworks, making it a versatile solution for diverse development environments.  It allows for proactive monitoring, allowing developers to anticipate and address potential problems *before* they impact users.

### Why Use Sentry for JavaScript?

JavaScript applications, especially those running in browsers or within Node.js environments, can be notoriously difficult to debug. Sentry provides several key advantages for JavaScript developers:

* **Client-side and Server-side Error Tracking:** Monitor errors in both your frontend (browser) and backend (Node.js) JavaScript code from a single dashboard.
* **Source Maps Support:**  Accurately map minified code back to its original source, simplifying debugging of production-ready JavaScript.
* **Automatic Breadcrumbs:**  Sentry automatically captures breadcrumbs (contextual events leading up to the error), providing valuable insight into the user's actions before the error occurred.  This helps recreate the error scenario more accurately.
* **Easy Integration with Popular Frameworks:**  Seamless integration with React, Angular, Vue.js, and other popular JavaScript frameworks.
* **Performance Monitoring for SPAs:** Track the performance of your Single-Page Applications (SPAs) to identify slowdowns and improve user experience.


### Setting up your first Sentry project

1. **Create a Sentry Account:** Sign up for a free Sentry account at [https://sentry.io/](https://sentry.io/).

2. **Create a New Project:** Once logged in, create a new project. Select the appropriate platform (e.g., "JavaScript" if you are working on a web application).  You'll be given a DSN (Data Source Name).  **Keep this DSN safe; it's crucial for connecting your application to Sentry.**

3. **Install the Sentry SDK:**  Choose the appropriate SDK for your JavaScript framework (e.g., `@sentry/browser` for web applications, `@sentry/node` for Node.js). Install it via npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install @sentry/browser --save
   # or
   yarn add @sentry/browser
   ```

4. **Initialize the SDK:** In your JavaScript code, initialize the Sentry SDK with your DSN:

   ```javascript
   import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

   Sentry.init({
     dsn: "YOUR_DSN_HERE", // Replace with your actual DSN
     integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()], // For tracing
   });
   ```

5. **Test it out:** Introduce a deliberate error in your code (e.g., accessing a non-existent property).  Refresh your application. You should see the error appear in your Sentry project dashboard.

6. **Configure Options (Optional):** Explore the numerous configuration options available in the Sentry SDK documentation to customize your error reporting (e.g., environment, release version, sample rate).

Remember to replace `"YOUR_DSN_HERE"` with your actual DSN from your Sentry project settings.  Consult the official Sentry documentation for the most up-to-date instructions and advanced configuration options.


## Installation and Setup

This section details how to install and configure the Sentry JavaScript SDKs for both browser and Node.js environments.

### Installing the Sentry JavaScript SDK

Sentry offers distinct SDKs for different JavaScript environments.  The core SDK, `@sentry/core`, provides fundamental functionality, while specialized SDKs like `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/node` offer platform-specific integrations and features.

Choose the appropriate SDK based on your application's environment:

* **`@sentry/browser`:** For web applications running in browsers. This SDK automatically integrates with common browser features and provides features like performance monitoring.
* **`@sentry/node`:** For Node.js applications running on servers.  This SDK focuses on server-side error reporting and includes integrations relevant to Node.js environments.
* **`@sentry/react`:** For React applications. This SDK builds upon `@sentry/browser` and integrates with React's error boundaries and context.  (Similar SDKs exist for other frameworks like Angular and Vue.js)
* **`@sentry/core`:** This is the core SDK which provides fundamental error handling and reporting features.  You would use this as a foundation if building your own custom SDK or if you need extreme control over the setup, but for most use cases the platform-specific SDKs are preferred.

You can install the SDK using either npm or yarn.


### Initializing the SDK

After installing the chosen SDK, you must initialize it with your DSN (Data Source Name) and any desired configuration options. This typically involves a single call to the `Sentry.init()` function.

**Basic Initialization (Browser):**

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE', // Replace with your actual DSN
});
```

**Initialization with Integrations (Browser - Recommended):**

Adding integrations enhances Sentry's capabilities. The `Integrations` object provides pre-built integrations for features like tracing and debugging performance issues.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()], // Enables automatic performance tracing
});
```

**Basic Initialization (Node.js):**

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
});
```

Remember to replace `'YOUR_DSN_HERE'` with your actual DSN obtained from your Sentry project settings.


### Configuring the SDK

The `Sentry.init()` function accepts a configuration object with numerous options to tailor Sentry's behavior. Key configuration options include:

* **`dsn` (required):** Your project's DSN.
* **`environment`:**  Specifies the environment (e.g., 'production', 'development', 'staging'). This helps organize and filter errors.
* **`release`:** The version of your application.  Useful for tracking errors across releases.
* **`sampleRate`:** Controls the percentage of events sent to Sentry (useful for reducing data volume in development).
* **`integrations`:** An array of Sentry integrations to enable specific features (e.g., tracing, error boundaries).
* **`beforeSend`:** A function to modify or prevent events from being sent to Sentry.  Useful for custom filtering or event transformation.
* **`tracesSampleRate`:** The rate at which transactions are sampled for performance monitoring.


Refer to the official Sentry documentation for a complete list of configuration options and their details.


### Different Integration Methods (npm, yarn, CDN)

**npm:**

```bash
npm install @sentry/browser --save
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add @sentry/browser
```

**CDN (less recommended for production):**  While possible to include the Sentry SDK via a CDN link, it's generally less recommended for production deployments due to potential caching issues and the lack of fine-grained control offered by npm/yarn. Check the Sentry documentation for the current CDN links if you choose this method.  This method will usually involve adding a `<script>` tag to your HTML.


### Browser vs Node.js Setup Differences

The core functionality of the Sentry SDK remains consistent between browser and Node.js environments; however, some key differences exist:

* **SDK Packages:**  Use `@sentry/browser` for browser-based applications and `@sentry/node` for Node.js server-side applications.
* **Integrations:** Browser integrations often include features like browser-specific error handling, performance monitoring (via `@sentry/tracing`), and automatic breadcrumbs. Node.js integrations might focus on HTTP request handling and server-specific error contexts.
* **Environment Context:**  The environment context (e.g., user agent, network information) collected automatically differs between the two environments.  Node.js typically focuses on server-side information such as process details, while browser focuses on client side characteristics.
* **Error Handling:** Browser JavaScript errors are automatically captured; however,  Node.js requires more explicit error handling within your application code to ensure errors are reported to Sentry.


Remember to always consult the official Sentry documentation for the most up-to-date and detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and usage for each SDK.


## Basic Usage and Error Reporting

This section covers the fundamental aspects of using the Sentry SDK to report errors and other relevant information.

### Reporting Errors Automatically

The Sentry JavaScript SDKs automatically capture many common JavaScript errors.  For browser-based applications using `@sentry/browser`, this includes uncaught exceptions and errors within `Promise` rejections.  For Node.js applications,  errors that bubble up to the top-level event loop are automatically captured.  However, for robust error tracking, explicitly reporting errors (as shown in the next section) is recommended.  Automatic capture provides a safety net, but manual reporting offers more control and context.


### Manually Reporting Errors and Messages

While the SDK automatically captures many errors, explicitly reporting errors using `Sentry.captureException()` and `Sentry.captureMessage()` offers greater control and allows you to add crucial context.

* **`Sentry.captureException(error)`:**  Reports an exception object (e.g., an `Error` object thrown by your code).

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
  const result = 1 / 0; // Division by zero
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
}
```

* **`Sentry.captureMessage(message)`:** Reports a simple error message as a string.

```javascript
Sentry.captureMessage('An unexpected issue occurred.');
```

* **`Sentry.captureEvent(event)`:** Provides the most control over the reported event, allowing customization of all event properties.  Consult the Sentry documentation for details on the event structure.


### Setting Extra Context (User, Tags, Breadcrumbs)

Enriching error reports with context significantly speeds up debugging.  The Sentry SDK allows you to add user information, tags, and breadcrumbs to provide valuable insights into the state of your application before an error occurred.

* **User Context:**  Identify the affected user (while respecting privacy).  Use `Sentry.setUser()` to associate an ID or other identifying information with an error.

```javascript
Sentry.setUser({ id: 'user123', email: 'user@example.com' }); // Avoid sensitive data like PII in production
```

* **Tags:** Add key-value pairs to categorize and filter errors.  Use `Sentry.setTag()` for individual tags or `Sentry.setTags()` to set multiple tags at once.

```javascript
Sentry.setTag('environment', 'production');
Sentry.setTags({'feature': 'login', 'version': '2.0'});
```

* **Breadcrumbs:** Create a trail of events leading up to an error to help reconstruct the sequence of actions. Use `Sentry.addBreadcrumb()`.

```javascript
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
  category: 'ui',
  message: 'User clicked login button',
  data: { buttonId: 'loginBtn' }
});
```


### Handling Uncaught Exceptions

While the SDK attempts to capture uncaught exceptions automatically, explicitly handling them provides a more graceful user experience and potentially allows for cleanup before the application crashes.  The `window.onerror` (browser) or `process.on('uncaughtException')` (Node.js) events can be used.


**Browser (using `window.onerror`):**

```javascript
window.onerror = function (message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error || new Error(message));
  return true; // Prevents the default browser error handling.
};
```


**Node.js (using `process.on('uncaughtException')`):**

```javascript
process.on('uncaughtException', (error) => {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
  // Consider adding graceful shutdown logic here
  process.exit(1); // Exit the process to prevent further issues
});
```


### Reporting Performance Issues

Use Sentry's tracing capabilities to monitor the performance of your application.  This involves instrumenting your code to track the duration and status of transactions (individual operations or units of work).

(Note: This requires setting up the `@sentry/tracing` integration, as shown in the earlier setup sections).


### Example: Integrating Sentry into a React app

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing(),
    new Sentry.Integrations.React(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Capture 100% of transactions
});

function MyComponent() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    try {
      // Some potentially error-prone code
      const result = 1/0;
    } catch (error) {
      Sentry.captureException(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Remember to install the necessary packages:  `npm install @sentry/react @sentry/tracing`.  Replace `'YOUR_DSN_HERE'` with your actual DSN.  This example demonstrates basic error handling within a React component, along with enabling tracing.  More advanced React usage may involve integrating with React's error boundaries for more comprehensive error handling within your React component structure.


## Advanced Configuration

This section delves into more advanced configuration options within the Sentry SDK, allowing for fine-grained control over error reporting and data collection.

### Customizing Error Handling

Beyond the basic `Sentry.captureException()` and `Sentry.captureMessage()` methods, Sentry offers several ways to customize error handling:

* **`beforeSend` callback:** This function allows you to inspect and modify an event before it's sent to Sentry.  You can use it to filter out specific events, add extra data, or even prevent an event from being sent altogether.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Check if the event is from a specific source
    if (event.exception && event.exception.values[0].type === 'MyCustomError') {
      // Add extra context
      event.extra = { extraData: 'Additional info' };
    } else if (event.exception && event.exception.values[0].type === 'IgnoreThisError') {
      return null; // Don't send this event to Sentry
    }
    return event;
  },
});
```

* **`integrations`:** Control which built-in integrations are active.  Disabling integrations can reduce the amount of data collected and improve performance.  For instance, you might disable the `BrowserTracing` integration in a non-production environment.

* **`sampleRate`:** This option allows you to randomly sample a percentage of events to reduce the volume of data sent to Sentry, especially helpful in high-traffic environments or during development.  A `sampleRate` of 0.1 means only 10% of events are sent.


### Breadcrumbs and Context Enrichment

Breadcrumbs provide a trail of events preceding an error, offering valuable context for debugging.  Advanced usage includes:

* **Custom Breadcrumbs:** Beyond the automatic breadcrumbs, create custom breadcrumbs to track significant user interactions or application events.  Use `Sentry.addBreadcrumb()` with detailed information.

```javascript
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
  category: 'api',
  message: 'API call made',
  type: 'http',
  data: { url: '/api/users', method: 'GET', status: 200 },
  level: Sentry.Severity.Log //Set severity level (info, warning, error, etc.)
});
```

* **Context manipulation:**  Use `Sentry.setContext()`, `Sentry.setExtra()`, `Sentry.setTags()`, and `Sentry.setUser()` to associate various types of data with an event, improving the richness of error reports and aiding in the investigation process.  Ensure you respect user privacy when setting user-related data.


### Sampling and Rate Limiting

For high-volume applications, sampling and rate limiting are crucial for managing the amount of data sent to Sentry.

* **`sampleRate` (already mentioned):** Controls the overall sampling rate of events.
* **Client-side rate limiting:** The SDK itself might perform rate limiting to avoid overwhelming Sentry's servers under extremely high error rates.
* **Server-side rate limiting:** Sentry's servers also employ rate limiting to ensure system stability and prevent abuse.


### Integration with other tools and services

Sentry integrates with numerous third-party tools to streamline your workflow. Examples include:

* **Issue Trackers (Jira, GitHub, etc.):**  Automatically create issues in your issue tracker when new errors appear.
* **Communication Platforms (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.):**  Receive instant alerts about critical errors through your preferred communication channels.
* **CI/CD Pipelines:**  Integrate Sentry into your build and deployment process to track errors across different releases.


### Session Tracking

Sentry can track user sessions, providing insights into session duration, crashes per session, and user engagement.  This allows you to identify problematic patterns related to user activity and application stability.  Enabling session tracking usually involves using specific SDK integrations or configuration options.


### Transactions

Transactions represent units of work within your application.  They are crucial for performance monitoring, especially in applications with complex interactions.  Properly instrumenting your application with transactions provides a view into the performance bottlenecks.  This often involves using the `@sentry/tracing` integration to track the duration of specific functions or API calls, giving you a clear picture of where your application spends most of its time.   You can define start and end points, which will help you visualize your application flow better.


Remember to always refer to the official Sentry documentation for the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on advanced configuration options and best practices.  The specifics of certain integrations and features may vary depending on the SDK version and your chosen platform (browser vs. Node.js).


## Integrations

Sentry provides official and community-supported integrations for various JavaScript frameworks and libraries, streamlining error reporting and context collection.

### React Integration

The `@sentry/react` package provides seamless integration with React applications.  It leverages React's error boundaries to catch and report errors within components.  Key features include:

* **Automatic error boundary handling:**  Catches errors within React components and automatically reports them to Sentry.
* **Source map support:**  Accurately maps minified code back to the original source code for easier debugging.
* **Integration with React Router:** Tracks route changes as breadcrumbs, providing valuable context for errors related to navigation.


**Installation:**

```bash
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/tracing --save
```

**Initialization:**

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing(),
    new Sentry.Integrations.React(),
  ],
});
```

### Angular Integration

While there isn't a dedicated `@sentry/angular` package, integrating Sentry into Angular applications is straightforward using the `@sentry/browser` SDK.  You can leverage Angular's error handling mechanisms and Zone.js to capture errors.  Consider using Angular's error handling capabilities in conjunction with Sentry to handle errors gracefully.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install @sentry/browser --save
```

**Initialization:** (within your Angular application's initialization process, perhaps in `app.module.ts` or a similar entry point)

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/angular';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';


@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class SentryService {
  constructor() {
    Sentry.init({
      dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
      integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
      tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
    });
  }
}
```

Then, ensure that the `SentryService` is imported and included in the relevant Angular module.

### Vue.js Integration

Similar to Angular, the `@sentry/browser` SDK works well with Vue.js.  You can manually capture exceptions using `Sentry.captureException()` or integrate with Vue's error handling mechanisms.  Consider using Vue's error handling in conjunction with Sentry's error handling to provide a robust error-reporting system.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install @sentry/browser --save
```

**Initialization:** (within your Vue application's `main.js` or a similar entry point)

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
});

Vue.config.errorHandler = (error, instance, info) => {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
};

new Vue({
  // ... your Vue app configuration
});
```

### Node.js Integration

The `@sentry/node` package specifically targets Node.js applications.  It integrates with the Node.js event loop to capture uncaught exceptions and provides support for features specific to server-side environments, like request context.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install @sentry/node --save
```

**Initialization:**

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
});
```

You may need to handle uncaught exceptions explicitly using `process.on('uncaughtException')` to ensure they're properly reported to Sentry.


### Other Framework and Library Integrations

Sentry maintains a list of supported integrations on their website.  This list is frequently updated, so check their official documentation for the most current information.  Many popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries may have community-supported integrations or examples readily available.


### Custom Integrations

For frameworks or libraries not officially supported, you can create custom integrations. This generally involves creating a class that implements the required Sentry integration interface, handling specific aspects of error capturing and context enrichment relevant to the target framework or library. Refer to Sentry's documentation for the details of creating custom integrations. This typically involves extending the base integration class and providing relevant methods to capture context and handle specific framework-related events.


Remember that the specific initialization and configuration details may vary slightly depending on the framework and SDK version.  Consult the official Sentry documentation for the most accurate and updated instructions for each integration.


## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

This section guides you through effectively using Sentry's dashboard and tools to monitor your application's health and troubleshoot issues.

### Understanding Sentry's Dashboard

The Sentry dashboard provides a centralized view of your application's errors and performance.  Key areas include:

* **Issues:** Displays a list of unique error groups, each representing a distinct type of error.  Each issue is ranked by frequency and impact.
* **Projects:**  Shows all projects linked to your account, allowing you to navigate between different applications.
* **Events:** Provides detailed information about individual error instances (events) within an issue.  Each event contains stack traces, context, and user information.
* **Releases:** Tracks deployments and allows you to correlate errors with specific releases.
* **Performance:** (If performance monitoring is enabled) Visualizes performance metrics, such as transaction durations and error rates, providing insights into application bottlenecks.
* **Alerts:** (If configured)  Provides notifications about critical errors and performance issues.


Familiarize yourself with the dashboard's navigation and filtering options to effectively monitor your applications.


### Filtering and Searching Issues

The Sentry dashboard provides robust filtering and search capabilities to isolate specific issues:

* **Filtering:** Use filters to narrow down issues based on various criteria, such as environment, release version, error type, user attributes, and custom tags.
* **Search:**  Search for issues using keywords related to error messages, stack traces, or other relevant data within the error context.  Sentry's search is powerful and supports various search operators.
* **Grouping:** Issues are intelligently grouped based on error type and related contexts.  This helps identify common error patterns.


Effective filtering and searching are crucial for prioritizing and managing issues.


### Analyzing Error Reports

Analyzing error reports involves understanding the details provided in individual events:

* **Stack Trace:**  This shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error, pinpointing the exact location of the problem in your code.
* **Context:**  The context includes user data (anonymized), browser information (for browser applications), server information (for Node.js applications), and any custom context you've added.
* **Breadcrumbs:**  These events provide a trail of activities that occurred before the error, offering valuable clues about the root cause.
* **Tags:**  These key-value pairs assist in categorizing and filtering errors.
* **Exception Information:** Details about the error itself.


Thoroughly examine these details to understand the cause and impact of each error.


### Using Debug Tools

Sentry offers several tools to aid in debugging:

* **Source Maps:**  These map minified code back to its original, readable source, simplifying the debugging process for production-level code.  Ensure you upload source maps to Sentry as part of your release process.
* **Debug Symbols:**  Similar to source maps but useful for debugging native code (e.g., in some specific scenarios when dealing with native modules).
* **Remote Debugging:**  Integrate with your favorite remote debugging tools to investigate the application's state in real-time.


Properly using these tools streamlines the debugging process.


### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Common Sentry integration issues:

* **No errors appearing:** Double-check the DSN, ensure the SDK is properly initialized, and verify the SDK is included in your application’s build process.
* **Incorrect error reporting:** Verify the correctness of your `dsn`, check your configuration, and review the data being sent to Sentry using the `beforeSend` handler if necessary.
* **Performance issues:**  Ensure that Sentry integrations don't create significant performance overhead. Consider using sampling (`sampleRate`) to reduce data volume if necessary.
* **Missing context:** Verify that you're correctly adding user context, tags, and breadcrumbs.
* **Issues with source maps:** Ensure you're correctly generating and uploading source maps.  Verify the mapping is accurate.


If you encounter issues not covered here, consult Sentry's documentation and community forums for additional assistance.  The Sentry support channels offer valuable resources for solving more complex problems.


## Performance Monitoring

Sentry's performance monitoring capabilities extend beyond basic error tracking, allowing you to proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks in your applications.

### Setting up Performance Monitoring

Enabling performance monitoring typically involves:

1. **Installing the necessary packages:**  Ensure you have the appropriate Sentry SDK installed (e.g., `@sentry/browser` or `@sentry/node`).  Crucially, you'll likely need the `@sentry/tracing` package for transaction tracing.

2. **Initializing the SDK with tracing integration:** When initializing the Sentry SDK, include the `Integrations.BrowserTracing()` (for browser applications) or equivalent integration for your environment.  This enables automatic transaction tracing.

   ```javascript
   import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
   import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

   Sentry.init({
     dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE',
     integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
     tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust sampling rate as needed
   });
   ```

3. **(Optional) Manual instrumentation:** For more granular control, you can manually instrument specific parts of your application to track custom transactions.  This allows you to define transactions that are meaningful to your application's architecture.

4. **Adjust sampling rate:**  The `tracesSampleRate` option controls the percentage of transactions that are sent to Sentry.  Lowering this value (e.g., to 0.1 for 10%) reduces the amount of data sent, which is beneficial for high-traffic applications.


### Understanding Performance Metrics

Once performance monitoring is enabled, Sentry will collect various metrics, including:

* **Transaction durations:** The time it takes for a transaction (e.g., a network request, a route change, or a specific function) to complete.
* **Span durations:** If you use spans to break down transactions into smaller sub-units of work, you'll see durations for these spans.
* **Error rates:** The percentage of transactions that resulted in errors.
* **Distribution of durations:** Visual representations (histograms) showing the distribution of transaction durations, helping identify outliers.
* **Slowest transactions:**  A list of transactions that took the longest time to complete.
* **Error counts:** The number of errors that occurred within each transaction.


Analyzing these metrics provides insights into the performance characteristics of your application.


### Identifying Performance Bottlenecks

By examining the collected performance data, you can pinpoint performance bottlenecks:

* **Slow transactions:** Identify transactions with unusually long durations.  Investigate the code within those transactions to find the root cause of the slowdowns.
* **High error rates:** Transactions with a high error rate indicate problematic code that needs attention.
* **Correlation with errors:** Look for correlations between slow transactions and error rates. This may indicate that slowdowns are leading to errors.
* **Flame graphs:** Sentry's visualization tools may provide flame graphs, which show the call stack and execution time of each function within a transaction, making it easy to locate performance hotspots.


Effective bottleneck identification requires careful analysis of the collected metrics and their relationships.


### Improving Application Performance

Once you've identified performance bottlenecks, you can apply various techniques to optimize your application:

* **Code optimization:** Refactor inefficient code sections to improve performance.
* **Database optimization:**  Optimize database queries to reduce latency.
* **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of expensive operations.
* **Asynchronous operations:**  Use asynchronous operations where possible to prevent blocking operations.
* **Network optimization:** Minimize the number of network requests and optimize network calls.
* **Resource optimization:** Optimize the use of CPU, memory, and other resources.
* **Third-party library optimization:**  Consider using alternative libraries or optimizing usage of existing ones.


Implementing these optimizations often involves iterative improvements and thorough testing to verify the effectiveness of the changes.  Remember to monitor your application's performance over time using Sentry to track the impact of any optimizations.


## Security Considerations

Security is paramount when using Sentry.  This section outlines important security practices to protect your data and applications.

### Protecting Sensitive Data

Sentry automatically anonymizes much of the data it collects, but you must take additional steps to protect sensitive information:

* **Avoid sending sensitive data:** Do not include personally identifiable information (PII), credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data in error reports or custom breadcrumbs.  Sentry provides mechanisms to filter and redact sensitive data, but it's best to avoid including it in the first place.
* **Use environment variables:** Store sensitive information, such as your DSN, as environment variables instead of hardcoding them directly in your code.
* **Configure data scrubbing:**  Sentry offers features for automatically redacting or scrubbing specific data patterns from error reports.  Use these features to remove sensitive data from logs.  These features are often configurable through your Sentry project settings.
* **Regularly review your data:**  Periodically review the data collected by Sentry to ensure no sensitive information has inadvertently been sent.
* **Utilize `beforeSend`:** Use the `beforeSend` callback to perform custom data sanitization and prevent transmission of sensitive data.


### Authentication and Authorization

Sentry's access control mechanisms help you manage who can access your project data:

* **Project roles:** Assign roles (e.g., member, admin) to users, controlling their access to project settings and data.
* **Team management:** Organize users into teams to streamline access control across multiple projects.
* **Two-factor authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA for an extra layer of security for your Sentry account.
* **Regular password changes:** Encourage users to change their passwords regularly.
* **Session timeouts:** Configure appropriate session timeouts to limit the duration of access.


Properly configuring authentication and authorization is critical to restricting access to sensitive data and maintaining the security of your Sentry account.


### Data Privacy

Compliance with data privacy regulations (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) requires careful consideration:

* **Data minimization:**  Only collect the necessary data for debugging and monitoring.

## API Reference

This section provides a high-level overview of the Sentry APIs.  For complete and up-to-date details, always refer to the official Sentry documentation.  The APIs are subject to change, so checking the latest version is crucial.

### Client API

The Sentry client SDKs (e.g., `@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/node`, `@sentry/react`) expose a JavaScript API for interacting with the Sentry service.  Key functions include:

* **`Sentry.init(options)`:** Initializes the Sentry SDK with the provided configuration options (DSN, environment, integrations, etc.).  This is the fundamental starting point for using the SDK.

* **`Sentry.captureException(error)`:** Captures and sends an exception to Sentry.  The `error` parameter is typically an instance of the JavaScript `Error` object or a similar exception.

* **`Sentry.captureMessage(message)`:** Captures and sends a simple error message (string) to Sentry.

* **`Sentry.captureEvent(event)`:**  Allows capturing a fully structured event object, providing maximum control over the data sent to Sentry.  This is typically used for advanced scenarios where you want fine-grained control over the event properties.

* **`Sentry.addBreadcrumb(breadcrumb)`:** Adds a breadcrumb to the current session, providing context for events.  Breadcrumbs show a sequence of events before an error occurred.

* **`Sentry.setUser(user)`:** Sets user context for the current session.  User data is typically anonymized in production.

* **`Sentry.setTag(key, value)`:** Adds a tag to the current session.  Tags are key-value pairs used to categorize and filter events.

* **`Sentry.setExtra(key, value)`:** Adds extra context to the current session.  This allows adding arbitrary key-value pairs relevant to the current state.

* **`Sentry.setContext(key, value)`:** Sets context data for the current session.  Similar to `setExtra`, but specifically designed for named contexts (e.g., 'user', 'request').

* **`Sentry.flush()`:** Flushes any pending events to Sentry.  Useful before application shutdown or similar scenarios to ensure all events are processed.

* **`Sentry.close()`:**  Closes the Sentry client and stops further event processing.  This is generally used during application shutdown.

* **`Sentry.getCurrentHub()`:**  Gets the current Sentry Hub instance.  The Hub manages the active client and its state.

* **`Sentry.withScope(callback)`:**  Executes a callback function within a specific scope, allowing modifying the scope (e.g., adding breadcrumbs) before an event is captured.


These are some of the most commonly used functions.  The full API documentation provides a complete list of methods and their parameters.


### Server API

The Sentry server API allows programmatic interaction with Sentry's backend.  This API is primarily used for integrating Sentry with other systems, automating tasks, or accessing detailed data programmatically.  Examples include:

* **Projects API:** Create, update, and manage Sentry projects.
* **Issues API:** Get information about issues, update issue statuses, and manage comments.
* **Events API:** Retrieve raw event data for further analysis.
* **Releases API:** Manage deployments and track their impact.
* **Teams API:** Manage teams and user permissions.
* **Organizations API:** Manage Sentry organizations and associated settings.


The Sentry server API typically uses RESTful endpoints and often requires authentication using API tokens.  Consult the official Sentry API documentation for specific endpoints, authentication methods, and detailed usage instructions.  The API documentation details available endpoints, request formats (usually JSON), response formats, and authentication methods.  Remember that the server API may require specific authentication and authorization to access certain endpoints and data.


This API reference provides a brief overview.  For precise details, including request parameters, response structures, error codes, and rate limits, refer to the comprehensive and constantly updated official Sentry documentation.  The documentation usually includes code examples in various programming languages (including Python and Javascript) to demonstrate API usage.


## Appendix

This appendix provides supplemental information to aid in your use of Sentry.

### Glossary of Terms

* **DSN (Data Source Name):** A unique identifier for your Sentry project, used to connect your application to Sentry.  It's essentially a connection string that your application needs to send error reports.

* **Issue:** A grouping of similar error events. Sentry automatically groups similar errors into issues, allowing you to track the frequency and severity of specific problems.

* **Event:** A single instance of an error or other event captured by Sentry.  An issue typically contains multiple events representing similar occurrences.

* **Exception:** An error that occurs during the execution of your application's code.

* **Stack Trace:** A record of the sequence of function calls that led to an exception, showing you the path of execution that resulted in an error.

* **Breadcrumb:** A contextual event captured by Sentry that helps reconstruct the user's actions leading up to an error.  Breadcrumbs provide a "trail" before the error occurred.

* **Transaction:** A unit of work in your application, such as a network request or a user interaction.  Used primarily in performance monitoring.

* **Span:** A sub-segment within a transaction, used for more granular performance monitoring.

* **Release:** A specific version of your application deployed to production or other environments.  Tracking releases allows you to correlate errors with specific deployments.

* **Integration:**  A pre-built module or component that connects Sentry with specific frameworks, libraries, or tools.

* **Sampling Rate:** The percentage of events or transactions that Sentry will sample and send to its servers.  Reducing the sampling rate helps manage data volume.

* **Source Map:** A file that maps minified or obfuscated code back to its original source code, aiding in debugging.


### FAQ

* **What happens if my Sentry subscription expires?**  The free plan offers a good amount of usage. If you exceed the free plan's limits, you may need to upgrade your plan to a paid version to continue using all Sentry features. If you don't upgrade, the service will still collect data but may not have all features available.  You should also check to ensure your retention policy will keep data available if you aren't paying for it.

* **Can I delete my Sentry account?** Yes, you can delete your Sentry account through the account settings.  Be aware that this will permanently delete all of your project data.

* **How do I securely store my DSN?** Store your DSN as an environment variable, not hardcoded in your application code.

* **What is the difference between `captureException` and `captureMessage`?** `captureException` is used to send an exception object, providing detailed information about the error. `captureMessage` is for simpler, text-based error messages.

* **How do I enable performance monitoring?**  Include the `@sentry/tracing` integration when initializing the Sentry SDK and configure the `tracesSampleRate` option.
