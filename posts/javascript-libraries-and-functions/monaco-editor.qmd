## Getting Started

### Installation

The Monaco Editor can be installed via npm or a CDN.  For npm, use:

```bash
npm install monaco-editor
```

This will install the necessary packages.  You'll then need to import it into your project (see Basic Setup).

Alternatively, you can include it via a CDN.  Use a `<script>` tag in your HTML, referencing the appropriate URL from the Monaco Editor release page. Ensure you correctly include the necessary CSS files as well.  This method is simpler for quick prototyping but less ideal for complex projects.


### Basic Setup

After installation via npm, you'll need to import the necessary modules and create the editor instance.  This typically involves:

1. **Importing the required modules:**  This will vary depending on your build system (Webpack, Parcel, etc.), but generally involves an import statement like this:

```javascript
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor';
```

2. **Creating a container element:**  You need a DOM element to host the editor.  This can be a simple `<div>`:

```html
<div id="monaco-editor"></div>
```

3. **Creating the editor instance:** Use the `monaco.editor.create` function, passing the container element and configuration options:

```javascript
const editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById('monaco-editor'), {
    value: '// some code',
    language: 'javascript'
});
```

Remember to adjust the `language` property to match the language you want to support.  Explore the configuration options for more detailed customization (see the API documentation).


### First Example

This example demonstrates a basic setup with JavaScript support:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Monaco Editor Example</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@monaco-editor/core/min/vs/editor/editor.main.min.css">  </head>
<body>
<div id="monaco-editor" style="height: 300px;"></div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@monaco-editor/core/min/vs/loader.js"></script>
<script>
    require.config({ paths: { 'vs': 'https://unpkg.com/@monaco-editor/core/min/vs' }});
    require(['vs/editor/editor.main'], function () {
        const editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById('monaco-editor'), {
            value: 'console.log("Hello, Monaco!");',
            language: 'javascript'
        });
    });
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

This uses a CDN for simplicity. For npm-based setups, replace the `<script>` section with the code from the *Basic Setup* section. Remember to adjust paths if necessary.



### Key Concepts

Understanding these concepts will facilitate efficient usage of the Monaco Editor:

* **`monaco.editor.create()`:** This is the core function for instantiating the editor.  Its arguments define the editor's container, configuration, and initial content.

* **Configuration Options:** Numerous options control the editor's behavior, appearance, and language support. These options are passed as the second argument to `monaco.editor.create()`.  Refer to the API documentation for a complete list.

* **Language Support:**  Monaco supports a wide range of programming languages through language definitions.  You specify the language using the `language` configuration option.

* **Models:**  A model represents the editor's content and associated language information. You can interact with the model directly to perform operations such as modifying the text or retrieving its content.

* **Events:** The editor emits various events that you can listen to for notifications about changes in the editor's state (e.g., content changes, cursor movements).

* **Extensions:** Monaco's functionality can be extended using extensions, which provide additional features like language support, themes, and code actions.

* **API:** The Monaco Editor exposes a comprehensive API for detailed control over its features.  Familiarize yourself with the API documentation to leverage its full capabilities.


## Core API

### Editor Construction

The core of the Monaco Editor API revolves around the `monaco.editor.create` function. This function creates a new editor instance within a specified DOM element.  The function signature is as follows:

```typescript
monaco.editor.create(
    container: HTMLElement, 
    options?: monaco.editor.IEditorConstructionOptions
): monaco.editor.IStandaloneCodeEditor;
```

* `container`:  An HTML element (typically a `<div>`) that will host the editor.  The editor will fill its parent's dimensions.

* `options`:  An optional object containing various configuration options (see Configuration Options below).  This object allows detailed customization of the editor's appearance and behavior.

The function returns an `IStandaloneCodeEditor` object, which provides methods to interact with the editor.


### Configuration Options

The `options` parameter in `monaco.editor.create` accepts a wide range of configuration options.  Key options include:

* `value`: (string) The initial content of the editor.

* `language`: (string) The initial programming language of the editor.  This determines syntax highlighting and other language-specific features. Examples include `javascript`, `python`, `java`, `typescript`, etc.

* `theme`: (string)  The theme to use for the editor.  See the available themes in the Monaco Editor documentation.  Default is usually `vs`.

* `automaticLayout`: (boolean)  Whether the editor should automatically resize itself to fill its container.  Default is `true`.

* `readOnly`: (boolean)  Whether the editor should be read-only.  Default is `false`.

* `lineNumbers`: (string | 'off') Controls the visibility and style of line numbers.  Can be `'on'`, `'off'`, or `'relative'`.

Many other options control features like word wrapping, minimap visibility, line height, font size, and more.  Consult the official API documentation for a comprehensive list and descriptions.


### Model Manipulation

The editor's content is managed through a `monaco.editor.ITextModel` object. You can access the model through the `getModel()` method of the `IStandaloneCodeEditor` instance.  Key model manipulation methods include:

* `getValue()`: Returns the complete text content of the model.

* `setValue(newValue: string)`: Replaces the entire content of the model with the provided string.

* `getLineContent(lineNumber: number)`: Retrieves the content of a specific line.

* `deltaDecorations(oldDecorations: string[], newDecorations: ITextModelDecoration[]): string[]`:  Add, remove, or update decorations (highlights, annotations) in the editor.

* `pushEditStack(editOperations: ITextModelEdit[]): void`: Push a set of edits onto the undo stack.


### View Management

The editor's view manages the visual representation of the model.  Methods related to view management include:

* `revealLine(lineNumber: number, scrollType?: ScrollType)`: Scrolls the editor to make a specific line visible.  `scrollType` can be `'smooth'` or `'immediate'`.

* `revealLineInCenter(lineNumber: number, scrollType?: ScrollType)`: Scrolls the editor to center the specified line.

* `setScrollTop(newScrollTop: number)`: Manually sets the vertical scroll position.

* `setScrollLeft(newScrollLeft: number)`: Manually sets the horizontal scroll position.

* `layout()`:  Forces the editor to re-layout itself, which is useful after changes to its container's dimensions.

These methods provide fine-grained control over the editor's visual presentation.


### Event Handling

The Monaco Editor provides an event system for tracking changes and user interactions.  You can listen to events such as:

* `'change'`: Fired whenever the editor's content changes.

* `'focus'`: Fired when the editor gains focus.

* `'blur'`: Fired when the editor loses focus.

* `'mouseDown'`, `'mouseUp'`, `'contextMenu'`: Mouse events within the editor.

* `'selectionChange'`: Fired when the selection in the editor changes.

Event listeners are attached using the `on` method of the `IStandaloneCodeEditor` instance:

```typescript
editor.onDidChangeModelContent(e => {
    console.log("Content Changed:", e);
});
```


### Commands

The Monaco Editor supports a set of predefined commands that you can execute programmatically. Examples include:

* `'editor.action.formatDocument'`: Formats the entire document.

* `'editor.action.undo'`: Undoes the last edit.

* `'editor.action.redo'`: Redoes the last undone edit.

* `'editor.action.selectAll'`: Selects all text in the editor.

Commands are executed using the `executeCommand` method:

```typescript
editor.trigger('myCustomTrigger', 'editor.action.formatDocument');
```

or using the keybindings directly via `editor.focus()` combined with keyboard input.  Consult the API documentation for a complete list of available commands.


## Language Support

### Language Configuration

Monaco Editor's language support is primarily configured through language definitions.  These definitions specify the syntax rules, keywords, and other language-specific features needed for accurate syntax highlighting, code completion, and other language-aware functionalities.  Many common languages are built-in, but you can also create custom language definitions (see Custom Language Definition).  The core components of a language definition include:

* **`language`**: A unique identifier for the language (e.g., "javascript", "python").

* **`aliases`**:  Alternative names or abbreviations for the language.

* **`keywords`**:  A list of keywords in the language.

* **`symbols`**:  A list of symbols and operators.

* **`tokenizer`**:  A function that breaks down the code into tokens, which are then used for syntax highlighting.


### Monolingual Support

Supporting a single language is straightforward.  When creating the editor, simply specify the `language` option:

```javascript
const editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById('editor'), {
    value: '// Some JavaScript code',
    language: 'javascript'
});
```

Monaco will automatically load the necessary language definition and apply appropriate syntax highlighting.


### Multilingual Support

Monaco Editor seamlessly handles multiple languages within a single document (though features like code completion might be less effective in this scenario).  You can achieve this by dynamically changing the language associated with the model, or by using language constructs within a single document that are correctly interpreted based on context.

For example, you could switch languages using:

```javascript
const model = editor.getModel();
monaco.editor.setModelLanguage(model, 'typescript'); //or any other supported language
```

However, remember that this will re-tokenize the entire model which may impact performance for very large files.


### Custom Language Definition

To support a language not natively supported by Monaco, you need to create a custom language definition.  This involves defining a language configuration object according to Monaco's specification and registering it.  The structure of a custom language definition is quite intricate; refer to the official Monaco Editor documentation for a detailed description of the required fields and their meaning.

Once you have the language definition, register it using:

```javascript
monaco.languages.register({
    id: 'myCustomLanguage', // Unique ID
    extensions: ['.mylang'], // File extensions
    aliases: ['My Custom Language'], // Names
    // ... other configuration options from the language definition ...
});
```

After registration, you can use the new language in `monaco.editor.create()`.


### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down code into individual units (tokens) with semantic meaning.  In Monaco, this is crucial for syntax highlighting.  Custom language definitions require a `tokenizer` function that performs this task.  The tokenizer receives the code as input and returns an array of tokens, each with a type that maps to a specific style in your theme.

For example, a token might be classified as a `keyword`, `identifier`, `number`, `string`, or `comment`. Monaco uses these classifications to apply the appropriate styling based on your theme.


### Semantic Highlighting

While basic syntax highlighting is usually done through the tokenizer, more sophisticated highlighting, often reflecting deeper semantic understanding of the code, may require custom extension development.  This can include advanced features like:

* **Type highlighting**:  Displaying the type of variables or expressions in a different color.

* **Error highlighting**:  Highlighting syntax or semantic errors.

* **Reference highlighting**:  Highlighting all occurrences of a selected identifier.

These features often involve analyzing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the code, which often requires more extensive language-specific logic beyond the basic tokenizer.  You might leverage existing parsing tools (like those built into TypeScript or other compilers) or build your own.  Usually, this level of highlighting would be implemented as a custom Monaco extension.


## Advanced Features

### Code Completion

Code completion, also known as IntelliSense, provides suggestions for code as the user types.  Monaco's code completion is language-aware, drawing information from the language definition and potentially from external sources (like a language server protocol (LSP) server for more advanced features).  It is enabled by default for supported languages and can be customized through configuration options.  Completion items can be customized to show types, descriptions and additional metadata.


### Code Suggestions

Similar to code completion, code suggestions offer contextual recommendations for code.  While completion typically focuses on completing partial identifiers, suggestions provide broader hints and potential code snippets.  Many aspects of suggestions are language-specific and dependent on the language server or the language definition.


### Hovering

Hovering the mouse over a symbol or keyword often displays a tooltip with more information about it.  This usually includes type information, documentation comments, or other relevant details.  The content of the hover is dependent on the language and any available language server.


### Signature Help

Signature help displays information about a function's parameters and their types as the user types within a function call.  This is particularly useful for understanding the expected arguments and their order.


### Parameter Hints

Parameter hints are displayed inside the function call, showing the name and type of each parameter.  This assists in providing a quick visual reference for the arguments in a function call.


### Folding

Code folding allows users to collapse or expand sections of code, improving readability and reducing visual clutter for large files.  Monaco provides controls for folding and unfolding code blocks, typically based on syntax structure like functions, classes, or code blocks.


### Go to Definition

This feature allows users to quickly navigate to the definition of a symbol (variable, function, class) by clicking or right-clicking on the symbol and selecting "Go to Definition". It requires language support and may rely on a language server for more accurate results.


### Find and Replace

Monaco provides standard find and replace functionality, allowing users to search for text within the editor and replace it with other text.  This includes options for case-sensitivity, regular expressions, and whole-word matching.


### Debugging

While Monaco itself isn't a debugger, it provides an excellent foundation for integrating with external debugging tools.  You can use Monaco to display the source code and integrate breakpoints, stepping, and other debugging functionalities through a separate debugger extension or backend.


### Code Actions

Code actions (also known as "quick fixes") provide suggestions for resolving code issues or improving code style.  These actions might include fixing linting errors, adding imports, or suggesting refactoring changes.  Code actions are often language and context-specific and are frequently powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server.


### Refactoring

Refactoring tools provide advanced capabilities for restructuring code without changing its functionality.  This can include actions like renaming variables, extracting methods, or moving code blocks.  These capabilities usually depend on an LSP server and its ability to understand the semantics of your code.


### Code Formatting

Code formatting automatically adjusts the code's layout to adhere to a specific style guide.  Monaco supports various formatting styles, and you can customize the formatter using a configuration file or through extension integration.  Formatting often relies on an external formatting tool or an LSP server.


### Snippets

Snippets are reusable code templates that can be inserted into the editor.  You can define custom snippets to quickly add commonly used code blocks or patterns.  Monaco has support for easily defining and inserting these templates.


### Emmet Support

Emmet is a powerful tool for rapid HTML, CSS, and XML coding.  Monaco provides integrated support for Emmet, enabling users to write abbreviated code snippets that are expanded into full HTML, CSS, or other markup structures.


### Diff Editor

Monaco supports the creation of a diff editor, which displays the differences between two versions of a file or code.  This feature is highly useful for comparing and reviewing changes.


### Multiple Editors

You can create and manage multiple Monaco editor instances within a single application.  Each instance will have its own model and configuration, allowing for independent management of different code files or sections.


### Accessibility

Monaco Editor strives to be accessible to users with disabilities.  This includes support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.  Consult the documentation for specific accessibility features and best practices when integrating Monaco into your application to ensure proper accessibility.



## Themes and Customization

### Built-in Themes

Monaco Editor provides several built-in themes that alter the visual appearance of the editor.  These themes change the colors of syntax highlighting, background, and other UI elements.  Common built-in themes include `vs`, `vs-dark`, and `hc-black`.  To use a built-in theme, specify the theme name in the `theme` option when creating the editor:

```javascript
const editor = monaco.editor.create(container, {
    theme: 'vs-dark'
});
```

The availability of built-in themes might change between versions; check the Monaco Editor release notes for the most up-to-date list.


### Custom Themes

Beyond the built-in themes, you can create and use custom themes to tailor the editor's appearance to your preferences or branding.  Custom themes allow for granular control over colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.


### Theme Definition

A custom theme is defined as a JSON file that specifies the colors and styles for various editor elements.  The structure of a theme definition file is quite detailed and follows a specific format. The structure includes rules that specify which parts of the editor (e.g., keywords, comments, strings, background, etc.) should have which colors. The format is documented in the Monaco Editor's API documentation. The file should usually be placed in a location accessible by your web application, and then be referenced when initializing the editor.

Once you create the theme definition file (e.g., `myTheme.json`), you register and use it as follows:

```javascript
monaco.editor.defineTheme('myTheme', {
    base: 'vs', // Base theme to inherit from (optional)
    inherit: true, // Inherit from base theme (optional)
    rules: [
        // Color rules for various elements
        { token: 'keyword', foreground: 'FF0000' }, // Example: Red keywords
        { token: 'comment', foreground: '008000' }  // Example: Green comments
        // ...more rules
    ],
    colors: { // Override base theme colors
        'editor.background': '#F0F0F0' // Example: Light gray background
        // ...more color overrides
    }
});

const editor = monaco.editor.create(container, {
    theme: 'myTheme'
});
```


### Font Customization

You can customize the font used in the editor, affecting the appearance of code and other text. This is often done indirectly by configuring the CSS applied to the editor or by setting the `fontFamily` property in the editor's options:

```javascript
const editor = monaco.editor.create(container, {
    fontFamily: 'Consolas, monospace'
});
```

Note that this affects only the editor's content; other elements might need separate CSS rules.


### Color Customization

Color customization provides fine-grained control over various aspects of the editor's appearance.  Beyond theme definitions, you can sometimes adjust specific colors directly using the `editor.getColorTheme().getColor()` API. However, this is generally less flexible than using custom themes. Modifying colors directly might impact the overall consistency of the theme.


### UI Customization

UI customization goes beyond simple theme adjustments.  It involves modifying aspects of the editor's layout and widgets (e.g., line numbers, scrollbars, minimap, etc.).   This often involves using CSS or creating custom extensions to modify the underlying HTML structure of the editor. While CSS can adjust sizes and appearances, some deep modifications of the user interface (such as adding new widgets or modifying existing ones) require extensive knowledge of the editor's internal structure and may need custom extensions.  Direct modification of the editor's internal structure is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it might be broken by subsequent updates to the Monaco Editor.


## Plugins and Extensions

### Plugin Development

Monaco Editor's extensibility is a key feature.  You can enhance its functionality by developing plugins or extensions.  Plugins typically add new features, while extensions might modify existing behavior or integrate external services.  Plugin development involves creating JavaScript modules that interact with the Monaco Editor API.  These modules are then loaded and registered with the editor, making their features available.  The development process often involves understanding the editor's API, registering plugin contributions at specific extension points, and handling events.


### Plugin Architecture

Monaco Editor's plugin architecture is based on a loosely coupled design. Plugins register their contributions at specific extension points, making their functionality available to the editor without direct dependencies between plugins.  This modular design promotes flexibility and allows independent development and maintenance of plugins.  A common structure involves defining a plugin's contributions and registering them using the appropriate Monaco API functions.  The plugin's code will then be triggered by user interactions or specific events within the editor.


### Plugin Management

Managing plugins involves loading, registering, and unregistering them.  This usually happens during the initialization phase of your application.  You might load plugins from various sources (local files, remote URLs, or npm packages).  The Monaco Editor API provides functions to register and unregister plugin contributions, ensuring proper integration with the editor’s core functionality.  If your application manages multiple plugins, careful organization is crucial to avoid conflicts and to manage dependencies.


### Extension Points

Extension points are specific locations within the Monaco Editor's architecture where plugins can contribute functionality.  These points are well-defined areas where plugins can register their contributions, such as adding new commands, language support, themes, code actions, and more.  Each extension point has a specific API that defines how plugins can contribute to that point.  By adhering to the defined API, plugins ensure seamless integration with the editor.  Understanding the available extension points is critical for developing effective plugins.  The documentation lists the extension points and their associated APIs.


### API for Plugins

The API for plugins provides the necessary functions and methods for interacting with the Monaco Editor.  This API allows plugins to access and manipulate the editor's internal state, register contributions to extension points, respond to events, and extend the editor's core functionality.  The API is comprehensive, covering various aspects of the editor, from basic text manipulation to advanced features such as code completion and debugging.  The API documentation is essential for plugin developers, providing details about each function, its parameters, return values, and potential exceptions.  Proper use of the API is critical for creating stable and efficient plugins.


## Performance Optimization

### Large File Handling

Handling large files efficiently is crucial for a smooth user experience.  Monaco Editor employs several strategies to optimize performance with large files, but additional measures might be necessary depending on your specific needs and the size of the files.  Key strategies include:

* **Diffing:**  When loading or updating large files, use diffing algorithms to identify and update only the changed parts of the document instead of reloading the entire content.

* **Virtualization:**  For extremely large files that exceed available memory, implement virtualization techniques to render only the visible portion of the document.  Monaco itself doesn't automatically virtualize, so you'll need to handle this aspect in your application.

* **Lazy Loading:**  Delay loading of non-essential parts of the file until they're needed.  This could involve loading only a subset of the file initially, and then loading additional parts as the user scrolls or navigates through the code.

* **Model Decoration Management:**  Avoid using excessive decorations (highlights, annotations, etc.) on very large files.  Too many decorations can significantly slow down rendering and potentially freeze the editor.


### Performance Tips

Several general best practices can significantly improve Monaco Editor's performance:

* **Minimize Decorations:** As mentioned above, decorations can have a large impact.  Use them sparingly and remove unnecessary ones when they're no longer needed.

* **Efficient Event Handling:** Avoid long-running operations within event handlers (like `onDidChangeModelContent`).  These handlers are triggered frequently, and lengthy processes can cause noticeable delays or freezes.  Offload heavy tasks to Web Workers if possible.

* **Avoid Frequent Updates:**  Reduce the frequency of model updates.  Batch multiple changes into a single update whenever possible to minimize rendering overhead.

* **Optimize Configuration:** Carefully configure the editor's options to balance features and performance.  Disabling or limiting features like the minimap or line numbers might improve performance, especially with very large files.

* **Use Appropriate Data Structures:**  Choose appropriate data structures for managing large amounts of data to optimize access times and memory usage.

* **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading (Application-Level):** If you are using a bundler (like Webpack), consider code splitting to load only the necessary parts of your application initially, and lazy load Monaco Editor and its dependencies.


### Memory Management

Careful memory management is critical when dealing with large files or complex projects.

* **Garbage Collection:**  Ensure that your application allows the JavaScript garbage collector to run efficiently.  Avoid creating unnecessary closures or circular references that prevent garbage collection from reclaiming memory.

* **Resource Release:**  Explicitly release resources when they're no longer needed.  This might involve dereferencing objects or removing event listeners.

* **Monitoring Memory Usage:** Use browser developer tools to monitor memory consumption and identify potential memory leaks.


### Rendering Optimization

Rendering performance can be improved by:

* **Reduce DOM Manipulation:** Minimize direct manipulation of the DOM.  The editor handles rendering internally, and excessive direct DOM updates can conflict with its internal rendering process and impact performance.

* **Utilize Browser Capabilities:** Leverage browser capabilities like hardware acceleration where possible.

* **Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders:** Ensure that only necessary parts of the editor are re-rendered when changes occur.  Avoid unnecessary updates that trigger full re-renders of the editor.




## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

This section addresses some frequently encountered issues when working with the Monaco Editor:

* **Editor not rendering:** Ensure that the container element exists in the DOM and has appropriate dimensions. Check your CSS to make sure no styles are preventing the editor from being displayed. Double-check that the necessary Monaco Editor scripts and stylesheets are correctly included and loaded.

* **Incorrect syntax highlighting:** Verify that the `language` option is correctly set to match the actual language of the code.  If using a custom language, ensure it's properly defined and registered.  Check for potential issues in the language definition itself.

* **Performance issues:**  For large files, implement the performance optimization strategies described in the "Performance Optimization" section.  Profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks.

* **Missing features:** Check if the required features are enabled in the editor configuration or if any necessary plugins or extensions are installed and correctly configured.

* **Unexpected behavior:** Carefully review your code to ensure that you are using the Monaco Editor API correctly. Consult the API documentation for the correct usage of functions and methods.


### Error Handling

Robust error handling is essential for building stable applications. When integrating Monaco, consider these error-handling strategies:

* **Try-Catch Blocks:** Wrap potentially problematic code within `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent your application from crashing.

* **Logging:**  Use logging mechanisms to record errors and relevant information.  This can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting issues in production.  Consider using a structured logging format for easier analysis.

* **Error Reporting:** Implement mechanisms to report errors to a central location (e.g., error tracking service) for easier monitoring and analysis.  Include relevant context information (like the version of Monaco Editor, browser information, and user actions).

* **Graceful Degradation:**  Design your application to gracefully handle situations where the Monaco Editor might fail to load or function correctly.  Provide fallback mechanisms or alternative ways for users to interact with the content.


### Debugging Tips

Debugging Monaco Editor integrations involves a combination of techniques:

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the DOM, network requests, and JavaScript console. This helps to pinpoint issues in your application's code or Monaco Editor's behavior.

* **Console Logging:** Strategically place `console.log` statements in your code to track the flow of execution and inspect variable values.  Log relevant data to help understand the sequence of events leading to the issue.

* **Breakpoints:** Use your debugger to set breakpoints in your code to step through the execution, inspect variables, and pinpoint the source of errors.

* **Network Monitoring:**  Monitor network requests to ensure that Monaco Editor's resources (scripts, styles, language definitions) are loaded correctly.  Check for any errors or delays in loading.

* **Monaco Editor API Documentation:** Refer to the official Monaco Editor API documentation for details on function parameters, return values, and expected behavior.  Compare your code to the examples provided in the documentation.

* **Simplify and Isolate:**  If faced with complex issues, try to simplify your code or isolate the problematic parts to create a minimal reproducible example.  This helps focus on the core problem.
