{"title":"SizzleJS - Documentation","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"SizzleJS - Documentation","categories":["JavaScript Libraries and Functions"]},"headingText":"What is SizzleJS?","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n\nSizzleJS is a powerful, fast, and widely-used CSS selector engine.  It's a standalone library that parses CSS selectors (like those you'd use in jQuery's `$()` function) and returns a list of matching DOM elements.  While often associated with jQuery, Sizzle is independent and can be used in any JavaScript project that needs robust selector functionality.  It efficiently handles complex selectors, including those with pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, providing a consistent and predictable way to traverse and manipulate the DOM.\n\n### Why use SizzleJS?\n\n* **Speed and Efficiency:** Sizzle is optimized for performance, offering fast selection even on large or complex DOM structures.  Its efficient parsing and traversal algorithms contribute to its speed advantage.\n\n* **Standards Compliance:** Sizzle aims for compliance with the CSS selector specifications, ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers and versions.\n\n* **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Sizzle can be easily integrated into various projects and extended with custom selectors if needed. Its modular design makes it adaptable to different environments.\n\n* **Widely Used and Tested:** Its widespread use in jQuery and other projects means it's a well-tested and reliable library, with a proven track record of stability and performance.  This also translates to easier debugging and readily available resources for support.\n\n* **Standalone Library:**  It doesn't require other libraries to function, offering a lightweight and independent solution for DOM manipulation.\n\n### SizzleJS vs. Other Selectors\n\nSeveral other JavaScript libraries provide selector functionality, but Sizzle distinguishes itself through its speed, robustness, and wide adoption.  Native browser querySelectorAll is often a good alternative for simple selectors, offering good performance in modern browsers. However, Sizzle often surpasses native selectors in terms of speed and handling of complex selectors, especially in older browsers.  Other selector engines might lack Sizzle's extensive testing, community support, and consistent cross-browser performance.\n\n### Setting up SizzleJS\n\nSizzleJS is typically included via a script tag in your HTML file.  You can download the minified version from the official repository (link would go here if this were a real manual) and include it as follows:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/sizzle.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nReplace `\"path/to/sizzle.min.js\"` with the actual path to the downloaded SizzleJS file.  After inclusion, the `Sizzle` function is available globally.  To use it, you'll typically pass a CSS selector string and a context (optional, defaults to the document):\n\n```javascript\nvar elements = Sizzle('div.myClass', document.getElementById('myContainer'));\n//elements now contains an array-like object of matching elements.\n\n//Example without a context (searches the entire document):\nvar allParagraphs = Sizzle('p');\n```\n\nThis provides the foundation for using SizzleJS in your projects.  Further documentation on using its advanced features would be covered in subsequent sections.\n\n\n## Selectors\n\n### Basic Selectors\n\nSizzle supports all standard CSS basic selectors:\n\n* **Element Selectors:** Select elements based on their tag name.  For example, `div`, `p`, `span`, etc.  `Sizzle('p')` selects all paragraph elements.\n\n* **Class Selectors:** Select elements with a specific class.  Use a dot (`.`) before the class name.  For example, `.myClass` selects all elements with the class \"myClass\". `Sizzle('.myClass')` selects all elements with that class.\n\n* **ID Selectors:** Select elements with a specific ID. Use a hash (#) before the ID name.  For example, `#myElement` selects the element with the ID \"myElement\".  `Sizzle('#myElement')` selects the element with that ID.  Note that IDs should be unique within a document; Sizzle will only return the first match if duplicates exist.\n\n\n### Attribute Selectors\n\nSizzle supports various attribute selectors:\n\n* **`[attribute]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute, regardless of its value.  `Sizzle('[title]')` selects all elements with a `title` attribute.\n\n* **`[attribute=value]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute and value. `Sizzle('[href=\"http://example.com\"]')` selects all elements with an `href` attribute equal to \"http://example.com\".\n\n* **`[attribute!=value]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute and a value that is *not* equal to the specified value. `Sizzle('[lang!=\"en\"]')` selects all elements whose `lang` attribute is not \"en\".\n\n* **`[attribute^=value]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value begins with the specified value. `Sizzle('[id^=\"prefix\"]')` selects elements whose ID starts with \"prefix\".\n\n* **`[attribute$=value]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value ends with the specified value. `Sizzle('[class$=\"suffix\"]')` selects elements whose class ends with \"suffix\".\n\n* **`[attribute*=value]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value contains the specified value. `Sizzle('[title*=\"keyword\"]')` selects elements whose `title` attribute contains \"keyword\".\n\n* **`[attribute~=value]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words containing the specified value. `Sizzle('[class~=highlight]')` selects elements whose `class` attribute includes \"highlight\" as one of its space-separated values.\n\n* **`[attribute|=value]`:** Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value is either exactly the specified value or begins with the specified value followed by a hyphen. This is useful for language codes. `Sizzle('[lang|=en]')` selects elements whose `lang` attribute is \"en\" or starts with \"en-\".\n\n\n### Pseudo-classes\n\nSizzle supports a wide range of CSS pseudo-classes, including but not limited to:\n\n* `:first-child`, `:last-child`, `:nth-child(n)`, `:nth-last-child(n)`: Select elements based on their position among their siblings.\n\n* `:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type`, `:nth-of-type(n)`, `:nth-last-of-type(n)`: Similar to the above, but considers only siblings of the same element type.\n\n* `:only-child`, `:only-of-type`: Selects elements that are the only child or only child of their type, respectively.\n\n* `:empty`: Selects elements that have no children.\n\n* `:checked`: Selects checked checkboxes, radio buttons, and options in `<select>` elements.\n\n* `:enabled`, `:disabled`: Selects enabled or disabled form elements.\n\n* `:focus`: Selects the element that currently has focus.  Note that this is dynamic and requires the element to actually have focus.\n\n* `:hover` (context-dependent): In some contexts, Sizzle might support `:hover`, but it's usually not directly applicable within a standard Sizzle call.\n\n* `:root`: Selects the root element of the document.\n\nConsult the full CSS specification for a complete list and their functionalities.\n\n\n### Pseudo-elements\n\nSizzle supports the standard CSS pseudo-elements:\n\n* `::before`, `::after`:  These are generally not directly manipulable through Sizzle as they represent generated content, not actual elements in the DOM.  They're more relevant in styling with CSS.\n\n\n### Combinators\n\nSizzle supports the following CSS combinators:\n\n* **Descendant combinator (` `):** Selects all descendants of the preceding element.  `Sizzle('div p')` selects all `<p>` elements that are descendants of any `<div>` element.\n\n* **Child combinator (`>`):** Selects all direct children of the preceding element. `Sizzle('div > p')` selects only the `<p>` elements that are direct children of `<div>` elements.\n\n* **Adjacent sibling combinator (`+`):** Selects the immediately following sibling of the preceding element. `Sizzle('h1 + p')` selects the first `<p>` element that immediately follows an `<h1>` element.\n\n* **General sibling combinator (`~`):** Selects all following siblings of the preceding element. `Sizzle('h1 ~ p')` selects all `<p>` elements that follow an `<h1>` element.\n\n\n### Filtering Selectors\n\nWhile not strictly separate selectors, the use of pseudo-classes and combinators allows for powerful filtering of selected elements. The examples above demonstrate this capability.\n\n\n### Escaping Special Characters\n\nIf your selector needs to include characters that have special meaning in CSS selectors (e.g., `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `.`, `#`, `*`, `+`, `>`, `~`, etc.), you need to escape them with two backslashes (`\\\\`). For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar elements = Sizzle('[id=\\\\#my-special-id]'); // Selects element with id \"#my-special-id\"\n```\n\nThis ensures that these characters are treated as literal characters and not as special selector syntax.  Escaping is only necessary when these characters are part of a value, not the selector name itself (e.g., escaping `.` in `.myClass` is not required, but escaping `.` in `[attribute=.value]` is).\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `sizzle(selector, context)`\n\nThis is the primary function of SizzleJS. It takes a CSS selector string and an optional context element as arguments.\n\n* **`selector` (String):**  The CSS selector string to match against.  This is the core of what Sizzle parses and uses to find elements.\n\n* **`context` (Element, optional):**  The element within which to search for matching elements.  If omitted, the entire document (`document`) is used as the context.\n\n**Return Value:** An array-like object (a `NodeList` in most browsers) containing the matching DOM elements.  If no matches are found, an empty array-like object is returned.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar paragraphs = Sizzle('p', document.getElementById('myDiv')); // Selects all <p> elements within #myDiv\nvar allDivs = Sizzle('div'); // Selects all <div> elements in the document\n```\n\n### `sizzle.matches(element, selector)`\n\nThis function checks if a given element matches a specific selector.\n\n* **`element` (Element):** The DOM element to test.\n\n* **`selector` (String):** The CSS selector string to match against.\n\n**Return Value:** `true` if the element matches the selector, `false` otherwise.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar myDiv = document.getElementById('myDiv');\nif (sizzle.matches('.myClass', myDiv)) {\n  console.log(\"The div has the class 'myClass'\");\n}\n```\n\n### `sizzle.contains(container, contained)`\n\nThis function checks if a container element contains another element.  It handles different browser quirks and edge cases related to containment.\n\n* **`container` (Element):** The potential parent element.\n\n* **`contained` (Element):** The element that might be contained within the container.\n\n**Return Value:** `true` if the `container` element contains the `contained` element, `false` otherwise.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar parent = document.getElementById('parent');\nvar child = document.getElementById('child');\nif (sizzle.contains(parent, child)) {\n    console.log(\"The parent contains the child.\");\n}\n```\n\n### `sizzle.uniq(results)`\n\nThis is an internal helper function used by Sizzle to remove duplicate elements from a result set. It's not typically called directly by developers.  The implementation details are internal to Sizzle's operation.\n\n\n### `sizzle.expr`\n\nThis object contains the core expression parsing engine of Sizzle. It defines the grammar and rules for interpreting CSS selectors.  It's an internal object and generally not directly used or modified by developers.\n\n\n### `sizzle.selectors`\n\nThis object contains the definitions of various CSS selectors understood by Sizzle. This is also an internal object used for the parsing process.  Direct manipulation is generally not recommended or necessary for standard usage.\n\n\n### `sizzle.relative`\n\nThis object holds the logic for handling relative selectors (combinators like `>`, `+`, `~`, and the descendant combinator space).  It's an internal component of Sizzle's selector engine, and direct interaction is usually unnecessary for common use cases.  The details are implementation-specific to the engine.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Optimizing SizzleJS Performance\n\nWhile SizzleJS is already highly optimized, several strategies can further enhance its performance, particularly when dealing with large or complex DOM structures:\n\n* **Reduce Selector Complexity:**  Avoid overly complex selectors.  Simple, specific selectors are generally faster than convoluted ones.  If possible, break down complex selections into smaller, more focused ones.\n\n* **Use IDs When Possible:**  ID selectors (`#id`) are the fastest because IDs must be unique within a document.  If you have IDs available, prioritize them over class or element selectors.\n\n* **Limit Context:**  When using the `context` argument in `Sizzle()`, restrict the context to the smallest possible portion of the DOM. Searching within a smaller subtree significantly improves speed.\n\n* **Caching Results:** If you repeatedly select the same elements, cache the results of the `Sizzle()` call to avoid redundant processing.  Store the results in a variable and reuse them.\n\n* **Minimize DOM Manipulation:**  Excessive DOM manipulation within a loop that uses Sizzle can degrade performance.  Try to batch DOM changes to minimize reflows and repaints.\n\n* **Avoid Unnecessary Selectors:**  If you're performing multiple selections from a subset of already-selected elements, consider using array methods (like `.filter()`) on the initial selection instead of repeatedly calling `Sizzle()`.\n\n* **Consider Native `querySelectorAll`:** For simple selectors and modern browsers, the native `querySelectorAll()` method can sometimes be faster than Sizzle.  Benchmark your specific use case to determine if this is a worthwhile optimization.\n\n\n### Extending SizzleJS with Custom Selectors\n\nSizzleJS allows extending its selector engine by adding custom pseudo-selectors or other custom functionality.  This is typically done by modifying the `sizzle.selectors` object, although the exact method may change across versions.  The specifics are typically implementation dependent and could require careful examination of the SizzleJS source code.  The best approach is always to check the latest documentation or examples if available from the project's official resources.\n\n\n### Using SizzleJS with Other Libraries\n\nSizzleJS is designed to be a standalone library.  It can be easily integrated with other JavaScript frameworks or libraries.  Simply include the SizzleJS script in your HTML file before including other scripts that depend on it.  Ensure that there are no naming conflicts with other libraries.  You can then use the `Sizzle()` function directly.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n* **No Results:** Double-check your selector for typos and ensure that the elements you're targeting actually exist in the DOM at the time the selector is executed. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the DOM structure and verify your selectors.\n\n* **Unexpected Results:** Verify the context you're using with `Sizzle()`. Incorrect context will lead to unexpected matches.  Ensure that your selectors are correctly reflecting the desired elements and their relationships (parent-child, siblings, etc.).\n\n* **Performance Problems:** See the \"Optimizing SizzleJS Performance\" section above.\n\n* **Browser Compatibility:** While Sizzle strives for broad compatibility, very old or unusual browsers might have edge cases. Test across different browsers and versions to ensure compatibility.\n\n* **Selector Errors:**  Invalid CSS selectors will generally either not find any elements or trigger JavaScript errors.  Carefully review the CSS selector specification for correct syntax.\n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Selector Examples\n\nThese examples demonstrate simple selector usage:\n\n```javascript\n// Select all paragraph elements\nvar paragraphs = Sizzle('p');\n\n// Select all elements with the class \"highlight\"\nvar highlightedElements = Sizzle('.highlight');\n\n// Select the element with the ID \"myElement\"\nvar myElement = Sizzle('#myElement')[0]; // [0] accesses the first (and only) element\n\n// Select all divs that are direct children of the body\nvar directDivs = Sizzle('body > div');\n\n//Select all list items within an unordered list.\nvar listItems = Sizzle('ul > li');\n```\n\n\n### Complex Selector Examples\n\nThese examples showcase more sophisticated selector combinations:\n\n```javascript\n// Select all <p> elements that are descendants of a <div> with the class \"container\"\nvar paragraphsInContainer = Sizzle('div.container p');\n\n// Select the first <li> element that is a child of an <ul> element with the class \"menu\"\nvar firstMenuItem = Sizzle('ul.menu > li:first-child')[0];\n\n// Select all inputs of type checkbox that are checked\nvar checkedCheckboxes = Sizzle('input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked');\n\n//Select all elements with the attribute data-test and that contains the value \"example\".\nvar dataTestElements = Sizzle('[data-test*=\"example\"]');\n\n//Select all list items that have the class \"active\" and are also descendants of a ul with the id \"myList\".\nvar activeListItems = Sizzle('#myList ul li.active');\n\n\n```\n\n### Practical Use Cases\n\nSizzleJS is versatile and applicable in various scenarios:\n\n* **DOM Manipulation:**  Select elements for modification, addition, removal, or styling.\n\n* **Form Handling:**  Identify and interact with specific form elements (e.g., checkboxes, radio buttons, text inputs).\n\n* **Dynamic Content Updates:**  Select elements to update after AJAX requests or other asynchronous operations.\n\n* **Creating Custom Widgets or Plugins:**  Use SizzleJS to select and manipulate elements within custom components.\n\n* **Testing Frameworks:**  Select specific elements for testing purposes.\n\n* **Data Extraction:** Select elements and extract their data for processing or display.\n\n\n### Code Examples with Explanations\n\nLet's illustrate practical usage:\n\n**Example 1: Hiding elements on click:**\n\n```javascript\n// Add an event listener to a button\ndocument.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {\n  // Select all elements with the class \"hideable\" using Sizzle\n  var elementsToHide = Sizzle('.hideable');\n\n  // Iterate over the selected elements and set their display style to \"none\"\n  for (var i = 0; i < elementsToHide.length; i++) {\n    elementsToHide[i].style.display = 'none';\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Example 2:  Adding a class to matched elements:**\n\n```javascript\n// Select all images within a specific div using Sizzle and add a class.\nvar images = Sizzle('#imageContainer img');\nfor (let i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {\n  images[i].classList.add('bordered');\n}\n```\n\n**Example 3:  Filtering Elements**\n\n```javascript\n// Select all list items, then filter them to keep only the ones with the class \"selected\".\nconst listItems = Sizzle('li');\nconst selectedItems = Array.from(listItems).filter(item => item.classList.contains('selected'));\nconsole.log(selectedItems);\n```\n\nThese examples show how SizzleJS's selector power simplifies DOM manipulation and enables efficient interaction with web page elements. Remember to replace placeholder IDs and classes with your actual element identifiers.\n\n\n## Contributing to SizzleJS\n\nThis section outlines the process for contributing to the SizzleJS project.

If no matches are found, an empty array-like object is returned.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar paragraphs = Sizzle('p', document.getElementById('myDiv')); // Selects all <p> elements within #myDiv\nvar allDivs = Sizzle('div'); // Selects all <div> elements in the document\n```\n\n### `sizzle.matches(element, selector)`\n\nThis function checks if a given element matches a specific selector.\n\n* **`element` (Element):** The DOM element to test.\n\n* **`selector` (String):** The CSS selector string to match against.\n\n**Return Value:** `true` if the element matches the selector, `false` otherwise.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar myDiv = document.getElementById('myDiv');\nif (sizzle.matches('.myClass', myDiv)) {\n  console.log(\"The div has the class 'myClass'\");\n}\n```\n\n### `sizzle.contains(container, contained)`\n\nThis function checks if a container element contains another element.  It handles different browser quirks and edge cases related to containment.\n\n* **`container` (Element):** The potential parent element.\n\n* **`contained` (Element):** The element that might be contained within the container.\n\n**Return Value:** `true` if the `container` element contains the `contained` element, `false` otherwise.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar parent = document.getElementById('parent');\nvar child = document.getElementById('child');\nif (sizzle.contains(parent, child)) {\n    console.log(\"The parent contains the child.\");\n}\n```\n\n### `sizzle.uniq(results)`\n\nThis is an internal helper function used by Sizzle to remove duplicate elements from a result set. It's not typically called directly by developers.  The implementation details are internal to Sizzle's operation.\n\n\n### `sizzle.expr`\n\nThis object contains the core expression parsing engine of Sizzle. It defines the grammar and rules for interpreting CSS selectors.  It's an internal object and generally not directly used or modified by developers.\n\n\n### `sizzle.selectors`\n\nThis object contains the definitions of various CSS selectors understood by Sizzle. This is also an internal object used for the parsing process.  Direct manipulation is generally not recommended or necessary for standard usage.\n\n\n### `sizzle.relative`\n\nThis object holds the logic for handling relative selectors (combinators like `>`, `+`, `~`, and the descendant combinator space).  It's an internal component of Sizzle's selector engine, and direct interaction is usually unnecessary for common use cases.  The details are implementation-specific to the engine.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Optimizing SizzleJS Performance\n\nWhile SizzleJS is already highly optimized, several strategies can further enhance its performance, particularly when dealing with large or complex DOM structures:\n\n* **Reduce Selector Complexity:**  Avoid overly complex selectors.  Simple, specific selectors are generally faster than convoluted ones.  If possible, break down complex selections into smaller, more focused ones.\n\n* **Use IDs When Possible:**  ID selectors (`#id`) are the fastest because IDs must be unique within a document.  If you have IDs available, prioritize them over class or element selectors.\n\n* **Limit Context:**  When using the `context` argument in `Sizzle()`, restrict the context to the smallest possible portion of the DOM. Searching within a smaller subtree significantly improves speed.\n\n* **Caching Results:** If you repeatedly select the same elements, cache the results of the `Sizzle()` call to avoid redundant processing.  Store the results in a variable and reuse them.\n\n* **Minimize DOM Manipulation:**  Excessive DOM manipulation within a loop that uses Sizzle can degrade performance.  Try to batch DOM changes to minimize reflows and repaints.\n\n* **Avoid Unnecessary Selectors:**  If you're performing multiple selections from a subset of already-selected elements, consider using array methods (like `.filter()`) on the initial selection instead of repeatedly calling `Sizzle()`.\n\n* **Consider Native `querySelectorAll`:** For simple selectors and modern browsers, the native `querySelectorAll()` method can sometimes be faster than Sizzle.  Benchmark your specific use case to determine if this is a worthwhile optimization.\n\n\n### Extending SizzleJS with Custom Selectors\n\nSizzleJS allows extending its selector engine by adding custom pseudo-selectors or other custom functionality.  This is typically done by modifying the `sizzle.selectors` object, although the exact method may change across versions.  The specifics are typically implementation dependent and could require careful examination of the SizzleJS source code.  The best approach is always to check the latest documentation or examples if available from the project's official resources.\n\n\n### Using SizzleJS with Other Libraries\n\nSizzleJS is designed to be a standalone library.  It can be easily integrated with other JavaScript frameworks or libraries.  Simply include the SizzleJS script in your HTML file before including other scripts that depend on it.  Ensure that there are no naming conflicts with other libraries.  You can then use the `Sizzle()` function directly.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n* **No Results:** Double-check your selector for typos and ensure that the elements you're targeting actually exist in the DOM at the time the selector is executed. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the DOM structure and verify your selectors.\n\n* **Unexpected Results:** Verify the context you're using with `Sizzle()`. Incorrect context will lead to unexpected matches.  Ensure that your selectors are correctly reflecting the desired elements and their relationships (parent-child, siblings, etc.).\n\n* **Performance Problems:** See the \"Optimizing SizzleJS Performance\" section above.\n\n* **Browser Compatibility:** While Sizzle strives for broad compatibility, very old or unusual browsers might have edge cases. Test across different browsers and versions to ensure compatibility.\n\n* **Selector Errors:**  Invalid CSS selectors will generally either not find any elements or trigger JavaScript errors.  Carefully review the CSS selector specification for correct syntax.\n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Selector Examples\n\nThese examples demonstrate simple selector usage:\n\n```javascript\n// Select all paragraph elements\nvar paragraphs = Sizzle('p');\n\n// Select all elements with the class \"highlight\"\nvar highlightedElements = Sizzle('.highlight');\n\n// Select the element with the ID \"myElement\"\nvar myElement = Sizzle('#myElement')[0]; // [0] accesses the first (and only) element\n\n// Select all divs that are direct children of the body\nvar directDivs = Sizzle('body > div');\n\n//Select all list items within an unordered list.\nvar listItems = Sizzle('ul > li');\n```\n\n\n### Complex Selector Examples\n\nThese examples showcase more sophisticated selector combinations:\n\n```javascript\n// Select all <p> elements that are descendants of a <div> with the class \"container\"\nvar paragraphsInContainer = Sizzle('div.container p');\n\n// Select the first <li> element that is a child of an <ul> element with the class \"menu\"\nvar firstMenuItem = Sizzle('ul.menu > li:first-child')[0];\n\n// Select all inputs of type checkbox that are checked\nvar checkedCheckboxes = Sizzle('input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked');\n\n//Select all elements with the attribute data-test and that contains the value \"example\".\nvar dataTestElements = Sizzle('[data-test*=\"example\"]');\n\n//Select all list items that have the class \"active\" and are also descendants of a ul with the id \"myList\".\nvar activeListItems = Sizzle('#myList ul li.active');\n\n\n```\n\n### Practical Use Cases\n\nSizzleJS is versatile and applicable in various scenarios:\n\n* **DOM Manipulation:**  Select elements for modification, addition, removal, or styling.\n\n* **Form Handling:**  Identify and interact with specific form elements (e.g., checkboxes, radio buttons, text inputs).\n\n* **Dynamic Content Updates:**  Select elements to update after AJAX requests or other asynchronous operations.\n\n* **Creating Custom Widgets or Plugins:**  Use SizzleJS to select and manipulate elements within custom components.\n\n* **Testing Frameworks:**  Select specific elements for testing purposes.\n\n* **Data Extraction:** Select elements and extract their data for processing or display.\n\n\n### Code Examples with Explanations\n\nLet's illustrate practical usage:\n\n**Example 1: Hiding elements on click:**\n\n```javascript\n// Add an event listener to a button\ndocument.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {\n  // Select all elements with the class \"hideable\" using Sizzle\n  var elementsToHide = Sizzle('.hideable');\n\n  // Iterate over the selected elements and set their display style to \"none\"\n  for (var i = 0; i < elementsToHide.length; i++) {\n    elementsToHide[i].style.display = 'none';\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Example 2:  Adding a class to matched elements:**\n\n```javascript\n// Select all images within a specific div using Sizzle and add a class.\nvar images = Sizzle('#imageContainer img');\nfor (let i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {\n  images[i].classList.add('bordered');\n}\n```\n\n**Example 3:  Filtering Elements**\n\n```javascript\n// Select all list items, then filter them to keep only the ones with the class \"selected\".\nconst listItems = Sizzle('li');\nconst selectedItems = Array.from(listItems).filter(item => item.classList.contains('selected'));\nconsole.log(selectedItems);\n```\n\nThese examples show how SizzleJS's selector power simplifies DOM manipulation and enables efficient interaction with web page elements. Remember to replace placeholder IDs and classes with your actual element identifiers.\n\n\n## Contributing to SizzleJS\n\nThis section outlines the process for contributing to the SizzleJS project.
