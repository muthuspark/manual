Download:** Download the latest release from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/objectivehtml/FlipClock) and include the `flipclock.js` file in your project.  You'll also likely need the CSS file, `flipclock.css`.\n\n**2. CDN:** Use a CDN like jsDelivr:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flipclock@0.7.8/dist/flipclock.css\">\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flipclock@0.7.8/dist/flipclock.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `0.7.8` with the desired version number if needed.  Check the GitHub repository for the most up-to-date version.\n\n\n**3. npm:** If you're using npm, install FlipClock.js via:\n\n```bash\nnpm install flipclock\n```\n\nThen, include the necessary files in your project as you would with any other npm package.  You may need to adjust your build process to handle the inclusion of the CSS file appropriately.\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nAfter including the necessary CSS and JavaScript files, you can initialize a FlipClock instance with a simple JavaScript command:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"clock\"></div>\n<script>\n  var clock = new FlipClock($('.clock'), 10, {\n    clockFace: 'MinuteCounter' //Or 'Counter', 'HourlyCounter', 'DailyCounter'\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code creates a FlipClock instance that counts down from 10 seconds.  The first argument is a jQuery selector for the clock's container element. The second argument is the starting value (in seconds in this case). The third argument is an object containing optional settings. `clockFace` determines which clock face style to use.\n\nFor other clock faces (like hours, minutes, days, etc), adjust the starting value and the clockFace accordingly.  Refer to the documentation for a complete list of options and available clock faces.\n\n\n### Running the Example\n\nFlipClock.js includes example code to help you get started.  You can find this example code within the downloaded package or  at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/objectivehtml/FlipClock).\n\nTo run the example:\n\n1.  **Download:** Download the FlipClock.js package.\n2.  **Open `index.html`:**  Open the `index.html` file located within the example directory of the downloaded package in your web browser.  This HTML file includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript, and showcases the various options available within FlipClock.js\n\nThis will display a working FlipClock displaying the currently available examples. You can examine the source code in the `index.html` and the JavaScript files to better understand how to implement the various features. Remember to adjust file paths if you moved the files after downloading the package.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Clock Creation\n\nCreating a FlipClock instance involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Include necessary files:** Ensure that both the FlipClock CSS (`flipclock.css`) and JavaScript (`flipclock.js`) files are correctly included in your HTML document's `<head>` section.  This can be done via direct file inclusion, a CDN, or a package manager like npm, as described in the \"Getting Started\" section.\n\n2. **Create a container element:** In your HTML, create a `<div>` element (or other suitable container) that will hold the FlipClock.  This element should have a unique ID or class for easy selection with jQuery.  For instance: `<div id=\"clock\"></div>`.\n\n3. **Initialize FlipClock:** Use the FlipClock constructor to create a new clock instance.  The constructor takes at least two arguments:\n\n   * **Container:** A jQuery selector (e.g., `$('#clock')` or `$('.clock')`) pointing to the container element created in the previous step.\n   * **Time:** The initial time value for the clock.  The unit of this value depends on the chosen `clockFace`.  For `MinuteCounter`, it's seconds; for `HourlyCounter`, it's seconds;  For `DailyCounter` it is seconds and so on.  Note the time unit differs depending on what clock face you use.\n\n   Optional arguments can be passed as a third parameter to customize the clock's appearance and behavior (see below).\n\n   ```javascript\n   var clock = new FlipClock($('#clock'), 120, {\n       clockFace: 'MinuteCounter', // Specify the clock face\n       autoStart: false,            // Optional: start the clock automatically (default true)\n       // ... other options\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Start the clock (if necessary):** If `autoStart` is set to `false` in the options, you'll need to manually start the clock using the `start()` method:\n\n   ```javascript\n   clock.start();\n   ```\n\n\n### Time Formats\n\nFlipClock.js offers several pre-built clock faces (`clockFace`) that determine the time format displayed:\n\n* **`HourlyCounter`:** Displays hours, minutes, and seconds.\n* **`MinuteCounter`:** Displays minutes and seconds.\n* **`Counter`:** A simple counter that increments or decrements.\n* **`DailyCounter`:** Displays days, hours, minutes, and seconds.\n* **`TwelveHourClock`:** Displays time in 12-hour format (AM/PM).\n\n\nYou cannot directly customize the displayed time format beyond these pre-defined options without modifying the underlying code. If you need a different format, you might need to create a custom clock face.\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nFlipClock.js provides several events you can listen for to respond to changes in the clock's state.  These are typically handled using jQuery's `.on()` method with the clock instance as the context:\n\n* **`interval`:** This event is triggered every second (or other specified interval) and provides the current time value.  You can use this to update other parts of your application based on the clock's value.\n\n   ```javascript\n   clock.on('interval', function(time) {\n       console.log('Current time:', time.toString()); //time.getTime() also available\n       // Perform actions based on the current time\n   });\n   ```\n\n\n* **`start`:** Triggered when the clock starts.\n* **`stop`:** Triggered when the clock stops.\n* **`reset`:** Triggered when the clock is reset.\n\n   These events are used like this:\n\n   ```javascript\n   clock.on('start', function() {\n       console.log('Clock started');\n   });\n\n   clock.on('stop', function() {\n       console.log('Clock stopped');\n   });\n   \n   clock.on('reset', function() {\n       console.log('Clock reset');\n   });\n   ```\n\nRemember to replace `clock` with your actual FlipClock instance variable.  The specific data passed to the event handlers might vary depending on the event.  Consult the documentation for detailed information on each event and its associated data.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Appearance Customization\n\nFlipClock.js offers several ways to customize the appearance of your clock beyond the pre-defined clock faces. While it doesn't offer extensive direct styling options for individual components, you can achieve substantial customization through CSS.\n\n\nThe primary method for customizing the appearance is by overriding the default CSS provided in `flipclock.css`. You can create a separate stylesheet or modify `flipclock.css` directly.  Target specific classes within the generated HTML structure to style individual elements like digits, separators, and the overall clock container.  Inspect the HTML generated by FlipClock using your browser's developer tools to identify the classes you need to target.\n\nFor instance, to change the background color of the clock digits, you might find a class like `.flip-clock-active` or a more specific class related to a particular digit’s state (e.g., `.flip-clock-dot-top`).  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect and find the right class names to target.  Then, apply your CSS rules accordingly.  For example:\n\n```css\n.flip-clock-dot { /*Adjust class to target specific element*/\n  background-color: #FF0000; /*Example - change to your desired color*/\n}\n```\n\nRemember that the class names might slightly vary depending on the clock face used and the version of FlipClock.js.\n\n\n### Font and Color Settings\n\nFont and color settings can be customized using CSS as described above. To change the font, target the appropriate class within the generated HTML using CSS `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, etc.   To change the color of the digits or other elements, similarly use CSS properties like `color` and `background-color`, targeting the right class names.  Using your browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML structure will be vital in determining which classes to style.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\n.flip-clock-digit .flip-clock-wrapper {\n  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 3em;\n  color: #00FF00; /*Example - change to your desired color*/\n}\n```\n\nRemember that this is a general example.  The specific class names may vary depending on the FlipClock version and clock face used.  Inspect the rendered HTML using your browser’s developer tools to identify the correct classes.\n\n\n### Clock Sizes\n\nThe size of the FlipClock is primarily controlled by the CSS applied to the container and its inner elements.  You cannot directly set the size within the FlipClock constructor.  You must adjust the size using CSS.  This means adjusting properties like `width`, `height`, `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin` on the container element and its children.  You can set specific dimensions, or use percentages or other relative units to control the clock's size relative to its parent container.  Again, inspecting the HTML using your browser's developer tools will be essential to determine the appropriate classes to target for consistent sizing across different elements of the clock.\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\n.clock { /* Assuming your clock is in a div with class 'clock' */\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 100px;\n}\n.flip-clock-digit {\n  font-size: 50px;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the selector (`.clock` in this example) to match the actual class or ID of your FlipClock container element.  Experiment with different values and selectors to fine-tune the size and proportions as needed.\n\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Countdown Timers\n\nFlipClock.js is easily adapted to create countdown timers.  The core mechanism remains the same; you simply set the initial time value and use the `clock.getTime()` method to track the remaining time.  When the clock reaches zero, you can handle the event using the `stop` event or by periodically checking the value returned by `getTime()`.\n\nFor example, to create a countdown timer that starts at 60 seconds and stops at zero:\n\n\n```html\n<div class=\"clock\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  var clock = new FlipClock($('.clock'), 60, {\n    countdown: true, // Important: enable countdown mode\n    clockFace: 'MinuteCounter'\n  });\n\n  clock.on('stop', function() {\n    alert('Time\\'s up!');\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nThe `countdown: true` option is crucial here.  Without it, the clock will count upwards from 60.  The `stop` event is triggered when the counter reaches zero.  Alternatively, you could check the time within the `interval` event:\n\n```javascript\nclock.on('interval', function(time){\n    if(time.getTime() === 0){\n        alert(\"Time's up!\");\n    }\n})\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the initial time value and clockFace according to your needs.  You might also want to implement additional functionality to reset the timer or handle other user interactions.\n\n\n\n### Multiple Clocks\n\nYou can easily create multiple FlipClock instances on a single page. Each instance will be independent and will require its own container element and initialization call.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"clock1\"></div>\n<div id=\"clock2\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  var clock1 = new FlipClock($('#clock1'), 120, { clockFace: 'MinuteCounter' });\n  var clock2 = new FlipClock($('#clock2'), 3600, { clockFace: 'HourlyCounter' });\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code creates two clocks: `clock1` counts down from two minutes, and `clock2` counts down from one hour.  Ensure each clock has a unique container element (in this example, `#clock1` and `#clock2`).  Each clock will function independently. You can control and manage each clock instance separately using its respective methods and event handlers.\n\n\n### Integration with other libraries\n\nFlipClock.js utilizes jQuery for DOM manipulation. It's designed to work well within a larger jQuery-based application.  Integration with other JavaScript libraries generally depends on their compatibility with jQuery.\n\nIf you're using other libraries that don't directly conflict with jQuery, you should be able to incorporate FlipClock.js without problems.  However, be mindful of potential naming conflicts or library dependencies.  Check for compatibility notes in the documentation of the other libraries you plan to use.  If you are using a framework such as React, Angular or Vue.js, you will need to adapt the code according to the requirements of the framework.  For example, you would typically wrap your FlipClock initialization within a lifecycle method of a component.\n\nFor example, if you use a library for handling user interactions, you might trigger FlipClock's `start()` or `stop()` methods based on those interactions.  Properly manage the order of loading of the scripts and ensure that any dependencies are met. You may need to adjust your project's build process (if using a build tool like Webpack or Parcel) to ensure all necessary files are included and dependencies are handled correctly.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### FlipClock Constructor\n\nThe `FlipClock` constructor creates a new FlipClock instance.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nnew FlipClock(container, time, options);\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `container`:  (required) A jQuery object or selector representing the HTML element that will contain the clock.\n* `time`: (required)  The initial time value for the clock. The unit depends on the `clockFace` option (seconds for `MinuteCounter`, seconds for `HourlyCounter`, etc.).\n* `options`: (optional) An object containing various settings to customize the clock's behavior and appearance.  See the \"Options\" section below for details.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar clock = new FlipClock($('#clock'), 60, { clockFace: 'MinuteCounter' });\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\nFlipClock instances have several methods available to control their behavior:\n\n* **`getTime()`:** Returns a `FlipClockTime` object representing the current time of the clock.  The `getTime()` method will return an object containing methods like `getTime()`, `getSeconds()`, `getMinutes()`, `getHours()`, and `getDay()`, depending on which clockface you are using. The exact methods available depend on which clock face is used.\n* **`setTime(newTime)`:** Sets the clock's time to a new value.  `newTime` should be a number representing the time in the appropriate unit (seconds, etc., depending on the clockface).\n* **`start()`:** Starts the clock.\n* **`stop()`:** Stops the clock.\n* **`reset()`:** Resets the clock to its initial time.\n* **`increment()`:** Increments the clock's time by one unit.\n* **`decrement()`:** Decrements the clock's time by one unit.\n* **`on(eventName, callback)`:** Attaches an event handler to the clock. See the \"Events\" section for details on available events.\n* **`off(eventName, callback)`:** Removes an event handler from the clock.\n\n\n### Events\n\nFlipClock instances trigger several events that you can listen for:\n\n* **`interval`:** Triggered every second (or at the specified interval).  The event handler receives a `FlipClockTime` object as its argument.\n* **`start`:** Triggered when the clock starts.\n* **`stop`:** Triggered when the clock stops.\n* **`reset`:** Triggered when the clock is reset.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nclock.on('interval', function(time) {\n  console.log(\"Current time:\", time.getTime());\n});\n\nclock.on('stop', function() {\n  alert('Clock stopped!');\n});\n```\n\nRemember to replace `clock` with your actual FlipClock instance.\n\n\n### Properties\n\nFlipClock instances have several properties, though most of the direct manipulation of these should be done using the methods above. Directly accessing these properties is generally not recommended.  Modifying them directly can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n\n* **`clockFace`:**  (Read-only) A reference to the clock face instance being used.\n* **`countdown`:** (Read-only) A boolean indicating whether the clock is in countdown mode.  This reflects the setting from when the clock was initially created.\n* **`running`:** (Read-only) A boolean that indicates whether the clock is currently running.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the FlipClock.js API is relatively straightforward and mostly involves using the methods provided to control the clock's behavior and listen for events rather than directly manipulating properties.  The documentation may not comprehensively list every single internal property; modifying them directly may have unintended consequences and is not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Clock not appearing:**  Ensure that both the FlipClock CSS (`flipclock.css`) and JavaScript (`flipclock.js`) files are correctly included in your HTML document and that the file paths are correct.  Double-check that the jQuery library is also included if you're using jQuery selectors.  Inspect your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the clock from initializing. Verify that the container element you specified exists in the DOM before the FlipClock initialization script runs.\n\n* **Incorrect time display:** Confirm that you are providing the correct initial time value to the `FlipClock` constructor and that the time unit matches the selected `clockFace`.  Check that your `clockFace` option is set correctly (e.g., 'MinuteCounter', 'HourlyCounter'). Ensure that any calculations used to determine the initial time are accurate.\n\n* **Clock not starting/stopping:** Verify that the `start()` and `stop()` methods are being called correctly.  Make sure the `autoStart` option is set appropriately in the constructor if you want the clock to start immediately. Check the developer console for JavaScript errors and consider using the `console.log` to check the state of your clock at different points.\n\n* **Events not firing:** Check that the event names (`interval`, `start`, `stop`, `reset`) you're using are correct and that your event handlers are correctly attached using the `on()` method. Make sure the event handler function is correctly defined and that there are no syntax errors.  Use `console.log` statements within your event handlers to confirm if they're being triggered.\n\n* **Styling issues:** If the clock's appearance isn't as expected, use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the rendered HTML and CSS.  This allows you to see what styles are applied to the clock elements. Ensure there are no conflicting CSS rules.  Carefully examine the HTML structure generated by FlipClock; ensure you target the right class names in your CSS. Consider adding very specific CSS rules to override any potentially conflicting styles.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:** The browser's developer tools (typically accessed by pressing F12) are invaluable for debugging JavaScript issues. The console will display JavaScript errors, and the network tab can help to identify if the necessary CSS and JavaScript files are being loaded. The elements tab is important for inspecting the HTML generated by FlipClock and the CSS applied.\n\n* **Console logging:** Strategically place `console.log()` statements in your code to check the values of variables, the flow of execution, and the timing of events.  This can significantly help in pinpointing where problems occur.  For example, log the value of `time` in your `interval` event handler.\n\n* **Simplify:** If you're having trouble with a complex implementation, try simplifying your code to isolate the problem. Create a minimal example that reproduces the error. This helps to focus your debugging efforts.\n\n* **Check jQuery:** If you're using jQuery selectors, ensure jQuery is correctly included and that your selectors are valid and target the correct elements. Inspect the generated HTML and ensure the selectors are targeting what you expect.\n\n* **Version Compatibility:** Ensure you are using compatible versions of jQuery and FlipClock.js.  Check the FlipClock documentation for compatibility details.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nFlipClock.js itself doesn't have extensive built-in error handling mechanisms beyond the standard JavaScript error handling. If an error occurs during initialization or operation (such as an invalid selector), you'll typically see a JavaScript error message in your browser's developer console.\n\nFor more robust error handling within your application, you should wrap your FlipClock initialization and related code in `try...catch` blocks.  This allows you to handle potential errors gracefully without crashing the entire application. For instance:\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  var clock = new FlipClock($('#clock'), 60, { clockFace: 'MinuteCounter' });\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(\"Error creating FlipClock:\", error);\n  // Implement alternative behavior or display an error message to the user\n}\n```\n\nYou can add more specific error handling based on the types of errors you anticipate (e.g., checking for the existence of the container element before creating the FlipClock). Remember that error handling should be tailored to the specific needs of your application and the contexts in which errors might occur.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to FlipClock.js!

You can examine the source code in the `index.html` and the JavaScript files to better understand how to implement the various features. Remember to adjust file paths if you moved the files after downloading the package.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Clock Creation\n\nCreating a FlipClock instance involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Include necessary files:** Ensure that both the FlipClock CSS (`flipclock.css`) and JavaScript (`flipclock.js`) files are correctly included in your HTML document's `<head>` section.  This can be done via direct file inclusion, a CDN, or a package manager like npm, as described in the \"Getting Started\" section.\n\n2. **Create a container element:** In your HTML, create a `<div>` element (or other suitable container) that will hold the FlipClock.  This element should have a unique ID or class for easy selection with jQuery.  For instance: `<div id=\"clock\"></div>`.\n\n3. **Initialize FlipClock:** Use the FlipClock constructor to create a new clock instance.  The constructor takes at least two arguments:\n\n   * **Container:** A jQuery selector (e.g., `$('#clock')` or `$('.clock')`) pointing to the container element created in the previous step.\n   * **Time:** The initial time value for the clock.

Note the time unit differs depending on what clock face you use.\n\n   Optional arguments can be passed as a third parameter to customize the clock's appearance and behavior (see below).\n\n   ```javascript\n   var clock = new FlipClock($('#clock'), 120, {\n       clockFace: 'MinuteCounter', // Specify the clock face\n       autoStart: false,            // Optional: start the clock automatically (default true)\n       // ... other options\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Start the clock (if necessary):** If `autoStart` is set to `false` in the options, you'll need to manually start the clock using the `start()` method:\n\n   ```javascript\n   clock.start();\n   ```\n\n\n### Time Formats\n\nFlipClock.js offers several pre-built clock faces (`clockFace`) that determine the time format displayed:\n\n* **`HourlyCounter`:** Displays hours, minutes, and seconds.\n* **`MinuteCounter`:** Displays minutes and seconds.\n* **`Counter`:** A simple counter that increments or decrements.\n* **`DailyCounter`:** Displays days, hours, minutes, and seconds.\n* **`TwelveHourClock`:** Displays time in 12-hour format (AM/PM).\n\n\nYou cannot directly customize the displayed time format beyond these pre-defined options without modifying the underlying code. If you need a different format, you might need to create a custom clock face.\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nFlipClock.js provides several events you can listen for to respond to changes in the clock's state.  These are typically handled using jQuery's `.on()` method with the clock instance as the context:\n\n* **`interval`:** This event is triggered every second (or other specified interval) and provides the current time value.  You can use this to update other parts of your application based on the clock's value.\n\n   ```javascript\n   clock.on('interval', function(time) {\n       console.log('Current time:', time.toString()); //time.getTime() also available\n       // Perform actions based on the current time\n   });\n   ```\n\n\n* **`start`:** Triggered when the clock starts.\n* **`stop`:** Triggered when the clock stops.\n* **`reset`:** Triggered when the clock is reset.\n\n   These events are used like this:\n\n   ```javascript\n   clock.on('start', function() {\n       console.log('Clock started');\n   });\n\n   clock.on('stop', function() {\n       console.log('Clock stopped');\n   });\n   \n   clock.on('reset', function() {\n       console.log('Clock reset');\n   });\n   ```\n\nRemember to replace `clock` with your actual FlipClock instance variable.  The specific data passed to the event handlers might vary depending on the event.  Consult the documentation for detailed information on each event and its associated data.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Appearance Customization\n\nFlipClock.js offers several ways to customize the appearance of your clock beyond the pre-defined clock faces. While it doesn't offer extensive direct styling options for individual components, you can achieve substantial customization through CSS.\n\n\nThe primary method for customizing the appearance is by overriding the default CSS provided in `flipclock.css`. You can create a separate stylesheet or modify `flipclock.css` directly.  Target specific classes within the generated HTML structure to style individual elements like digits, separators, and the overall clock container.  Inspect the HTML generated by FlipClock using your browser's developer tools to identify the classes you need to target.\n\nFor instance, to change the background color of the clock digits, you might find a class like `.flip-clock-active` or a more specific class related to a particular digit’s state (e.g., `.flip-clock-dot-top`).  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect and find the right class names to target.  Then, apply your CSS rules accordingly.  For example:\n\n```css\n.flip-clock-dot { /*Adjust class to target specific element*/\n  background-color: #FF0000; /*Example - change to your desired color*/\n}\n```\n\nRemember that the class names might slightly vary depending on the clock face used and the version of FlipClock.js.\n\n\n### Font and Color Settings\n\nFont and color settings can be customized using CSS as described above. To change the font, target the appropriate class within the generated HTML using CSS `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, etc.   To change the color of the digits or other elements, similarly use CSS properties like `color` and `background-color`, targeting the right class names.  Using your browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML structure will be vital in determining which classes to style.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\n.flip-clock-digit .flip-clock-wrapper {\n  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n  font-size: 3em;\n  color: #00FF00; /*Example - change to your desired color*/\n}\n```\n\nRemember that this is a general example.  The specific class names may vary depending on the FlipClock version and clock face used.  Inspect the rendered HTML using your browser’s developer tools to identify the correct classes.\n\n\n### Clock Sizes\n\nThe size of the FlipClock is primarily controlled by the CSS applied to the container and its inner elements.  You cannot directly set the size within the FlipClock constructor.  You must adjust the size using CSS.  This means adjusting properties like `width`, `height`, `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin` on the container element and its children.  You can set specific dimensions, or use percentages or other relative units to control the clock's size relative to its parent container.  Again, inspecting the HTML using your browser's developer tools will be essential to determine the appropriate classes to target for consistent sizing across different elements of the clock.\n\nFor example:\n\n```css\n.clock { /* Assuming your clock is in a div with class 'clock' */\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 100px;\n}\n.flip-clock-digit {\n  font-size: 50px;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the selector (`.clock` in this example) to match the actual class or ID of your FlipClock container element.  Experiment with different values and selectors to fine-tune the size and proportions as needed.\n\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Countdown Timers\n\nFlipClock.js is easily adapted to create countdown timers.  The core mechanism remains the same; you simply set the initial time value and use the `clock.getTime()` method to track the remaining time.  When the clock reaches zero, you can handle the event using the `stop` event or by periodically checking the value returned by `getTime()`.\n\nFor example, to create a countdown timer that starts at 60 seconds and stops at zero:\n\n\n```html\n<div class=\"clock\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  var clock = new FlipClock($('.clock'), 60, {\n    countdown: true, // Important: enable countdown mode\n    clockFace: 'MinuteCounter'\n  });\n\n  clock.on('stop', function() {\n    alert('Time\\'s up!');\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nThe `countdown: true` option is crucial here.  Without it, the clock will count upwards from 60.  The `stop` event is triggered when the counter reaches zero.  Alternatively, you could check the time within the `interval` event:\n\n```javascript\nclock.on('interval', function(time){\n    if(time.getTime() === 0){\n        alert(\"Time's up!\");\n    }\n})\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the initial time value and clockFace according to your needs.  You might also want to implement additional functionality to reset the timer or handle other user interactions.\n\n\n\n### Multiple Clocks\n\nYou can easily create multiple FlipClock instances on a single page. Each instance will be independent and will require its own container element and initialization call.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"clock1\"></div>\n<div id=\"clock2\"></div>\n\n<script>\n  var clock1 = new FlipClock($('#clock1'), 120, { clockFace: 'MinuteCounter' });\n  var clock2 = new FlipClock($('#clock2'), 3600, { clockFace: 'HourlyCounter' });\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code creates two clocks: `clock1` counts down from two minutes, and `clock2` counts down from one hour.  Ensure each clock has a unique container element (in this example, `#clock1` and `#clock2`).  Each clock will function independently. You can control and manage each clock instance separately using its respective methods and event handlers.\n\n\n### Integration with other libraries\n\nFlipClock.js utilizes jQuery for DOM manipulation. It's designed to work well within a larger jQuery-based application.  Integration with other JavaScript libraries generally depends on their compatibility with jQuery.\n\nIf you're using other libraries that don't directly conflict with jQuery, you should be able to incorporate FlipClock.js without problems.  However, be mindful of potential naming conflicts or library dependencies.  Check for compatibility notes in the documentation of the other libraries you plan to use.  If you are using a framework such as React, Angular or Vue.js, you will need to adapt the code according to the requirements of the framework.  For example, you would typically wrap your FlipClock initialization within a lifecycle method of a component.\n\nFor example, if you use a library for handling user interactions, you might trigger FlipClock's `start()` or `stop()` methods based on those interactions.  Properly manage the order of loading of the scripts and ensure that any dependencies are met. You may need to adjust your project's build process (if using a build tool like Webpack or Parcel) to ensure all necessary files are included and dependencies are handled correctly.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### FlipClock Constructor\n\nThe `FlipClock` constructor creates a new FlipClock instance.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nnew FlipClock(container, time, options);\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `container`:  (required) A jQuery object or selector representing the HTML element that will contain the clock.\n* `time`: (required)  The initial time value for the clock. The unit depends on the `clockFace` option (seconds for `MinuteCounter`, seconds for `HourlyCounter`, etc.).\n* `options`: (optional) An object containing various settings to customize the clock's behavior and appearance.  See the \"Options\" section below for details.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nvar clock = new FlipClock($('#clock'), 60, { clockFace: 'MinuteCounter' });\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\nFlipClock instances have several methods available to control their behavior:\n\n* **`getTime()`:** Returns a `FlipClockTime` object representing the current time of the clock.  The `getTime()` method will return an object containing methods like `getTime()`, `getSeconds()`, `getMinutes()`, `getHours()`, and `getDay()`, depending on which clockface you are using. The exact methods available depend on which clock face is used.\n* **`setTime(newTime)`:** Sets the clock's time to a new value.  `newTime` should be a number representing the time in the appropriate unit (seconds, etc., depending on the clockface).\n* **`start()`:** Starts the clock.\n* **`stop()`:** Stops the clock.\n* **`reset()`:** Resets the clock to its initial time.\n* **`increment()`:** Increments the clock's time by one unit.\n* **`decrement()`:** Decrements the clock's time by one unit.\n* **`on(eventName, callback)`:** Attaches an event handler to the clock. See the \"Events\" section for details on available events.\n* **`off(eventName, callback)`:** Removes an event handler from the clock.\n\n\n### Events\n\nFlipClock instances trigger several events that you can listen for:\n\n* **`interval`:** Triggered every second (or at the specified interval).  The event handler receives a `FlipClockTime` object as its argument.\n* **`start`:** Triggered when the clock starts.\n* **`stop`:** Triggered when the clock stops.\n* **`reset`:** Triggered when the clock is reset.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nclock.on('interval', function(time) {\n  console.log(\"Current time:\", time.getTime());\n});\n\nclock.on('stop', function() {\n  alert('Clock stopped!');\n});\n```\n\nRemember to replace `clock` with your actual FlipClock instance.\n\n\n### Properties\n\nFlipClock instances have several properties, though most of the direct manipulation of these should be done using the methods above. Directly accessing these properties is generally not recommended.  Modifying them directly can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n\n* **`clockFace`:**  (Read-only) A reference to the clock face instance being used.\n* **`countdown`:** (Read-only) A boolean indicating whether the clock is in countdown mode.  This reflects the setting from when the clock was initially created.\n* **`running`:** (Read-only) A boolean that indicates whether the clock is currently running.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the FlipClock.js API is relatively straightforward and mostly involves using the methods provided to control the clock's behavior and listen for events rather than directly manipulating properties.  The documentation may not comprehensively list every single internal property; modifying them directly may have unintended consequences and is not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Clock not appearing:**  Ensure that both the FlipClock CSS (`flipclock.css`) and JavaScript (`flipclock.js`) files are correctly included in your HTML document and that the file paths are correct.  Double-check that the jQuery library is also included if you're using jQuery selectors.  Inspect your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the clock from initializing. Verify that the container element you specified exists in the DOM before the FlipClock initialization script runs.\n\n* **Incorrect time display:** Confirm that you are providing the correct initial time value to the `FlipClock` constructor and that the time unit matches the selected `clockFace`.  Check that your `clockFace` option is set correctly (e.g., 'MinuteCounter', 'HourlyCounter'). Ensure that any calculations used to determine the initial time are accurate.\n\n* **Clock not starting/stopping:** Verify that the `start()` and `stop()` methods are being called correctly.  Make sure the `autoStart` option is set appropriately in the constructor if you want the clock to start immediately. Check the developer console for JavaScript errors and consider using the `console.log` to check the state of your clock at different points.\n\n* **Events not firing:** Check that the event names (`interval`, `start`, `stop`, `reset`) you're using are correct and that your event handlers are correctly attached using the `on()` method. Make sure the event handler function is correctly defined and that there are no syntax errors.  Use `console.log` statements within your event handlers to confirm if they're being triggered.\n\n* **Styling issues:** If the clock's appearance isn't as expected, use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the rendered HTML and CSS.  This allows you to see what styles are applied to the clock elements. Ensure there are no conflicting CSS rules.  Carefully examine the HTML structure generated by FlipClock; ensure you target the right class names in your CSS. Consider adding very specific CSS rules to override any potentially conflicting styles.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:** The browser's developer tools (typically accessed by pressing F12) are invaluable for debugging JavaScript issues. The console will display JavaScript errors, and the network tab can help to identify if the necessary CSS and JavaScript files are being loaded. The elements tab is important for inspecting the HTML generated by FlipClock and the CSS applied.\n\n* **Console logging:** Strategically place `console.log()` statements in your code to check the values of variables, the flow of execution, and the timing of events.  This can significantly help in pinpointing where problems occur.  For example, log the value of `time` in your `interval` event handler.\n\n* **Simplify:** If you're having trouble with a complex implementation, try simplifying your code to isolate the problem. Create a minimal example that reproduces the error. This helps to focus your debugging efforts.\n\n* **Check jQuery:** If you're using jQuery selectors, ensure jQuery is correctly included and that your selectors are valid and target the correct elements. Inspect the generated HTML and ensure the selectors are targeting what you expect.\n\n* **Version Compatibility:** Ensure you are using compatible versions of jQuery and FlipClock.js.  Check the FlipClock documentation for compatibility details.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nFlipClock.js itself doesn't have extensive built-in error handling mechanisms beyond the standard JavaScript error handling. If an error occurs during initialization or operation (such as an invalid selector), you'll typically see a JavaScript error message in your browser's developer console.\n\nFor more robust error handling within your application, you should wrap your FlipClock initialization and related code in `try...catch` blocks.  This allows you to handle potential errors gracefully without crashing the entire application. For instance:\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  var clock = new FlipClock($('#clock'), 60, { clockFace: 'MinuteCounter' });\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(\"Error creating FlipClock:\", error);\n  // Implement alternative behavior or display an error message to the user\n}\n```\n\nYou can add more specific error handling based on the types of errors you anticipate (e.g., checking for the existence of the container element before creating the FlipClock). Remember that error handling should be tailored to the specific needs of your application and the contexts in which errors might occur.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to FlipClock.js!
