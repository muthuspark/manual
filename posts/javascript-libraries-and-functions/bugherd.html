<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 id="creating-a-bugherd-account">Creating a BugHerd Account</h3>
<p>To begin using BugHerd, you first need to create an account. Visit the BugHerd website (<a href="replace with actual URL if different">https://www.bugherd.com/</a>) and click the “Sign Up” or equivalent button. You’ll be prompted to provide some basic information, such as your email address and a password. Choose a strong password for security. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the registration process. Once your account is created, you’ll be able to log in and start adding projects.</p>
<h3 id="installing-the-bugherd-browser-extension">Installing the BugHerd Browser Extension</h3>
<p>The BugHerd browser extension is essential for reporting bugs directly from your website. Download and install the extension for your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) from the BugHerd website or your browser’s extension store. Search for “BugHerd” and select the official extension. After installation, the BugHerd icon will appear in your browser’s toolbar. Click it to verify the installation and ensure it’s correctly connected to your account.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-project">Adding a Project</h3>
<p>After creating your account, you’ll need to add a project to begin tracking bugs for a specific website. Navigate to your BugHerd dashboard. You’ll find a button or link to “Add Project” or a similarly labeled option. You’ll be asked to provide a name for your project and, crucially, the website URL you want to monitor. This is the website where the BugHerd browser extension will allow you to submit bug reports. Once you’ve entered the project name and website URL, click “Create Project” or the equivalent button to add the project to your dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-bugherd-dashboard">Understanding the BugHerd Dashboard</h3>
<p>Your BugHerd dashboard serves as your central hub for managing all your projects and bug reports. Upon logging in, you’ll see a list of your projects. Clicking on a project will take you to its specific view, where you can see all the reported bugs. Each bug report typically includes details such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screenshot:</strong> A visual representation of the bug.</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A text description provided by the reporter.</li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> The current stage of the bug (e.g., New, In Progress, Resolved).</li>
<li><strong>Priority:</strong> The severity level of the bug.</li>
<li><strong>Assignee:</strong> The team member responsible for fixing the bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dashboard provides tools for filtering and sorting bugs, assigning them to team members, updating their status, and managing overall project progress. Familiarize yourself with the dashboard’s features to effectively manage your bug tracking workflow.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-bugs">Submitting Bugs</h2>
<h3 id="taking-screenshots-and-screen-recordings">Taking Screenshots and Screen Recordings</h3>
<p>When submitting a bug, a clear visual representation is crucial. The BugHerd browser extension allows you to easily capture screenshots of the issue. Simply select the area you wish to capture or take a full-page screenshot. BugHerd also often provides the option to capture a short screen recording to better illustrate dynamic issues or reproduce steps to trigger the problem. Ensure the screenshot or screen recording clearly shows the problem area and any relevant context on the webpage.</p>
<h3 id="adding-annotations-and-descriptions">Adding Annotations and Descriptions</h3>
<p>After capturing a screenshot or screen recording, use BugHerd’s annotation tools to highlight the specific problem area. You can draw arrows, circles, rectangles, and add text directly onto the image. This helps focus attention on the exact bug location. In the description field, provide detailed information about the bug:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steps to Reproduce:</strong> Clearly outline the steps needed to reproduce the bug.</li>
<li><strong>Expected Behavior:</strong> Describe how the feature should work.</li>
<li><strong>Actual Behavior:</strong> Describe what is actually happening.</li>
<li><strong>Browser and OS:</strong> Specify the browser and operating system used.</li>
<li><strong>Any Relevant Information:</strong> Include any other details that might be helpful in understanding the bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-written description significantly aids developers in understanding and resolving the bug.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-bugs-to-team-members">Assigning Bugs to Team Members</h3>
<p>Once a bug is submitted, you can assign it to a specific team member responsible for fixing it. BugHerd typically provides a field or dropdown menu to select the assignee from a list of team members added to your project. Assigning bugs helps to distribute the workload and ensures accountability.</p>
<h3 id="setting-priorities-and-due-dates">Setting Priorities and Due Dates</h3>
<p>Prioritize bugs based on their severity and impact. BugHerd likely allows you to set priority levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low). This helps the development team focus on the most urgent issues first. You may also have the option to set due dates for bugs, establishing timelines for resolution.</p>
<h3 id="using-custom-fields">Using Custom Fields</h3>
<p>To enhance bug reporting and tracking, BugHerd might offer the capability to add custom fields. These custom fields allow you to add project-specific information to bug reports, such as client name, software version, or specific feature. Leveraging custom fields allows for better organization and filtering of bug reports based on specific criteria relevant to your project.</p>
<h3 id="bulk-actions-on-bugs">Bulk Actions on Bugs</h3>
<p>For efficient management, BugHerd should provide tools for performing bulk actions on multiple bugs simultaneously. This could include actions such as changing the status of multiple bugs, assigning them to a specific team member, or updating their priority levels. Look for options like “Select All” or similar functions to apply bulk actions efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="searching-and-filtering-bugs">Searching and Filtering Bugs</h3>
<p>BugHerd’s search and filtering capabilities allow you to quickly locate specific bugs within a project. You can typically search by keywords in the description, title, or custom fields. Filtering options often include status, priority, assignee, due date, and custom field values, enabling you to refine your search and focus on particular sets of bugs.</p>
<h2 id="managing-projects">Managing Projects</h2>
<h3 id="adding-and-managing-team-members">Adding and Managing Team Members</h3>
<p>Effective project management relies on teamwork. Within BugHerd, you’ll likely find options to add and manage team members associated with each project. This usually involves adding their email addresses and assigning roles that determine their access level and permissions within the project. You should also be able to remove team members as needed. Managing team members ensures that only authorized individuals have access to project-related information and bug reports.</p>
<h3 id="setting-project-permissions">Setting Project Permissions</h3>
<p>Control access to your project by setting appropriate permissions for each team member. Different roles (e.g., Administrator, Developer, Tester, Client) might be defined, each with varying levels of access. Administrators typically have full control, while other roles might have restricted access, such as viewing bugs, submitting bugs, or updating bug statuses. Properly configuring permissions safeguards sensitive project data and maintains a structured workflow.</p>
<h3 id="creating-custom-workflows">Creating Custom Workflows</h3>
<p>Tailor BugHerd to your team’s specific workflow by configuring custom workflows. This might involve defining custom statuses (e.g., “Triaged,” “Testing,” “QA Approved”), adding custom fields for specific project details, or integrating with other tools to automate tasks. Customizing your workflow streamlines your bug-tracking process and ensures better alignment with your team’s practices.</p>
<h3 id="managing-integrations">Managing Integrations</h3>
<p>Expand BugHerd’s functionality by integrating it with other tools and services your team utilizes. BugHerd might support integrations with project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana), communication platforms (e.g., Slack), or other development tools. Managing these integrations involves configuring connections and defining how data is exchanged between BugHerd and the integrated platforms, optimizing your workflow and data management.</p>
<h3 id="project-settings-and-configuration">Project Settings and Configuration</h3>
<p>Access and manage various project settings to tailor BugHerd to your specific needs. This could include modifying project details (name, description), customizing notification settings, configuring email preferences, and setting up reporting options. Regularly reviewing and adjusting these settings maintains optimal project configuration and ensures the system works effectively for your team.</p>
<h3 id="archiving-and-deleting-projects">Archiving and Deleting Projects</h3>
<p>When a project is completed or no longer needed, you can archive or delete it. Archiving usually preserves project data but removes it from active lists, allowing you to retrieve it later if needed. Deleting permanently removes the project and all its associated data. Before deleting, ensure you’ve backed up any important information if necessary. Choose the option that best fits your long-term data retention strategy.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-communication">Collaboration &amp; Communication</h2>
<h3 id="using-the-commenting-system">Using the Commenting System</h3>
<p>Effective communication is crucial for resolving bugs efficiently. BugHerd’s commenting system allows team members to directly communicate on individual bug reports. Use the comment section to ask clarifying questions, provide updates on progress, share relevant information, or discuss potential solutions. Clear and concise comments ensure everyone stays informed and contributes effectively to the bug resolution process.</p>
<h3 id="notifications-and-alerts">Notifications and Alerts</h3>
<p>Stay updated on project activities and bug status changes through BugHerd’s notification and alert system. Configure your notification preferences to receive updates via email or other channels when new bugs are submitted, statuses are changed, comments are added, or other significant events occur. Tailoring your notification settings ensures you receive relevant information without being overwhelmed by unnecessary updates.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-activity-feed">Using the Activity Feed</h3>
<p>Monitor overall project activity using the activity feed. This feed often provides a chronological log of all events related to a project, including bug submissions, status changes, comments, and other significant actions. Reviewing the activity feed provides a comprehensive overview of project progress and highlights areas needing attention or further collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="internal-communication-features">Internal Communication Features</h3>
<p>BugHerd may include features to facilitate internal communication beyond the individual bug report comments. This could involve internal messaging capabilities within the platform, enabling quick communication among team members regarding a specific bug or project-wide updates. These features streamline communication, reducing the need to switch between different applications, and keeping all relevant conversations centralized within the BugHerd environment.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-analytics">Reporting &amp; Analytics</h2>
<h3 id="generating-reports">Generating Reports</h3>
<p>BugHerd likely provides tools to generate reports summarizing project performance and bug activity. These reports typically offer different views of your data, such as summaries by status, priority, assignee, or time period. You can select the specific criteria and metrics you need to gain insights into your project’s health and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<h3 id="analyzing-bug-trends">Analyzing Bug Trends</h3>
<p>By analyzing the data in your generated reports, you can identify trends and patterns in bug reporting. For example, you might discover that certain browser versions or operating systems experience more bugs than others, or that particular features consistently cause more issues. Understanding these trends is essential for prioritizing development efforts and proactively addressing potential problems.</p>
<h3 id="customizing-report-views">Customizing Report Views</h3>
<p>To get the most relevant information, customize your report views to focus on the metrics that matter most to you. You might be able to modify the time range, choose specific assignees or statuses to filter the data, and select which metrics are displayed. Tailoring report views ensures you efficiently obtain the insights you need.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-data">Exporting Data</h3>
<p>Export your BugHerd data to external tools for further analysis or integration with other systems. The export function typically supports common formats like CSV or Excel, enabling you to use the data in spreadsheet software or other data analysis programs. Exporting data gives you the flexibility to use your BugHerd information in ways that best fit your existing workflows and analytical tools.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-key-metrics">Understanding Key Metrics</h3>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the key metrics BugHerd provides to interpret your project’s health and performance. This could include metrics such as:</p>
<ul>

The BugHerd interface will guide you through the necessary steps, which might include providing the appropriate access tokens or configuring webhooks. Carefully follow the instructions provided to ensure successful integration.</p>
<h3 id="using-integrated-platforms">Using Integrated Platforms</h3>
<p>Once an integration is set up, you can utilize the combined capabilities of BugHerd and the integrated platform. For example, you might automatically create Jira tickets from BugHerd reports, post bug updates to a Slack channel, or link BugHerd bugs to specific code commits in your repository. Refer to the BugHerd documentation for specific instructions on how to use the capabilities of each integrated platform effectively.</p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting-integration-issues">Troubleshooting Integration Issues</h3>
<p>If you encounter problems with your integrations, consult the BugHerd documentation or support resources. Common issues might include incorrect API keys, authentication failures, or network connectivity problems. When troubleshooting, check the integration settings in both BugHerd and the integrated platform to ensure the configurations are correct and the connection is properly established. If problems persist, contact BugHerd support for assistance.</p>
<h2 id="api-reference">API Reference</h2>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p>Accessing the BugHerd API typically requires authentication. This usually involves using an API key or token obtained from your BugHerd account settings. The specific authentication method (e.g., API key in header, OAuth 2.0) will be documented in the detailed API specification. Ensure you securely store and handle your API key to prevent unauthorized access. The API documentation should provide clear instructions on how to obtain and use your authentication credentials.</p>
<h3 id="endpoints">Endpoints</h3>
<p>The API endpoints specify the URLs to access different functionalities within the BugHerd system. Each endpoint will have a unique path and HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) associated with it. The API documentation will provide a complete list of available endpoints, along with detailed descriptions of each endpoint’s purpose and functionality. Endpoints are typically organized logically to facilitate navigation and ease of use.</p>
<h3 id="request-parameters">Request Parameters</h3>
<p>Many API endpoints accept request parameters to filter, sort, or modify the requested data. These parameters are usually included in the request URL or as part of the request body, depending on the HTTP method. The API documentation will clearly define each request parameter, including its data type, whether it’s required or optional, and its effect on the response. Understanding request parameters enables you to customize your API requests to obtain the specific data you need.</p>
<h3 id="response-codes">Response Codes</h3>
<p>The BugHerd API returns HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) will be used to communicate the outcome. The API documentation should provide a comprehensive list of all possible response codes and their meanings. Pay close attention to error codes, as they provide valuable information for troubleshooting API requests.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limits">Rate Limits</h3>
<p>To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API, BugHerd might impose rate limits on the number of API requests you can make within a specific time period. These limits are typically defined in terms of requests per minute or per hour. Exceeding the rate limit will typically result in an error response. The API documentation will clearly specify the rate limits, enabling you to design your applications to respect these constraints and avoid exceeding the allowed thresholds.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h3>
<p>Proper error handling is essential for building robust applications that interact with the BugHerd API. The API should return informative error messages, either in the HTTP response body or headers, when an error occurs. These messages will typically provide details about the nature of the error, such as invalid input, authentication failures, or rate limit exceeding. Your application should be designed to gracefully handle these errors, preventing unexpected behavior and providing appropriate feedback to the user. The API documentation should provide guidelines on interpreting and handling various error scenarios.</p>
