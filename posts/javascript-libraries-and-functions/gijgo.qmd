```html
<table id="myGrid"></table>

<script>
  $("#myGrid").grid({
    dataSource: [
      { name: "John Doe", age: 30 },
      { name: "Jane Doe", age: 25 }
    ],
    columns: [
      { field: "name", title: "Name" },
      { field: "age", title: "Age" }
    ]
  });
</script>
```

Remember to include jQuery if required by the Gijgo version you're using.  Consult the Gijgo documentation for the most up-to-date initialization code.


### Data Binding

The `dataSource` option allows you to bind data to the grid.  This can be an array of JavaScript objects, a JSON object, or a URL pointing to a remote data source.  For example:

* **Array:**  As shown in the basic usage example above.
* **JSON:**
```javascript
$("#myGrid").grid({
  dataSource: {
    url: "data.json", // URL to JSON data
    dataType: "json"
  },
  columns: [...]
});
```
* **Remote Data (AJAX):**  Use the `url` property within the `dataSource` object to specify a URL that returns data in a format the grid can understand (usually JSON).  The grid will automatically make an AJAX request to fetch the data.  Configuration options for AJAX requests (like `type`, `data`, `headers`, etc.) will be available.


### Columns and Headers

The `columns` option defines the columns displayed in the grid. Each column is an object with properties like `field` (the data field name), `title` (the column header text), `type` (data type), `width`, `format`, and more.  Examples:

```javascript
columns: [
  { field: "name", title: "Name", width: 150 },
  { field: "age", title: "Age", type: "number" },
  { field: "date", title: "Date", type: "date", format: "yyyy-MM-dd" }
]
```


### Filtering and Sorting

Users can filter and sort data directly within the grid.  The grid typically provides built-in support for sorting by clicking column headers and may offer filtering options (e.g., input fields for text filtering).
