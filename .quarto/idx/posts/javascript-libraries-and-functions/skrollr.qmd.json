It allows you to create visually engaging websites with smooth, animated scrolling effects by linking elements' positions and properties to the page's scroll position.  Essentially, it enables you to animate elements based on how far the user has scrolled down the page. This creates a sense of depth and movement, enhancing the user experience.  Skrollr handles all the complex calculations and animation, allowing developers to focus on creating compelling visual designs.\n\n### Why use Skrollr?\n\n* **Simplicity:** Skrollr boasts a clean and straightforward API, making it incredibly easy to learn and implement, even for developers new to parallax scrolling.\n* **Performance:**  Designed for efficiency, Skrollr minimizes performance overhead, ensuring smooth scrolling even on less powerful devices. It cleverly utilizes requestAnimationFrame for optimized animation.\n* **Lightweight:** Its small file size adds minimal weight to your website, contributing to faster loading times.\n* **Flexibility:**  Skrollr provides a range of customization options allowing you to fine-tune animations and create unique scrolling effects.\n* **No dependencies:** Skrollr works independently, requiring no external libraries or frameworks, simplifying integration into your projects.\n\n### Setting up Skrollr\n\nTo use Skrollr, you first need to include the Skrollr JavaScript file in your project. You can download it from the official repository or use a CDN.  After including the script, initialize Skrollr on the `body` element:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Skrollr Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"> </head>\n<body>\n\n  <div id=\"element1\" data-0=\"left:0; opacity:1;\" data-1000=\"left:1000px; opacity:0;\"></div>\n  <script src=\"skrollr.js\"></script>\n  <script>\n    skrollr.init();\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"skrollr.js\"` with the actual path to your Skrollr file.  This basic setup initializes Skrollr, preparing it to handle data attributes on your HTML elements.  \n\n### Basic Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple parallax scrolling effect.  An element (`#element1`) moves from left to right and fades out as the user scrolls down the page.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Skrollr Example</title>\n  <style>\n    body { height: 2000px; } /* Ensure sufficient scrollable height */\n    #element1 { \n      position: absolute;\n      width: 100px; \n      height: 100px; \n      background-color: red; \n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <div id=\"element1\" data-0=\"left:0; opacity:1;\" data-1000=\"left:1000px; opacity:0;\"></div>\n\n  <script src=\"skrollr.js\"></script>\n  <script>\n    skrollr.init();\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe `data-0=\"left:0; opacity:1;\"` attribute defines the element's initial state at the top of the page (scroll position 0).  `data-1000=\"left:1000px; opacity:0;\"` sets its state at scroll position 1000 pixels.  Skrollr smoothly interpolates between these states as the user scrolls.  Remember to adjust the body height to allow for sufficient scrolling.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Scroll Events\n\nSkrollr doesn't directly expose traditional scroll events like `onscroll`. Instead, it manages the scroll process internally for optimal performance.  However, you can indirectly trigger actions based on scroll position changes by utilizing the power of data attributes and Skrollr's internal animation system. Changes in scroll position automatically trigger updates to elements with defined data attributes, effectively acting as event-driven responses.  You don't need to listen for explicit scroll events; the animation defined within your data attributes takes care of the reactivity.\n\n\n### Data Attributes\n\nData attributes are the core of Skrollr's functionality.  They define how an element's CSS properties change in relation to the scroll position.  The attributes follow a specific format: `data-[scroll-position]=\"CSS-properties\"`.  \n\n* **`scroll-position`**: This is a numerical value representing the scroll position in pixels.  Multiple data attributes can be used to define different states at various scroll positions.  For example, `data-0=\"...\"`, `data-500=\"...\"`, `data-1000=\"...\"` would define states at 0, 500, and 1000 pixels of scroll offset respectively.\n* **`CSS-properties`**: This defines the CSS properties and their values for the element at the specified scroll position.  Multiple properties can be separated by semicolons. For example: `left:100px; opacity:0.5;`.\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<div data-0=\"left:0px; opacity:1\" data-500=\"left:500px; opacity:0\"></div>\n```\n\nThis snippet moves the div 500px to the right and fades it out as the user scrolls from 0 to 500 pixels.\n\n\n### Scroll Anchors\n\nSkrollr allows you to define scroll anchors – specific points on the page that trigger animation changes.  This provides more precise control over the animation timeline. Scroll anchors are defined using the `data-anchor-target` attribute.  This attribute specifies a target element that Skrollr will use to determine the scroll position for the animation.\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"anchor-point\"></div>\n<div data-anchor-target=\"#anchor-point\" data-0=\"top:0\" data-100=\"top:100px\"></div>\n```\n\nHere, the animation of the second `div` is anchored to the `#anchor-point` element.  The animation's 0 and 100 values relate to the distance from the `#anchor-point`'s position, not the overall page scroll position.\n\n\n### Easing Functions\n\nEasing functions control the speed and smoothness of animations.  Skrollr uses a syntax similar to jQuery's `animate()` function for specifying easing.  You can use built-in easing functions or custom ones.  Common easing functions include `linear`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`, `easeInOut`, and more. You can often specify these directly within the CSS properties in your data attributes. Some implementations might require specific naming conventions like  `skrollr-easing-linear`.  Refer to Skrollr's documentation for the precise syntax and supported easing functions in your version.\n\nExample (syntax might vary depending on version):\n\n```html\n<div data-0=\"left:0px; easing:easeInSine\" data-500=\"left:500px\"></div>\n```\n\n\n\n### Plugins\n\nSkrollr's core functionality can be extended through plugins. While Skrollr itself doesn't provide many built-in plugins, its architecture allows developers to create custom plugins to add new features or modify existing behavior. These plugins usually provide new data attribute options or functionalities that expand what can be accomplished with Skrollr's animations. You'll need to find and incorporate these plugins separately from the main Skrollr library.  Look for community-contributed plugins in the Skrollr repository or other online resources for more advanced animation techniques and effects.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `skrollr.init([options])`\n\nInitializes Skrollr. This is the primary function to start the parallax scrolling.  Options can be passed as an object to customize Skrollr's behavior. Consult the Skrollr documentation for available options (e.g., `forceHeight`, `smoothScrolling`, `mobileDeceleration`).\n\n```javascript\nskrollr.init({ smoothScrolling: false, forceHeight:false });\n```\n\n\n### `skrollr.destroy()`\n\nStops Skrollr and removes all its event listeners. This is useful for cleaning up when you no longer need parallax scrolling.  After calling this, you will need to call `skrollr.init()` again to re-enable it.\n\n\n### `skrollr.get()`\n\nReturns the current scroll position. This is useful for getting the current scroll position of the page which Skrollr is managing.\n\n```javascript\nlet currentScrollPosition = skrollr.get();\nconsole.log(currentScrollPosition);\n```\n\n\n### `skrollr.animateTo(y, [duration, [easing]])`\n\nAnimates the scroll position to a specific vertical position (`y`).  You can optionally specify the duration (in milliseconds) and the easing function. Note that the easing functionality might depend on your Skrollr version and configuration.\n\n```javascript\nskrollr.animateTo(500, 1000, 'easeInOutCubic'); // Scrolls to position 500px in 1 second\n```\n\n\n### `skrollr.isMobile()`\n\nReturns a boolean value indicating whether the browser is running on a mobile device (based on user agent). This can be useful for conditional logic in your application, to adjust the parallax effects based on the user's device.\n\n\n### `skrollr.version`\n\nA read-only property containing the current version of Skrollr.\n\n\n### `skrollr.config`\n\nProvides access to Skrollr's configuration.  Allows you to inspect the currently active settings. Note that directly modifying this object might not always be supported and could have unpredictable results.   It's generally best to set options during initialization (`skrollr.init()`) instead.\n\n\n### `skrollr.goto(y)`\n\nInstantly scrolls to a specific vertical position (`y`). This will jump the scroll position without animation, unlike `animateTo`.\n\n\n### `skrollr.stop()`\n\nStops any currently running animations.  This can be useful if you want to interrupt an ongoing animation initiated by `animateTo`.  If no animation is currently running, this call will have no effect.\n\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Using JavaScript to Control Skrollr\n\nWhile Skrollr primarily uses data attributes for animation definitions, you can dynamically control aspects of its behavior using JavaScript.  You can modify data attributes on elements, triggering changes in their animations, or use the API functions like `skrollr.animateTo()` and `skrollr.goto()` for programmatic scroll control.  This allows for interactive elements and dynamic updates to your parallax effects. For example, you can trigger animations based on user interactions or other events.\n\n\n```javascript\n//Example of modifying a data attribute:\nlet element = document.getElementById('myElement');\nelement.setAttribute('data-1000', 'left:500px; opacity:0'); // Change animation at scroll position 1000\nskrollr.refresh(element); // tell skrollr to re-calculate the animation.\n\n// Example of programmatic scrolling:\nskrollr.animateTo(1500, 1000); // Scroll to 1500px over 1 second\n```\n\nRemember to call `skrollr.refresh()` after modifying data attributes to ensure Skrollr updates its internal calculations.\n\n\n### Custom Easing Functions\n\nSkrollr allows for the implementation of custom easing functions to fine-tune animation behavior beyond the built-in options.  The exact method for implementing custom easing functions varies depending on the Skrollr version and implementation.  Consult the Skrollr documentation for specifics on registering and using your custom easing functions.  Typically, this involves creating a function that accepts a progress value (between 0 and 1) and returns the corresponding easing value.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Plugins\n\nSkrollr's architecture supports extending its functionality through plugins. This involves creating JavaScript modules that add new features or modify existing behavior. The plugin mechanism usually involves registering the plugin with Skrollr, adding new data attribute options or functions that Skrollr can process and act upon.  Refer to the Skrollr documentation or examples to learn the specific process of plugin creation.\n\n\n### Handling Scroll Events (Indirectly)\n\nSkrollr doesn't offer direct scroll event listeners.  Instead, you achieve similar functionality by using data attributes to define animations that respond to changes in the scroll position.  By cleverly defining multiple states at different scroll positions, you can effectively trigger actions as if you were handling scroll events. The visual updates themselves are the \"events\".\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nTo optimize Skrollr's performance:\n\n* **Minimize the number of animated elements:**  Only animate the elements that are truly necessary.\n* **Use simple animations:** Complex animations can impact performance.\n* **Optimize CSS selectors:** Use efficient CSS selectors to improve rendering speed.\n* **Avoid unnecessary calculations:**  Keep your data attribute definitions concise and efficient.\n* **Use lightweight images:** Large images can significantly slow down scrolling.\n\n### Working with Different Browsers\n\nSkrollr generally offers good cross-browser compatibility. However, minor rendering differences might occur across different browsers due to variations in CSS rendering and JavaScript engine performance. Thorough testing across multiple browsers and devices is crucial to ensure consistency.\n\n### Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\nDebugging Skrollr applications involves standard web development debugging techniques.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect CSS styles, check for JavaScript errors, and examine the DOM structure.  Pay close attention to data attribute values and ensure they are correctly defined and updated.  If performance issues arise, profile your application using your browser's performance tools to identify bottlenecks.  If you encounter unexpected behavior, consult the Skrollr documentation and community forums for assistance.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\n### Parallax Scrolling\n\nParallax scrolling is Skrollr's primary use case.  By assigning different `data-*` attributes to elements, you can create the illusion of depth as the user scrolls. Background elements move slower than foreground elements, creating a 3D-like effect.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"background\" data-0=\"top:0; left:0\" data-1000=\"top:-200px; left:0\"></div>\n<div class=\"foreground\" data-0=\"top:100px; left:0\" data-1000=\"top:0; left:0\"></div>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `background` element moves upward more slowly than the `foreground` element as the user scrolls.\n\n\n### Animations on Scroll\n\nSkrollr simplifies the creation of various animations triggered by the scroll position.  You can animate any CSS property – opacity, transforms, colors, etc. –  to create engaging visual effects.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"animated-element\" data-0=\"opacity:0; transform:scale(0.5)\" data-500=\"opacity:1; transform:scale(1)\"></div>\n```\n\nThis element fades in and scales up as the user scrolls past the 500px mark.\n\n\n### Sticky Navigation\n\nCreate a navigation bar that stays fixed to the top of the viewport once the user scrolls past a certain point.\n\n```html\n<nav id=\"navigation\" data-0=\"position:relative; top:0\" data-100=\"position:fixed; top:0\"></nav>\n```\n\nThis simple example fixes the navigation (`#navigation`) to the top of the viewport after a scroll of 100px. You'll likely need additional CSS to style the navigation bar appropriately.\n\n\n### Progress Bars\n\nVisualize progress as the user scrolls through the page.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"progress-bar\" data-0=\"width:0%\" data-1000=\"width:100%\"></div>\n```\n\nThis fills a progress bar to 100% as the user scrolls down 1000px. You would need to style the `.progress-bar` element appropriately using CSS.\n\n\n### Background Image Changes\n\nChange background images based on the scroll position.  While Skrollr directly animates CSS properties, you can combine it with JavaScript to alter background images.\n\n```javascript\n//Example (requires JavaScript):\nlet bgImageElement = document.getElementById('background-image');\nlet scrollListener = skrollr.get().scroll(); // Get skrollr's scroll object (implementation-specific)\n\nscrollListener.on('change', function(scrollPos) {\n    if(scrollPos > 500){\n        bgImageElement.style.backgroundImage = \"url('image2.jpg')\";\n    } else {\n        bgImageElement.style.backgroundImage = \"url('image1.jpg')\";\n    }\n})\n\n```\nThis example switches the background image of an element based on the scroll position. Note that this example assumes that `skrollr.get().scroll()` returns an object with an `on` method for event handling; the precise method to hook into scroll events might vary depending on your Skrollr version and how it's implemented. You might need to adapt the code to match your specific context.  This example highlights how to use Skrollr in tandem with other JavaScript to achieve more complex effects that aren't directly possible with just data attributes.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and FAQs\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Animations not working:** Double-check your data attributes for typos and ensure that the scroll positions and CSS properties are correctly specified.  Verify that Skrollr is initialized correctly (`skrollr.init()`) and that the script is included properly.  Also, check the browser's developer console for JavaScript errors.  Make sure the elements you are trying to animate have the correct positioning properties (e.g., `position: relative` or `position: absolute`).\n\n* **Elements not appearing at expected positions:** Inspect the CSS of your elements to ensure that the `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, etc., values are not being overridden by other stylesheets. Check for conflicting CSS rules. The parent element might need `overflow:hidden` if there are layout issues.\n\n\n* **Unexpected animation behavior:**  Make sure you've correctly chosen your easing functions if they are used. Incorrect easing function syntax could produce unexpected results.\n\n\n* **No response after `skrollr.animateTo()` or `skrollr.goto()`:** Ensure that the values passed to these methods are valid numbers representing pixel positions.\n\n* **Animations jerky or laggy:** This is often related to performance issues.  See the \"Performance Problems\" section below for potential solutions.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nSkrollr generally works across modern browsers, but minor rendering differences or quirks might exist due to variations in CSS rendering or JavaScript engine optimization.  Thorough testing on different browsers and versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) is recommended.  Older browsers might require polyfills or specific CSS hacks for complete compatibility.  It's generally a good practice to always test on your target browsers.\n\n\n### Performance Problems\n\n* **Too many animated elements:** Reduce the number of elements being animated by Skrollr.  Only animate elements that are truly necessary.\n\n* **Complex animations:** Simplify animations.  Avoid excessive use of computationally expensive CSS transformations.\n\n* **Large images:** Use optimized images that are appropriately sized for the screen.  Overly large images can slow down scrolling significantly.\n\n* **Inefficient CSS selectors:** Ensure that CSS selectors are highly specific and well-optimized.  Avoid overly generic selectors.\n\n* **Lack of `overflow: hidden` on parent containers:** Without `overflow: hidden`, the browser might do extra work as it lays out the elements. If your Skrollr elements are inside a container, ensure it has `overflow: hidden;`.\n\n* **Heavy JavaScript operations:**  Avoid running computationally intensive JavaScript code within event listeners tied to Skrollr.  If possible, separate this logic to be done on intervals or when needed, not in each scroll event.\n\nTo improve performance, you can use the browser's developer tools to profile your application and identify bottlenecks. Consider using tools like the browser's profiler to measure CPU and GPU usage.\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* **Can I use Skrollr with other JavaScript libraries?** Yes, generally, but ensure there are no conflicts between their event handling mechanisms.\n\n* **How do I add custom easing functions?** The process for adding custom easing functions is implementation-dependent and would be described in the Skrollr documentation for your specific version.\n\n* **Why isn't my animation smooth?**  Check for performance issues (see the \"Performance Problems\" section). Ensure correct CSS styling and efficient data attribute usage.\n\n* **Can Skrollr handle very long pages?** While Skrollr can handle long pages, performance might degrade with extremely lengthy content.  Consider optimizing images and minimizing the number of animated elements.\n\n* **What's the best way to debug Skrollr issues?** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS and JavaScript, check the console for errors, and use the profiler to diagnose performance bottlenecks.  Consider simplifying your code to isolate problems.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n### What is Skrollr?\n\nSkrollr is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use parallax scrolling library for the web.

For example, you can trigger animations based on user interactions or other events.\n\n\n```javascript\n//Example of modifying a data attribute:\nlet element = document.getElementById('myElement');\nelement.setAttribute('data-1000', 'left:500px; opacity:0'); // Change animation at scroll position 1000\nskrollr.refresh(element); // tell skrollr to re-calculate the animation.\n\n// Example of programmatic scrolling:\nskrollr.animateTo(1500, 1000); // Scroll to 1500px over 1 second\n```\n\nRemember to call `skrollr.refresh()` after modifying data attributes to ensure Skrollr updates its internal calculations.\n\n\n### Custom Easing Functions\n\nSkrollr allows for the implementation of custom easing functions to fine-tune animation behavior beyond the built-in options.  The exact method for implementing custom easing functions varies depending on the Skrollr version and implementation.  Consult the Skrollr documentation for specifics on registering and using your custom easing functions.  Typically, this involves creating a function that accepts a progress value (between 0 and 1) and returns the corresponding easing value.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Plugins\n\nSkrollr's architecture supports extending its functionality through plugins. This involves creating JavaScript modules that add new features or modify existing behavior. The plugin mechanism usually involves registering the plugin with Skrollr, adding new data attribute options or functions that Skrollr can process and act upon.  Refer to the Skrollr documentation or examples to learn the specific process of plugin creation.\n\n\n### Handling Scroll Events (Indirectly)\n\nSkrollr doesn't offer direct scroll event listeners.  Instead, you achieve similar functionality by using data attributes to define animations that respond to changes in the scroll position.  By cleverly defining multiple states at different scroll positions, you can effectively trigger actions as if you were handling scroll events. The visual updates themselves are the \"events\".\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nTo optimize Skrollr's performance:\n\n* **Minimize the number of animated elements:**  Only animate the elements that are truly necessary.\n* **Use simple animations:** Complex animations can impact performance.\n* **Optimize CSS selectors:** Use efficient CSS selectors to improve rendering speed.\n* **Avoid unnecessary calculations:**  Keep your data attribute definitions concise and efficient.\n* **Use lightweight images:** Large images can significantly slow down scrolling.\n\n### Working with Different Browsers\n\nSkrollr generally offers good cross-browser compatibility. However, minor rendering differences might occur across different browsers due to variations in CSS rendering and JavaScript engine performance. Thorough testing across multiple browsers and devices is crucial to ensure consistency.\n\n### Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\nDebugging Skrollr applications involves standard web development debugging techniques.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect CSS styles, check for JavaScript errors, and examine the DOM structure.  Pay close attention to data attribute values and ensure they are correctly defined and updated.  If performance issues arise, profile your application using your browser's performance tools to identify bottlenecks.  If you encounter unexpected behavior, consult the Skrollr documentation and community forums for assistance.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\n### Parallax Scrolling\n\nParallax scrolling is Skrollr's primary use case.  By assigning different `data-*` attributes to elements, you can create the illusion of depth as the user scrolls. Background elements move slower than foreground elements, creating a 3D-like effect.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"background\" data-0=\"top:0; left:0\" data-1000=\"top:-200px; left:0\"></div>\n<div class=\"foreground\" data-0=\"top:100px; left:0\" data-1000=\"top:0; left:0\"></div>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `background` element moves upward more slowly than the `foreground` element as the user scrolls.\n\n\n### Animations on Scroll\n\nSkrollr simplifies the creation of various animations triggered by the scroll position.  You can animate any CSS property – opacity, transforms, colors, etc. –  to create engaging visual effects.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"animated-element\" data-0=\"opacity:0; transform:scale(0.5)\" data-500=\"opacity:1; transform:scale(1)\"></div>\n```\n\nThis element fades in and scales up as the user scrolls past the 500px mark.\n\n\n### Sticky Navigation\n\nCreate a navigation bar that stays fixed to the top of the viewport once the user scrolls past a certain point.\n\n```html\n<nav id=\"navigation\" data-0=\"position:relative; top:0\" data-100=\"position:fixed; top:0\"></nav>\n```\n\nThis simple example fixes the navigation (`#navigation`) to the top of the viewport after a scroll of 100px. You'll likely need additional CSS to style the navigation bar appropriately.\n\n\n### Progress Bars\n\nVisualize progress as the user scrolls through the page.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"progress-bar\" data-0=\"width:0%\" data-1000=\"width:100%\"></div>\n```\n\nThis fills a progress bar to 100% as the user scrolls down 1000px. You would need to style the `.progress-bar` element appropriately using CSS.\n\n\n### Background Image Changes\n\nChange background images based on the scroll position.  While Skrollr directly animates CSS properties, you can combine it with JavaScript to alter background images.\n\n```javascript\n//Example (requires JavaScript):\nlet bgImageElement = document.getElementById('background-image');\nlet scrollListener = skrollr.get().scroll(); // Get skrollr's scroll object (implementation-specific)\n\nscrollListener.on('change', function(scrollPos) {\n    if(scrollPos > 500){\n        bgImageElement.style.backgroundImage = \"url('image2.jpg')\";\n    } else {\n        bgImageElement.style.backgroundImage = \"url('image1.jpg')\";\n    }\n})\n\n```\nThis example switches the background image of an element based on the scroll position. Note that this example assumes that `skrollr.get().scroll()` returns an object with an `on` method for event handling; the precise method to hook into scroll events might vary depending on your Skrollr version and how it's implemented. You might need to adapt the code to match your specific context.  This example highlights how to use Skrollr in tandem with other JavaScript to achieve more complex effects that aren't directly possible with just data attributes.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and FAQs\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Animations not working:** Double-check your data attributes for typos and ensure that the scroll positions and CSS properties are correctly specified.  Verify that Skrollr is initialized correctly (`skrollr.init()`) and that the script is included properly.  Also, check the browser's developer console for JavaScript errors.  Make sure the elements you are trying to animate have the correct positioning properties (e.g., `position: relative` or `position: absolute`).\n\n* **Elements not appearing at expected positions:** Inspect the CSS of your elements to ensure that the `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, etc., values are not being overridden by other stylesheets. Check for conflicting CSS rules. The parent element might need `overflow:hidden` if there are layout issues.\n\n\n* **Unexpected animation behavior:**  Make sure you've correctly chosen your easing functions if they are used. Incorrect easing function syntax could produce unexpected results.\n\n\n* **No response after `skrollr.animateTo()` or `skrollr.goto()`:** Ensure that the values passed to these methods are valid numbers representing pixel positions.\n\n* **Animations jerky or laggy:** This is often related to performance issues.  See the \"Performance Problems\" section below for potential solutions.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nSkrollr generally works across modern browsers, but minor rendering differences or quirks might exist due to variations in CSS rendering or JavaScript engine optimization.  Thorough testing on different browsers and versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) is recommended.  Older browsers might require polyfills or specific CSS hacks for complete compatibility.  It's generally a good practice to always test on your target browsers.\n\n\n### Performance Problems\n\n* **Too many animated elements:** Reduce the number of elements being animated by Skrollr.  Only animate elements that are truly necessary.\n\n* **Complex animations:** Simplify animations.  Avoid excessive use of computationally expensive CSS transformations.\n\n* **Large images:** Use optimized images that are appropriately sized for the screen.  Overly large images can slow down scrolling significantly.\n\n* **Inefficient CSS selectors:** Ensure that CSS selectors are highly specific and well-optimized.  Avoid overly generic selectors.\n\n* **Lack of `overflow: hidden` on parent containers:** Without `overflow: hidden`, the browser might do extra work as it lays out the elements. If your Skrollr elements are inside a container, ensure it has `overflow: hidden;`.\n\n* **Heavy JavaScript operations:**  Avoid running computationally intensive JavaScript code within event listeners tied to Skrollr.  If possible, separate this logic to be done on intervals or when needed, not in each scroll event.\n\nTo improve performance, you can use the browser's developer tools to profile your application and identify bottlenecks. Consider using tools like the browser's profiler to measure CPU and GPU usage.\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* **Can I use Skrollr with other JavaScript libraries?** Yes, generally, but ensure there are no conflicts between their event handling mechanisms.\n\n* **How do I add custom easing functions?** The process for adding custom easing functions is implementation-dependent and would be described in the Skrollr documentation for your specific version.\n\n* **Why isn't my animation smooth?**  Check for performance issues (see the \"Performance Problems\" section). Ensure correct CSS styling and efficient data attribute usage.\n\n* **Can Skrollr handle very long pages?** While Skrollr can handle long pages, performance might degrade with extremely lengthy content.  Consider optimizing images and minimizing the number of animated elements.\n\n* **What's the best way to debug Skrollr issues?** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS and JavaScript, check the console for errors, and use the profiler to diagnose performance bottlenecks.  Consider simplifying your code to isolate problems.\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
