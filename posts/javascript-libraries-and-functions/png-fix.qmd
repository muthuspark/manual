## Introduction

### What is PNG Fix?

PNG Fix is a command-line utility and library designed to repair corrupted PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image files. It employs a variety of techniques to identify and correct common PNG errors, allowing users to recover data from otherwise unusable images.  It prioritizes data preservation, attempting to restore as much of the original image as possible while maintaining the integrity of the repaired file.  PNG Fix is built for speed and efficiency, handling both single files and batches of images.

### Features and Capabilities

* **Error Detection:**  Identifies a wide range of PNG errors, including CRC checksum failures, IHDR inconsistencies, data stream corruption, and more.
* **Data Repair:**  Attempts to repair detected errors using various algorithms, including byte-level correction and data reconstruction techniques.
* **Partial Recovery:**  Even if complete repair is impossible, PNG Fix can often salvage portions of the image data, providing a usable partial recovery.
* **Batch Processing:**  Allows for efficient processing of multiple PNG files simultaneously, significantly reducing overall processing time.
* **Error Reporting:** Provides detailed information about detected errors and the repair actions undertaken, enabling developers and users to understand the repair process.
* **Lossless Repair:** PNG Fix is designed to perform lossless repairs.  While some data loss may be unavoidable in severely corrupted files, it strives to maintain the original image quality in repaired portions.
* **Library Integration:**  The core functionality of PNG Fix is available as a library, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate PNG repair capabilities into their own applications.

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

PNG Fix can be used in two primary ways: via the command-line interface (CLI) for individual file or batch processing, and via its API for integration into other applications.  The simplest way to use PNG Fix is to provide the path to a corrupted PNG file as a command-line argument. The tool will attempt to repair the file, creating a repaired version (usually with "_fixed" appended to the original filename). If the repair is successful, the repaired file will be saved in the same directory. If the repair fails, an error message will be displayed.  In either case, a log file (optional, depending on settings) will contain detailed information about the repair process.


### Command-Line Interface

The command-line interface offers a flexible and efficient way to use PNG Fix.  The basic syntax is:

`pngfix [options] <input_file> [<input_file2> ...]`

Where:

* `<input_file>`: Path to the corrupted PNG file (or files).  Multiple files can be specified to process them in batch.
* `[options]`: Optional command-line arguments to control PNG Fix's behavior.  Common options include:
    * `-o <output_dir>`: Specify an output directory for the repaired files (defaults to the input directory).
    * `-l <log_file>`: Specify a log file for detailed output.
    * `-v`: Increase verbosity level for more detailed console output.
    * `--force`: Overwrite existing files without prompting (use with caution).
    * `--no-backup`: Do not create backup copies of original files before attempting repair.
    * `--help`: Display help information.

A full list of available command-line options can be found by running `pngfix --help`.


### API Usage

For developers integrating PNG Fix into their applications, a well-documented API is provided.  The API allows for programmatic control over the repair process, enabling customization and integration into existing workflows.  The API is designed to be easy to use and highly efficient.  Key functions typically include:

* `pngfix_repair(input_file_path, output_file_path, options)`: This core function attempts to repair a PNG file.  The `options` parameter allows for setting various parameters, such as verbosity level and error handling behaviour.
* `pngfix_get_error()` : Retrieves the error code from the last operation.
* `pngfix_get_error_message()` : Retrieves a descriptive error message associated with the last error code.
* `pngfix_get_log()`: Retrieves the detailed log of the repair process.

Refer to the included API documentation (`API.md` or similar) for a detailed explanation of all functions, parameters, and data structures.  The API is typically implemented as a shared library (`.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`) that can be linked into your application.


### Example: Fixing a Corrupted PNG

Let's assume you have a corrupted PNG file named `broken_image.png`.

**Command-line usage:**

To repair the file using the command-line interface and save the result to a directory called "repaired_images", you would use the following command:

```bash
pngfix -o repaired_images broken_image.png
```

This will create a file named `broken_image_fixed.png` in the `repaired_images` directory containing the repaired image (if successful). A log file might also be generated depending on the options used.


**API usage (example C++):**

A simplified C++ example (assuming a header file `pngfix.h` and library `libpngfix.so` are available):

```cpp
#include "pngfix.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int result = pngfix_repair("broken_image.png", "repaired_image.png", 0); // 0 for default options
  if (result != 0) {
    std::cerr << "Error repairing image: " << pngfix_get_error_message() << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }
  std::cout << "Image repaired successfully." << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Remember to compile this code with the appropriate flags to link against the PNG Fix library.  Consult the project's documentation for specific compilation instructions.


## Advanced Usage

### Working with Multiple Files

PNG Fix efficiently handles multiple PNG files.  For command-line usage, simply list all the file paths as arguments.  For example:

```bash
pngfix image1.png image2.png corrupted_image.png
```

PNG Fix will process each file individually, creating repaired versions (with "_fixed" appended) in the same directory unless an output directory is specified using the `-o` option.  For API usage, you will need to call the repair function iteratively for each file, handling the results accordingly.


### Batch Processing

For large numbers of files, batch processing is crucial.  The command-line interface already supports this by accepting multiple file arguments, but you can enhance it by scripting.  A simple shell script can iterate through a directory, processing each PNG file.  For API usage, consider creating a loop that iterates through a list of file paths, calling the `pngfix_repair` function for each.  Progress indicators can be added to provide feedback during batch processing.  Error handling should be implemented to manage failures gracefully for individual files within a batch.

Example shell script (bash):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.png; do
  pngfix -o repaired_images "$file"
done
```


### Customizing Repair Options

Both the command-line interface and API provide mechanisms for customizing the repair process.

**Command-line:** Use various command-line options (e.g., `-v` for verbosity, `-l` for log file, `--force`, `--no-backup`) to fine-tune the behavior.  Consult the `pngfix --help` output for the complete list of options.

**API:**  The `options` parameter in the `pngfix_repair` API function allows for advanced customization.  This might involve flags or structs representing specific repair strategies, thresholds, or logging preferences.  Consult the API documentation for specifics on available options.  Customizing these parameters allows for tailoring the repair process to specific needs, potentially increasing the success rate or optimizing for particular types of corruption.


### Handling Errors and Exceptions

Robust error handling is critical.

**Command-line:** PNG Fix will typically report errors to the console. Carefully examine the output for error messages and warnings to understand the outcome of the repair process for each file.

**API:** The API provides functions like `pngfix_get_error()` and `pngfix_get_error_message()` to retrieve error codes and descriptions.  Your application should implement appropriate error handling based on these return values, such as logging errors, providing feedback to the user, or skipping failed files during batch processing.  A well-designed error handling mechanism ensures that the application doesn't crash due to unexpected input or repair failures.  Consider using try-catch blocks (or equivalent error handling mechanisms in your chosen programming language) to manage potential exceptions.


### Performance Optimization

For large-scale processing, performance optimization is crucial.

**Command-line:** Utilize batch processing and appropriate command-line options to minimize overhead.

**API:** Optimize API calls by reducing unnecessary function calls and data transfers. Consider multithreading or multiprocessing to process files concurrently (if the library supports it).  Efficient memory management helps avoid excessive memory consumption, especially when handling large images.  Profiling tools can identify performance bottlenecks within your applicationâ€™s code or within the PNG Fix library itself.  The library developers may have specific recommendations for performance optimization based on the underlying algorithms.  If the library supports it, consider using memory mapping to reduce I/O overhead.


## API Reference

### `fixPng(filePath, options)`

This function initiates an asynchronous repair process for a given PNG file.  It returns immediately, allowing your application to continue executing other tasks while the repair happens in the background.  The results, including success or failure status and any error messages, will be available through an event listener (see the Events section below).

**Parameters:**

* `filePath` (string):  The absolute or relative path to the corrupted PNG file.
* `options` (object): An object containing optional settings for the repair process. See the "Available Options" section below.

**Return Value:**  `void`.  This function does not return the repair results directly.  Results are delivered asynchronously via events.

### `fixPngSync(filePath, options)`

This function performs a synchronous repair of a PNG file. The function blocks until the repair process is complete, returning the result immediately.  This approach is suitable for situations where you need the repair result before continuing.

**Parameters:**

* `filePath` (string): The absolute or relative path to the corrupted PNG file.
* `options` (object): An object containing optional settings for the repair process.  See the "Available Options" section below.

**Return Value:** An object containing the repair result.  This object will include:
    * `success` (boolean): `true` if the repair was successful, `false` otherwise.
    * `filePath` (string): Path to the repaired file (or null if repair failed).
    * `error` (string, optional): An error message if the repair failed.


### Available Options

The `options` object can contain the following properties:

* `outputDir` (string, optional):  Specifies the directory where the repaired file should be saved. If not provided, the repaired file will be saved in the same directory as the input file.
* `overwrite` (boolean, optional): If `true`, allows overwriting an existing file at the output path. Defaults to `false`.
* `backup` (boolean, optional): If `true`, creates a backup copy of the original file before attempting repair. Defaults to `true`.
* `verbose` (boolean, optional): If `true`, enables verbose logging output. Defaults to `false`.
* `logFilePath` (string, optional): Specifies a file path for saving detailed log information.


### Error Handling

Errors during the repair process are handled differently for synchronous and asynchronous calls.

* **`fixPngSync()`:** Returns an object with a `success` flag (`false` on error) and an `error` string containing a detailed error message.  Your code should check the `success` flag and handle errors appropriately.

* **`fixPng()`:** Errors are reported via the `error` event (see Events section).  Your code should attach an event listener to handle error events.  The event object will contain details about the error.

Common error codes might include:  `FILE_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_PNG`, `REPAIR_FAILED`, `IO_ERROR`, etc.  Specific error codes and their meanings will be documented in a separate error code reference.


### Events

The asynchronous `fixPng()` function uses events to communicate the repair progress and results.  You need to add event listeners to your application to handle these events.  The following events are available:

* **`start`:**  Emitted when the repair process begins.  The event object will contain the input file path.
* **`progress`:** Emitted periodically during the repair process, providing information on progress (e.g., percentage complete). The event object will contain the progress percentage.
* **`success`:** Emitted when the repair is successful. The event object will contain the path to the repaired file.
* **`error`:** Emitted when an error occurs during the repair process.  The event object will contain an error code and a detailed error message.
* **`complete`:** Emitted when the repair process is finished (regardless of success or failure).


Example (Illustrative, language-specific syntax may vary):

```javascript
fixPng("broken.png", { verbose: true });

// Add event listeners
pngFix.on("start", (event) => { console.log("Repair started:", event.filePath); });
pngFix.on("progress", (event) => { console.log("Progress:", event.percentage, "%"); });
pngFix.on("success", (event) => { console.log("Repair successful:", event.filePath); });
pngFix.on("error", (event) => { console.error("Repair failed:", event.error); });
pngFix.on("complete", () => { console.log("Repair complete."); });

```


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

* **"Error: File not found":**  Verify that the file path you provided is correct and that the file exists.  Check for typos and ensure the path is absolute or relative to the correct working directory.

* **"Error: Invalid PNG file":** The input file might be severely corrupted or not a valid PNG file. Try a different file or inspect the file's header to confirm its PNG signature.

* **"Error: Repair failed":**  The level of corruption might be too high for PNG Fix to repair. Try alternative repair tools or consider if the data loss is recoverable. Check the detailed error message for more specific clues.

* **"Output file is empty or incorrect":** The repair process might have encountered an unexpected error or the resulting repaired file is not usable due to extensive corruption. Review the log file (if enabled) for clues about the failure.

* **"Slow processing speed":** Processing speed can be affected by the file size, level of corruption, and system resources. For very large files or extensive batch processing, consider optimizing your code or using multi-threading (if supported by the API).

* **"Unexpected behavior or crashes":** Ensure you are using a compatible version of PNG Fix and the required dependencies. Check for any updates or consult the issue tracker for known bugs. Provide detailed information about the problem (steps to reproduce, operating system, version of PNG Fix, error messages) when reporting a bug.


### Debugging Tips

* **Use verbose logging:** Enable verbose logging (`verbose` option) to get detailed information about the repair process. This will help pinpoint the stage where the error occurs.

* **Examine log files:** If you specified a log file path, review its contents for detailed error messages, warnings, and the steps taken during the repair attempt.

* **Check error codes:** Use the appropriate error handling mechanisms (checking return values for synchronous calls or listening for error events in asynchronous calls) to identify specific error codes.  Consult the API documentation for a complete list of error codes and their meanings.

* **Simplify the input:** Test PNG Fix with smaller, simpler PNG files to isolate the issue if you are working with large or complex images.

* **Inspect the corrupted file:** Use a hex editor or other tools to examine the structure of the corrupted PNG file. This might reveal patterns that indicate the type of corruption.

* **Test with known good files:** Try repairing known good PNG files to rule out problems with your setup or code.

* **Use a debugger:** If you are integrating the API into your application, use a debugger to step through your code and examine variables, inspecting the flow of data and identify the points of failure.
