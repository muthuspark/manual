### What is Crypto Browserify?

Crypto Browserify is a browserify transform that allows you to use Node.js crypto libraries directly within your browser-based JavaScript applications.  It handles the complexities of bridging the gap between the Node.js `crypto` module's reliance on native bindings and the browser's JavaScript environment, which lacks direct access to these functionalities.  Essentially, it provides a way to securely perform cryptographic operations (such as hashing, signing, encryption, and decryption) client-side, without needing to rely on external services or potentially insecure third-party libraries.


### Why use Crypto Browserify?

Using Crypto Browserify offers several advantages:

* **Client-side Cryptography:** Perform cryptographic operations directly within the user's browser, eliminating the need to send sensitive data to a server for processing. This reduces the risk of data breaches during transit and enhances the overall security of your application.

* **Improved Security:** Leveraging well-vetted and widely used cryptographic algorithms from the Node.js `crypto` module reduces the chance of introducing vulnerabilities through the use of lesser-known or poorly audited third-party libraries.

* **Simplified Development:** Crypto Browserify streamlines the integration process. You can use familiar Node.js `crypto` API calls within your browser-side code without significant changes to your existing workflow.

* **Portability:** Your cryptographic code remains consistent regardless of whether it's running in a Node.js environment or a browser environment, facilitating easier code reuse and maintenance.


### Key Features and Benefits

* **Node.js `crypto` compatibility:**  Use the same familiar API you're used to from Node.js.
* **Secure and well-tested algorithms:**  Leverage the robust algorithms provided by the Node.js `crypto` module.
* **Browser compatibility:** Works across major modern browsers.
* **Easy integration:**  Simple setup and seamless integration into your existing browserify workflow.
* **Enhanced security posture:** Minimize the risk of insecure code practices and third-party dependencies.



### Setting up your development environment

To use Crypto Browserify, you'll need the following:

1. **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn installed on your system.  You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Browserify:** Install browserify globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g browserify
   ```
   or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn global add browserify
   ```

3. **Crypto Browserify:** Install Crypto Browserify as a development dependency in your project:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev crypto-browserify
   ```
   or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn add --dev crypto-browserify
   ```

4. **Project setup:** Create a simple `index.js` file in your project directory.  This file will contain your cryptographic code. For example:

   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');

   const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
   hash.update('some data');
   console.log(hash.digest('hex'));
   ```

5. **Bundling:** Use browserify to bundle your code, including the Crypto Browserify transform:

   ```bash
   browserify index.js -t [ browserify-aes ] -o bundle.js
   ```

Now you can include `bundle.js` in your HTML file to use your cryptographic functionality in the browser.  Remember to replace `[browserify-aes]` with the correct transform if needed for specific algorithms.  Consult the Crypto Browserify documentation for further details and potential algorithm-specific setup.


## Core Concepts

### Understanding Cryptographic Primitives

Cryptographic primitives are the fundamental building blocks of cryptographic systems.  Crypto Browserify provides access to many of these primitives through the familiar Node.js `crypto` API.  Understanding these primitives is crucial for building secure applications.  Key examples include:

* **Hash Functions:** These algorithms take an input of arbitrary size and produce a fixed-size output (hash).  They are used for data integrity checks and digital signatures.
* **Encryption Algorithms:**  These algorithms transform plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key.  They are crucial for protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest.
* **Digital Signature Algorithms:** These algorithms create digital signatures that provide authentication and non-repudiation.  A digital signature verifies the authenticity and integrity of a message.
* **Message Authentication Codes (MACs):** These provide both data integrity and authentication.  A MAC ensures that the message hasn't been tampered with and that it originates from a trusted source.


### Key Management and Security

Secure key management is paramount in cryptography.  Crypto Browserify doesn't directly handle key generation and storage; it's the developer's responsibility to implement secure key management practices.  Consider these points:

* **Key Generation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNGs) to generate keys.  Crypto Browserify relies on the browser's underlying CSPRNG.  However, ensure your application doesn't rely on the browser's default implementation for generating especially sensitive keys; consider using a dedicated library for key generation if the security requirements are higher.
* **Key Storage:**  Never store keys directly in your client-side code.  For client-side applications, explore using browser storage mechanisms like the Web Crypto API, but be mindful of its limitations regarding security and persistence.  For more secure key management, explore server-side solutions and mechanisms such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).
* **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate your keys to limit the impact of any potential compromise.
* **Key Length:** Choose appropriately sized keys based on the security requirements of your application.  Consult up-to-date security recommendations for optimal key lengths.


### Random Number Generation

Cryptographically secure random number generation (CSPRNG) is essential for secure cryptography.  Crypto Browserify leverages the browser's built-in CSPRNG.  However, it's vital to understand that the security of your application depends on the quality of the underlying CSPRNG provided by the browser. In cases requiring extremely high security (e.g., generating keys for high-value transactions),  consider utilizing a more robust and validated CSPRNG if one is available and appropriate for your platform.


### Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

MACs provide assurance of both data integrity and authenticity.  Crypto Browserify allows the creation of MACs using algorithms like HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code).  HMAC combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to generate a MAC.  Verification involves recomputing the MAC using the same algorithm, key, and message; if the computed MAC matches the received MAC, the message is deemed authentic and unaltered.


### Digital Signatures

Digital signatures offer authentication, non-repudiation, and data integrity.  Crypto Browserify supports digital signature creation and verification using various algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECDSA).  A digital signature ensures that the message originated from a specific entity (authentication), prevents the sender from denying having sent the message (non-repudiation), and guarantees the message hasn't been tampered with (integrity).


### Hashing Algorithms

Hashing algorithms produce a fixed-size output (hash) from an arbitrary input.  They are widely used for data integrity checks, password storage, and digital signatures.  Crypto Browserify supports various hashing algorithms, including SHA-256, SHA-512, and MD5 (though MD5 is considered cryptographically weak and should generally be avoided for security-sensitive applications).  The hash function's output is deterministicâ€”the same input will always produce the same output.


### Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

Crypto Browserify supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

* **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.  Algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are common examples.  Symmetric encryption is generally faster than asymmetric encryption but requires a secure method for key exchange.

* **Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.  RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms. Asymmetric encryption is slower than symmetric encryption but eliminates the need for secure key exchange.  Often used for key exchange in hybrid systems combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption.


## Installation and Setup

### Installing Node.js and npm

Crypto Browserify relies on Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).  If you don't already have them, follow these steps:

1. **Download:** Go to the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. **Install:** Run the installer. This usually involves accepting the default settings and following the on-screen prompts.  The installer will automatically install npm alongside Node.js.

3. **Verification:** Open your terminal or command prompt and type `node -v` and `npm -v`. You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm printed to the console.


### Installing Crypto Browserify

You'll need to install Crypto Browserify as a development dependency within your project.  There are two primary package managers you can use: npm or yarn.

**Using npm:**

1. **Navigate to your project directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project using the `cd` command.

2. **Install Crypto Browserify:** Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev crypto-browserify
   ```
   This installs `crypto-browserify` and adds it to your `package.json` file's `devDependencies` section.


**Using yarn:**

1. **Navigate to your project directory:** Similar to npm, navigate to your project's root directory.

2. **Install Crypto Browserify:** Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn add --dev crypto-browserify
   ```
   This installs `crypto-browserify` and adds it to your `package.json` file.


### Basic Usage Example

After installation, you can use Crypto Browserify in your project. Here's a simple example demonstrating SHA-256 hashing:

1. **Create an index.js file:** Create a file named `index.js` in your project directory.

2. **Add the code:** Paste the following code into `index.js`:

   ```javascript
   const crypto = require('crypto');

   const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
   hash.update('Hello, world!');
   const digest = hash.digest('hex');
   console.log(digest);
   ```

3. **Bundle the code:** Use Browserify to bundle your code.  You might need to install browserify globally if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   npm install -g browserify
   ```

   Then, bundle your code:

   ```bash
   browserify index.js -o bundle.js
   ```
   This creates a `bundle.js` file containing your code, ready for use in a browser.

4. **Include in HTML:**  Include `bundle.js` in your HTML file using a `<script>` tag:


   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Crypto Browserify Example</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <script src="bundle.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Open the HTML file in your browser; the SHA-256 hash of "Hello, world!" will be printed to the browser's console.



### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

* **npm or yarn errors:**  Ensure you have the correct permissions to install packages. Run your terminal as an administrator or with `sudo` (on Linux/macOS).  Check your internet connection.  If you encounter specific errors, search for them online or check the npm or yarn documentation.

* **Browserify errors:** Make sure browserify is correctly installed globally (`npm list -g --depth=0` should show browserify).  If you're using a different bundler, adapt the bundling step accordingly.

* **Crypto Browserify not working:** Double-check that `crypto-browserify` is listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file.  Ensure that you're correctly requiring the `crypto` module in your JavaScript code (`const crypto = require('crypto');`). If you encounter errors during the bundling process, check the Browserify output for clues.  Verify the algorithm you are using is supported by crypto-browserify.


## API Reference

Crypto Browserify provides a largely compatible API to the Node.js `crypto` module.  However, browser limitations may influence certain functionalities.  Always consult the latest Node.js `crypto` documentation for detailed information on algorithm specifics and options.  This section provides a summary of commonly used functions.


### crypto.createHash()

Creates a hash object.  Arguments:

* `algorithm`: String specifying the hashing algorithm (e.g., 'sha256', 'sha512', 'md5').

Example:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
hash.update('some data');
const digest = hash.digest('hex'); // digest is the hexadecimal representation of the hash
```


### crypto.createHmac()

Creates an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) object.  Arguments:

* `algorithm`: String specifying the HMAC algorithm (e.g., 'sha256', 'sha512').
* `key`:  The secret key used for HMAC generation (Buffer or string).

Example:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'mysecretkey');
hmac.update('some data');
const digest = hmac.digest('hex');
```


### crypto.createCipher()

Creates a cipher object for encryption. Arguments:

* `algorithm`: String specifying the encryption algorithm (e.g., 'aes-256-cbc').
* `key`: The encryption key (Buffer).
* `iv`: The initialization vector (Buffer, required for algorithms that use it, like CBC mode).

Example:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from('mysecretkey', 'utf8'), Buffer.from('myiv', 'utf8'));
let encrypted = cipher.update('some data', 'utf8', 'hex');
encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
```


### crypto.createDecipher()

Creates a decipher object for decryption. Arguments are the same as `createCipher`.

Example:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const decipher = crypto.createDecipher('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from('mysecretkey', 'utf8'), Buffer.from('myiv', 'utf8'));
let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
```


### crypto.createSign()

Creates a digital signature object. Argument:

* `algorithm`: String specifying the signature algorithm (e.g., 'RSA-SHA256', 'DSA', 'ECDSA').

Example: (Requires a private key, which is not shown for security reasons.  Consult Node.js crypto documentation for key management.)

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const signer = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');
signer.update('some data');
const signature = signer.sign(privateKey);
```

### crypto.createVerify()

Creates a digital signature verification object. Argument:

* `algorithm`: String specifying the signature algorithm (must match the algorithm used for signing).

Example: (Requires a public key, which is not shown for security reasons.)

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const verifier = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA256');
verifier.update('some data');
const verified = verifier.verify(publicKey, signature);
```


### crypto.pbkdf2()

Performs PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) key derivation.  Arguments:

* `password`: The password (Buffer or string).
* `salt`: The salt (Buffer).
* `iterations`: Number of iterations.
* `keylen`: Length of the derived key.
* `digest`: Hashing algorithm (e.g., 'sha256', 'sha512').  (Callback-based in Node.js; asynchronous nature needs to be handled properly in a browser environment.)

Example (simplified, requires callback handling for asynchronous operation):

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest, (err, derivedKey) => { /* handle derivedKey */ });
```


### crypto.randomBytes()

Generates cryptographically secure random bytes. Argument:

* `size`: The number of bytes to generate.


### crypto.scrypt()

Performs scrypt key derivation.  Arguments are similar to `pbkdf2` but include parameters specific to the scrypt algorithm (N, r, p).


### Working with different hashing algorithms (SHA256, SHA512, etc.)

Specify the algorithm name as a string argument to `createHash()`, for instance, `'sha256'`, `'sha512'`, `'md5'` (although MD5 is cryptographically weak and should be avoided for security-sensitive applications).  Choose the algorithm appropriate for your security needs and considering performance implications.


### Working with different encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, etc.)

Specify the algorithm name as a string argument to `createCipher()` and `createDecipher()`.  AES is a common symmetric algorithm,  requiring a key and an initialization vector (IV). RSA is an asymmetric algorithm (requires separate key pairs for encryption and decryption).  Ensure compatibility with the browser's underlying crypto capabilities.


### Handling Errors and Exceptions

Errors can occur during cryptographic operations (e.g., invalid keys, incorrect parameters).  Proper error handling is crucial.  Always check for errors returned by functions (especially asynchronous ones) and handle them appropriately to prevent application crashes or security vulnerabilities.  For asynchronous operations, utilize promises or async/await to manage errors gracefully within your application.  Refer to the documentation for specific error codes and their meanings.


## Advanced Usage

### Integrating with other libraries

Crypto Browserify can be integrated with other JavaScript libraries.  For example, you might use it with a library for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or a library that facilitates secure communication using TLS/SSL.  When integrating, ensure compatibility between libraries and handle potential conflicts or inconsistencies in API design.  Careful consideration should be given to dependency management and potential security implications introduced by third-party libraries.


### Secure Key Storage and Management

**Never** store cryptographic keys directly within your client-side JavaScript code.  Doing so exposes your keys to potential attackers who could gain access to your browser's resources.  For client-side applications, explore these options (with awareness of their limitations):

* **Web Crypto API:**  Provides browser-native APIs for key generation, storage, and cryptographic operations.  However, the security and persistence characteristics vary significantly among browsers.
* **Local Storage (with caution):**  Store encrypted keys in local storage.  However, this approach is not inherently secure and requires robust encryption at rest.
* **Server-side Key Management:** The most secure approach involves storing keys on a secure server and retrieving them as needed. This requires a well-designed communication protocol to avoid exposing keys during transfer.  Use HTTPS or a similar secure protocol for communication.


### Optimizing performance

Cryptographic operations, especially those involving asymmetric cryptography, can be computationally expensive.  To optimize performance:

* **Algorithm Selection:** Choose algorithms that strike a balance between security and performance.  Symmetric algorithms like AES are generally faster than asymmetric algorithms like RSA.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous functions (Promises or async/await) for operations that could block the main thread. This prevents UI freezes and keeps the application responsive.
* **Caching:** Where appropriate, cache results of expensive computations to avoid redundant work.  Be mindful of the security implications of caching sensitive data.
* **Code Optimization:** Write efficient code and avoid unnecessary computations.  Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.


### Best Practices for Secure Code

* **Input Validation:** Always validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.  Sanitize and escape any data used in cryptographic operations.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities in your application.  Use a linter and conduct code reviews.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits to identify and address potential weaknesses.
* **Up-to-Date Dependencies:** Keep your dependencies, including Crypto Browserify and other libraries, updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* **Avoid using weak or deprecated algorithms:** Stick to modern, well-vetted algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-512, and AES-256.  Avoid using MD5 or other deprecated algorithms.


### Using Crypto Browserify in different browser environments

Crypto Browserify aims for broad browser compatibility.  However, very old or unsupported browsers might lack necessary features for some cryptographic operations.  Ensure your application gracefully handles situations where a specific operation is unavailable in a given browser. Use feature detection to check for supported algorithms or APIs before attempting to use them.


### Common Use Cases and Examples

* **Client-side encryption/decryption:** Protect sensitive data stored in the browser's local storage or transmitted over insecure connections.
* **Generating and verifying digital signatures:** Implement secure authentication schemes.
* **Creating and verifying message authentication codes (MACs):** Ensure data integrity and authenticity.
* **Password hashing:** Store passwords securely, preventing them from being stored in plain text.
* **Secure communication:** Enhance the security of web applications using Crypto Browserify in conjunction with other libraries or protocols.


### Advanced Key Derivation Functions

Crypto Browserify provides access to key derivation functions like `pbkdf2` and `scrypt`.  These functions are essential for deriving strong cryptographic keys from passwords or other less secure secrets.  They're crucial because directly using passwords as keys is insecure.  Always use a sufficient number of iterations to increase the computational cost for attackers attempting brute-force or dictionary attacks.  The choice between `pbkdf2` and `scrypt` depends on the specific security requirements and performance considerations of your application.  `scrypt` is generally considered more resistant to hardware acceleration attacks.


## Security Considerations

### Potential Vulnerabilities and Mitigation Strategies

While Crypto Browserify provides a convenient way to perform cryptographic operations in the browser, it's crucial to understand potential vulnerabilities and implement appropriate mitigation strategies.  Some key vulnerabilities and their mitigations are:

* **Improper Key Management:**  Storing keys directly in client-side code is a major vulnerability.  Always use secure key storage mechanisms (see the "Secure Key Storage and Management" section in Advanced Usage).  Implement strong key generation and rotation practices.

* **Weak Algorithms:** Using outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms significantly weakens your security.  Always use strong, well-vetted algorithms (e.g., AES-256, SHA-256, SHA-512) and avoid MD5 or other deprecated algorithms.

* **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Failing to validate user inputs can lead to injection attacks.  Sanitize and escape all user-provided data used in cryptographic operations.

* **Timing Attacks:**  Timing attacks exploit variations in execution time to infer information about cryptographic keys or data.  Use constant-time comparison functions when comparing cryptographic values to mitigate this risk.

* **Side-Channel Attacks (see next section):**  These attacks exploit unintended information leakage (e.g., power consumption, execution time).

* **Broken Cryptography:**  Incorrectly implementing cryptographic functions can lead to vulnerabilities.  Thoroughly review your code and consider using well-established libraries or seeking expert review for critical security components.


### Secure Coding Practices

Follow these secure coding practices when using Crypto Browserify:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs *before* using them in cryptographic operations.  This is essential to prevent injection attacks, where malicious data is inserted to manipulate the cryptographic process.

* **Error Handling:**  Handle exceptions and errors gracefully to prevent unexpected behavior or information leakage.  Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.

* **Secure Key Generation:** Use strong random number generators (`crypto.randomBytes()`) to generate keys.

* **Least Privilege:** Only grant the necessary permissions to the code handling cryptographic functions.

* **Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

* **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to detect potential security flaws in your code.

* **Regular Updates:** Keep your dependencies up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.


### Protecting against Side-Channel Attacks

Side-channel attacks exploit information leaked unintentionally during cryptographic operations.  Here's how to mitigate these attacks:

* **Constant-Time Comparisons:**  Avoid conditional branching based on the result of a cryptographic operation.  Use constant-time comparison functions to prevent timing attacks.

* **Careful Memory Management:**  Avoid leaking sensitive information through memory access patterns.

* **Power Analysis Countermeasures:**  (Advanced) If you're working with hardware security modules or systems where power consumption is a concern, consider techniques to mitigate power analysis attacks.

* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits to identify and address potential side-channel vulnerabilities.


### Regular Security Updates

The cryptographic landscape constantly evolves, and new vulnerabilities are discovered regularly.  To stay protected:

* **Update Dependencies:** Keep Crypto Browserify and all related dependencies updated to the latest versions.  This is critical for patching security vulnerabilities and incorporating improvements.

* **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities by monitoring security advisories from Node.js, Crypto Browserify, and other relevant projects.

* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits to assess the security posture of your application and address any newly identified vulnerabilities.  Professional security audits might be necessary for high-security applications.

Remember, security is an ongoing process.  Implementing robust security measures is essential for building secure and trustworthy applications using Crypto Browserify.


## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Errors and Solutions

This section outlines some common errors encountered when using Crypto Browserify and suggests solutions.

* **`ReferenceError: crypto is not defined`:** This error typically means that `crypto-browserify` isn't properly included in your bundle.  Double-check that you have correctly installed `crypto-browserify` (`npm install --save-dev crypto-browserify` or `yarn add --dev crypto-browserify`) and that your bundler (like Browserify) is correctly including it in your output file (`bundle.js` or similar).  Ensure the `require('crypto')` statement is present in your code.

* **Algorithm-specific errors:** If you receive errors related to specific algorithms (e.g., "Unsupported algorithm"), verify that the algorithm is supported by both Crypto Browserify and the browser you are using.  Consult the documentation for Node.js's `crypto` module and the browser's Web Crypto API to check algorithm compatibility.

* **Key-related errors:** Errors involving keys (e.g., incorrect key length, invalid key format) indicate problems with key generation, storage, or usage.  Review your key management practices.  Ensure keys are properly generated using cryptographically secure random number generators, stored securely (not directly in code), and used correctly in the cryptographic operations.  Check key lengths and formats against algorithm requirements.

* **Bundling errors:** Errors occurring during the bundling process (using Browserify or another bundler) often indicate problems with your build configuration.  Review your bundler's documentation and carefully check for errors reported during the build process.

* **Asynchronous operation errors:**  For asynchronous operations (e.g., `pbkdf2`), errors might not be immediately apparent.  Always handle promises or callbacks correctly, catching and managing errors appropriately.


### Debugging Techniques

Debugging cryptographic code requires a methodical approach:

* **Console Logging:** Strategically use `console.log()` to inspect intermediate values during the cryptographic process.  Log key parameters, inputs, and outputs to understand where the issue lies.  Avoid logging sensitive information directly.

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to debug JavaScript code. Set breakpoints, step through your code, and inspect variables to identify the source of errors.

* **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the correct functionality of your cryptographic functions.  This can help isolate and identify problems in individual components of your code.

* **Code Reviews:**  Have another developer review your code to find potential problems you might have missed.

* **Simplify:** If debugging is proving difficult, create a minimal reproducible example.  Try to isolate the problematic portion of the code to make debugging easier.
