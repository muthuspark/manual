It incorporates features like keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for screen readers.\n* **Dependency-Free:**  Remodal doesn't require any external libraries or frameworks, making integration simple and straightforward.\n* **Responsive Design:** Modals automatically adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices.\n* **Simple API:** The API is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, allowing developers to quickly create and manage modals with minimal code.\n\n\n### Getting Started: Installation and Setup\n\nRemodal can be included in your project in two ways:\n\n**1. Downloading the file:**\n\n* Download the `remodal.min.js` and `remodal.css` files from [link to download - replace with actual link].\n* Include these files in your HTML file within the `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"remodal.css\">\n<script src=\"remodal.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**2. Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network):**\n\nWhile a direct download is recommended for optimal control and offline use, you can use a CDN for quick setup.  (Note: Replace this with an actual CDN link if one exists.  Otherwise remove this section).\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"CDN_LINK_TO_CSS\">\n<script src=\"CDN_LINK_TO_JS\"></script>\n```\n\n\nAfter including the necessary files, you can then proceed to create and initialize your modals using the Remodal JavaScript API (details on the API will be covered in the subsequent sections). Remember to replace placeholder links with the actual links to the CSS and JS files.\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Creating a Modal\n\nCreating a modal involves defining the HTML structure for your modal content and then initializing it using the Remodal JavaScript API.  First, create a `<div>` element that will contain your modal's content.  This `<div>` must have a unique `id` attribute which you'll use to reference it later.  Crucially, you also need to add the class `remodal` to this div:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal1\">\n  <h2>Modal Title</h2>\n  <p>This is the content of my modal.</p>\n  <button data-remodal-action=\"close\">Close</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `data-remodal-id` attribute assigns a unique identifier to the modal. This ID is how you'll reference and control this specific modal later using JavaScript.  The button with `data-remodal-action=\"close\"` provides a simple way to close the modal.  You can add more complex buttons and actions as needed.\n\n### Opening and Closing Modals\n\nOnce your modal is defined in your HTML, you can use JavaScript to open and close it.  First, instantiate a Remodal object using the modal's `data-remodal-id`:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal(); \n```\nThis code selects the element with the id \"modal1\" and creates a Remodal instance associated with it. Note that this requires jQuery to be included in your project.  If you don't want to use jQuery, you can use plain JavaScript with a slightly modified approach (see alternative below).\n\n\nTo open the modal:\n\n```javascript\nmodal.open();\n```\n\nTo close the modal:\n\n```javascript\nmodal.close();\n```\n\n**Alternative (without jQuery):**\n\nIf you are not using jQuery, you can instantiate Remodal like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst modal = new Remodal({ target: '#modal1' });\n\nmodal.open();\nmodal.close();\n\n```\n\nThis uses the `target` option to specify the modal element's ID.\n\n\n### Passing Data to Modals\n\nYou can dynamically pass data to your modal using custom attributes within your HTML element or by using JavaScript to set the data before opening the modal. Here’s an example using custom data attributes:\n\n\n```html\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal2\" data-my-custom-data=\"Some Value\">\n  <p>This modal will display <span id=\"dynamic-content\"></span>.</p>\n  <button data-remodal-action=\"close\">Close</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  const modal2 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal2]').remodal();\n  const customData = modal2.getElement().getAttribute('data-my-custom-data');\n  $('#dynamic-content').text(customData);\n  modal2.open();\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code retrieves the `data-my-custom-data` attribute value within the JavaScript and displays it inside the modal.  Remember to adapt this based on the exact structure of your modal.\n\n### Handling Modal Events\n\nRemodal allows you to listen for and respond to various events related to the modal's lifecycle. This enables dynamic behavior based on user interactions.  Here are some example events and how to use them:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\n\nmodal.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('Modal opened!');\n});\n\nmodal.on('close', function () {\n  console.log('Modal closed!');\n});\n\nmodal.on('closed', function () {\n    console.log(\"Modal completely closed\"); //Triggered after animations\n});\n\n\nmodal.on('beforeclose', function (e) {\n    // e.preventDefault() to prevent closing\n  console.log('Modal about to close!');\n  // Add your confirmation logic here before closing.\n});\n```\n\nThese event handlers will execute the respective functions when the specified events occur. Remember to adapt the event handling to your specific needs.  Consult the full Remodal documentation for a complete list of available events.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Styling Modals with CSS\n\nRemodal provides a clean, default styling, but you can easily customize the appearance of your modals using CSS.  The main CSS class to target is `.remodal`.  You can override existing styles or add your own to achieve the desired look.  For example, to change the background color of the modal:\n\n\n```css\n.remodal {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Change to your desired color */\n}\n```\n\nYou can also target more specific elements within the modal using more detailed selectors.  Inspect your modal's HTML using your browser's developer tools to identify the appropriate selectors for the elements you want to style.  Remodal uses a number of classes for different components of the modal (e.g., `.remodal-close`, `.remodal-overlay`), which you can use for granular control over the styling.\n\n\n### Configuring Modal Options\n\nRemodal offers several options that allow you to fine-tune the modal's behavior.  These options are passed as an object to the `remodal()` constructor. For example:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal({\n  hashTracking: false, // Disable URL hash tracking\n  closeOnOutsideClick: true, // Close on outside click\n  closeOnEscape: true, // Close on Escape key press\n  animation: {\n    open: {\n      duration: 200, //Animation duration in ms\n      property: 'opacity', // Animation property\n      easing: 'linear' // Animation easing\n    },\n    close: {\n      duration: 200,\n      property: 'opacity',\n      easing: 'linear'\n    }\n  }\n\n});\n```\n\nThe above configures the modal to disable hash tracking, close when clicking outside the modal or pressing the Escape key and sets custom animations.  Consult the Remodal documentation for a complete list of available options and their usage.  Remember that the availability of certain options might depend on the library you're using.\n\n\n### Customizing Modal Content\n\nYou can dynamically change the content of a modal after it has been initialized.  This allows you to create more interactive and data-driven modals.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\nvar modalContent = modal.getElement().querySelector('.modal-content'); //Change selector as needed\nmodalContent.innerHTML = '<h1>New Content</h1><p>This is the updated content</p>';\nmodal.open();\n```\n\nThis code selects a specific element within the modal (in this case, an element with the class `modal-content`) and replaces its content with new HTML.  You can use this to update the modal with data fetched from an API or based on user input. Remember to adapt the selectors to match the structure of your modal.\n\n\n### Using Templates\n\nFor more complex or reusable modals, it's beneficial to use templates.  You can create separate HTML templates for your modals and dynamically insert them into the modal container.  For example, if you have a template:\n\n```html\n<!-- template -->\n<script type=\"text/template\" id=\"my-modal-template\">\n  <h2>{{title}}</h2>\n  <p>{{content}}</p>\n</script>\n```\n\nYou can use JavaScript to render this template:\n\n```javascript\nvar template = $('#my-modal-template').html();\nvar renderedTemplate = Mustache.render(template, { title: 'My Modal', content: 'This is the modal content' });\nvar modalContent = modal.getElement().querySelector('.modal-content');\nmodalContent.innerHTML = renderedTemplate;\n```\n\nThis example uses the Mustache templating library. However, you can employ any templating engine you prefer.  Remember that this assumes Mustache or a similar templating engine is included in your project.  Adjust the code according to the chosen templating engine's syntax.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Multiple Modals\n\nRemodal easily supports multiple modals on a single page.  Simply create multiple `<div>` elements with the `remodal` class and unique `data-remodal-id` attributes.  Each modal will be independently managed.  For example:\n\n\n```html\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal1\">...</div>\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal2\">...</div>\n```\n\nAnd to initialize and open them:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal1 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\nvar modal2 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal2]').remodal();\n\n//Open modal1\nmodal1.open();\n\n//Later, open modal2\nmodal2.open();\n```\n\nEach modal will have its own instance and will not interfere with each other.\n\n\n### Nested Modals\n\nWhile not directly supported natively, you can create the effect of nested modals by opening one modal from within another.  This involves opening a second modal from within the event handler of the first modal's `open` or other events.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal1 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\nvar modal2 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal2]').remodal();\n\nmodal1.on('opened', function() {\n  // Open modal2 after modal1 has fully opened\n  modal2.open();\n});\n```\n\nRemember to manage the closing of nested modals appropriately to avoid unexpected behavior.  You might need to implement logic to ensure the parent modal isn't closed unintentionally when the nested modal closes.\n\n\n### AJAX and Modals\n\nYou can dynamically load content into a modal using AJAX.  Fetch the content from a server, and then update the modal's content using JavaScript.  For example:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\n\n$.ajax({\n  url: '/my-ajax-endpoint',\n  success: function(data) {\n    var modalContent = modal.getElement().querySelector('.modal-content');\n    modalContent.innerHTML = data;\n    modal.open();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis will fetch data from `/my-ajax-endpoint`, insert it into your modal content area, then open the modal.  Error handling and appropriate loading indicators should be added for a robust user experience.\n\n\n### Integrating with JavaScript Frameworks\n\nRemodal is designed to be compatible with various JavaScript frameworks.  While the examples above use jQuery, you can easily adapt the code to work with other frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.  The key is to properly select and manage the DOM elements using the framework's methods.  For instance, with React, you could manage the modal's state and trigger its opening and closing via component methods. The core Remodal API will remain the same, regardless of the framework.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nFor accessibility, ensure your modals follow these guidelines:\n\n* **ARIA Attributes:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes like `aria-modal=\"true\"` on the modal container to indicate that it's a modal dialog.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Ensure users can navigate and close the modal using the keyboard (typically the Escape key and Tab key).  Remodal provides options to handle these by default, however, ensure they are appropriately configured for your project.\n* **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Use clear and descriptive labels and headings within your modal content.  Ensure that the content is semantically structured and accessible to screen readers.\n* **Focus Management:** When the modal opens, focus should automatically be placed on the first interactive element within the modal.  When the modal closes, focus should return to the element that triggered the modal's opening.  Remodal handles this in some cases, but custom implementations may be required for more complex scenarios.\n* **Sufficient Contrast:** Ensure adequate contrast between text and background colors for users with visual impairments.\n\n\nRemember that thorough testing with assistive technologies is crucial to ensure accessibility.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Remodal Constructor\n\nThe Remodal constructor creates a new modal instance.  The primary way to instantiate Remodal is by using jQuery, although a plain JavaScript version exists.  The jQuery version is shown below.\n\n**jQuery:**\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=\"my-modal\"]').remodal([options]);\n```\n\nThis selects the element with the data attribute `data-remodal-id=\"my-modal\"` and creates a Remodal instance. The optional `[options]` argument is an object containing configuration settings (see Options Reference below).\n\n**Plain JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nconst modal = new Remodal({ target: '#my-modal', options });\n```\n\nThis creates a new Remodal instance targeting the element with the ID `my-modal`, and applying the provided `options` object.\n\n\n\n### Methods: `open()`, `close()`, `destroy()`\n\n* **`open()`:** Opens the modal.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.open();\n```\n\n* **`close()`:** Closes the modal.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.close();\n```\n\n* **`destroy()`:** Completely removes the modal from the DOM and unbinds all events.  Use this method if you don't need the modal anymore.  After calling `destroy()`, the modal instance is unusable.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.destroy();\n```\n\n\n### Events: `opened()`, `closed()`, `destroyed()`\n\nRemodal triggers several custom events that you can listen for using the `.on()` method (jQuery) or the `.addEventListener()` method (plain JavaScript).  These events allow you to execute custom code at specific points in the modal's lifecycle.\n\n\n* **`opened()`:** This event is triggered *after* the modal has finished opening, including any animations.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.on('opened', function() {\n  console.log('Modal is fully open!');\n});\n```\n\n* **`closed()`:** This event is triggered *after* the modal has finished closing, including any animations.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.on('closed', function() {\n  console.log('Modal is fully closed!');\n});\n```\n\n* **`destroyed()`:** This event is triggered after the modal has been completely removed from the DOM via the `destroy()` method.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.on('destroyed', function() {\n  console.log('Modal has been destroyed!');\n});\n```\n\n**Note:**  The `beforeclose` event is also available and is triggered *before* the closing animation starts. You can use `e.preventDefault()` within this event handler to cancel the closing of the modal.\n\n\n### Options Reference\n\nThe Remodal constructor accepts an optional options object to customize its behavior.  Here are some key options (consult the full documentation for a complete list):\n\n* **`hashTracking`:** (boolean) Enables/disables URL hash tracking for the modal.  Defaults to `true`.\n* **`closeOnOutsideClick`:** (boolean) Closes the modal when clicking outside its bounds. Defaults to `true`.\n* **`closeOnEscape`:** (boolean) Closes the modal when the Escape key is pressed. Defaults to `true`.\n* **`closeOnFocuseOut`:** (boolean) Closes the modal when focus moves outside of it. Defaults to `false`.\n* **`animation`:** (object)  Allows customization of the opening and closing animations, specifying properties like `duration`, `property`, and `easing`.  See the full documentation for detailed structure.\n* **`modifier`:** (string) Allows you to append a modifier class to the modal's root element for more specific styling.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=my-modal]').remodal({\n  hashTracking: false,\n  closeOnOutsideClick: false,\n  animation: {\n    open: { duration: 300 },\n    close: { duration: 200 }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nRemember to refer to the official Remodal documentation for the most up-to-date and complete API reference, including details on all available options and their functionalities.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nHere are some common issues encountered when using Remodal and their solutions:\n\n* **Modal doesn't open:**\n    * **Problem:**  The most frequent cause is incorrect instantiation or referencing of the modal element.  Check that the `data-remodal-id` attribute matches your JavaScript code and that the selector is correctly targeting the modal element.  Ensure that Remodal's JavaScript and CSS files are correctly included in your HTML.  Also verify that there are no JavaScript errors preventing the modal from functioning.\n    * **Solution:** Double-check your HTML for typos in the `data-remodal-id`, ensure that your Javascript code uses the correct selector to find the modal and that jQuery (or a suitable alternative) is correctly included.  Use your browser's developer console to inspect for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Modal doesn't close:**\n    * **Problem:**  This could be due to `closeOnOutsideClick` or `closeOnEscape` being set to `false` in the options.  It might also be caused by an event handler preventing closure (e.g., within a `beforeclose` event).  Finally, ensure there are no conflicts with other JavaScript libraries that might interfere with the modal's closing mechanism.\n    * **Solution:**  Check your Remodal options.  If using a `beforeclose` event handler, inspect it for any calls to `e.preventDefault()`.  If you suspect a conflict, try disabling other JavaScript libraries temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n* **Styling issues:**\n    * **Problem:** CSS conflicts with your website's stylesheet can affect the modal's appearance.  Incorrectly targeted selectors or missing styles can also cause problems.\n    * **Solution:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the modal's CSS and identify any conflicting styles.  Ensure that your CSS selectors are correctly targeting the modal and its elements. Consider using the browser's developer tools to temporarily disable other stylesheets to isolate the source of styling conflicts.\n\n* **JavaScript errors:**\n    * **Problem:** Errors in your JavaScript code, especially within event handlers related to the modal, can prevent it from working correctly.\n    * **Solution:** Use your browser's developer console to identify and fix any JavaScript errors. Pay close attention to errors occurring within the context of the modal's initialization or event handling.\n\n* **Version incompatibility:**\n    * **Problem:** Using an outdated version of Remodal or conflicting versions of dependencies can lead to unexpected behavior.\n    * **Solution:** Ensure you are using a compatible and up-to-date version of Remodal and its dependencies. Check the official Remodal documentation for compatibility information.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) extensively.  The console will show JavaScript errors and warnings. The network tab can help identify issues with loading resources, and the elements tab allows for inspection of the HTML structure and CSS styles applied to the modal.\n\n* **Simplify:** Create a minimal, reproducible example.  Isolate the problem by creating a simplified HTML page with only the necessary code for the modal and related JavaScript. This helps to eliminate potential conflicts with other parts of your application.\n\n* **Console Logging:** Use `console.log()` statements strategically in your JavaScript code to track the values of variables and the flow of execution. This can help pinpoint where the problem is occurring.  For example, log messages before and after the modal is opened and closed, or when events are triggered.\n\n* **Step-by-Step Debugging:** Use your browser's debugger to step through the code line by line, examining variable values and the call stack at each step. This provides a detailed view of the execution flow and can highlight where things are going wrong.\n\n* **Check the Documentation:** Carefully review the Remodal documentation for proper usage, options, and known issues.  The documentation often contains valuable information that can help resolve many common problems.\n\n* **Search Online:**  Search for your specific error message or problem description on sites like Stack Overflow.  Someone may have already encountered and solved the same issue.\n\n\nRemember to always thoroughly test your modal implementation across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple Modal Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic modal with a title, some content, and a close button.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Remodal Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"remodal.css\">  <!-- Path to your remodal.css -->\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"> <!--Optional custom styles -->\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <button id=\"openModal\">Open Modal</button>\n\n  <div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"simpleModal\">\n    <button data-remodal-action=\"close\" class=\"remodal-close\"></button>\n    <h2>Simple Modal</h2>\n    <p>This is a simple modal example.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script> <!-- Or your preferred jQuery CDN -->\n  <script src=\"remodal.min.js\"></script> <!-- Path to your remodal.min.js -->\n  <script>\n    $('#openModal').click(function() {\n      $('#simpleModal').remodal().open();\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"remodal.css\"` and `\"remodal.min.js\"` with the actual paths to your Remodal files.  This example uses jQuery, ensure it is included correctly.  `style.css` is optional for custom styling.\n\n### Complex Modal Example with AJAX\n\nThis example shows a modal that loads content dynamically using AJAX.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Remodal AJAX Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"remodal.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <button id=\"openModalAjax\">Open AJAX Modal</button>\n  <div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"ajaxModal\">\n    <button data-remodal-action=\"close\" class=\"remodal-close\"></button>\n    <div id=\"ajaxContent\">Loading...</div>\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"remodal.min.js\"></script>\n  <script>\n    $('#openModalAjax').click(function() {\n      let modal = $('#ajaxModal').remodal();\n      $.ajax({\n        url: '/data.json', // Replace with your AJAX endpoint\n        success: function(data) {\n          $('#ajaxContent').html(data.content); // Adjust selector as needed\n          modal.open();\n        },\n        error: function(error) {\n          $('#ajaxContent').html('Error loading content.');\n          modal.open();\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis assumes you have a `/data.json` endpoint returning JSON with a `content` property.  Handle errors appropriately in a production environment.\n\n### Example using a JavaScript Framework (React)\n\nThis example provides a basic structure.  You'll need to adapt it to your specific React setup and component structure.\n\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport $ from 'jquery'; //You'll need to include jQuery for Remodal in React\nimport 'remodal/dist/remodal.css';\nimport 'remodal/dist/remodal-default-theme.css'; //or a theme of your choice\nimport './remodal.min.js'; //Remember to include this appropriately\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);\n  const modalRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (modalRef.current) {\n       $(modalRef.current).remodal();\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  const openModal = () => {\n    setIsOpen(true);\n    $(modalRef.current).remodal().open();\n  };\n\n  const closeModal = () => {\n    setIsOpen(false);\n    $(modalRef.current).remodal().close();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={openModal}>Open Modal</button>\n      <div className=\"remodal\" ref={modalRef} data-remodal-id=\"my-react-modal\">\n        <button className=\"remodal-close\" data-remodal-action=\"close\" onClick={closeModal}></button>\n        <h2>React Modal</h2>\n        <p>This is a modal from a React component.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nThis requires setting up your React environment correctly, including jQuery and Remodal.  This is a skeletal example; adapt it to your complete application's structure and needs.  Error handling and more advanced features would need to be added for a production-ready component.  Remember to adjust paths to CSS and JS files as needed.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Introduction\n\n### What is Remodal?\n\nRemodal is a lightweight, dependency-free, and highly customizable modal window plugin for JavaScript.

Downloading the file:**\n\n* Download the `remodal.min.js` and `remodal.css` files from [link to download - replace with actual link].\n* Include these files in your HTML file within the `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"remodal.css\">\n<script src=\"remodal.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**2. Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network):**\n\nWhile a direct download is recommended for optimal control and offline use, you can use a CDN for quick setup.  (Note: Replace this with an actual CDN link if one exists.  Otherwise remove this section).\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"CDN_LINK_TO_CSS\">\n<script src=\"CDN_LINK_TO_JS\"></script>\n```\n\n\nAfter including the necessary files, you can then proceed to create and initialize your modals using the Remodal JavaScript API (details on the API will be covered in the subsequent sections). Remember to replace placeholder links with the actual links to the CSS and JS files.\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Creating a Modal\n\nCreating a modal involves defining the HTML structure for your modal content and then initializing it using the Remodal JavaScript API.  First, create a `<div>` element that will contain your modal's content.  This `<div>` must have a unique `id` attribute which you'll use to reference it later.  Crucially, you also need to add the class `remodal` to this div:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal1\">\n  <h2>Modal Title</h2>\n  <p>This is the content of my modal.</p>\n  <button data-remodal-action=\"close\">Close</button>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `data-remodal-id` attribute assigns a unique identifier to the modal. This ID is how you'll reference and control this specific modal later using JavaScript.  The button with `data-remodal-action=\"close\"` provides a simple way to close the modal.  You can add more complex buttons and actions as needed.\n\n### Opening and Closing Modals\n\nOnce your modal is defined in your HTML, you can use JavaScript to open and close it.  First, instantiate a Remodal object using the modal's `data-remodal-id`:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal(); \n```\nThis code selects the element with the id \"modal1\" and creates a Remodal instance associated with it. Note that this requires jQuery to be included in your project.  If you don't want to use jQuery, you can use plain JavaScript with a slightly modified approach (see alternative below).\n\n\nTo open the modal:\n\n```javascript\nmodal.open();\n```\n\nTo close the modal:\n\n```javascript\nmodal.close();\n```\n\n**Alternative (without jQuery):**\n\nIf you are not using jQuery, you can instantiate Remodal like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst modal = new Remodal({ target: '#modal1' });\n\nmodal.open();\nmodal.close();\n\n```\n\nThis uses the `target` option to specify the modal element's ID.\n\n\n### Passing Data to Modals\n\nYou can dynamically pass data to your modal using custom attributes within your HTML element or by using JavaScript to set the data before opening the modal. Here’s an example using custom data attributes:\n\n\n```html\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal2\" data-my-custom-data=\"Some Value\">\n  <p>This modal will display <span id=\"dynamic-content\"></span>.</p>\n  <button data-remodal-action=\"close\">Close</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  const modal2 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal2]').remodal();\n  const customData = modal2.getElement().getAttribute('data-my-custom-data');\n  $('#dynamic-content').text(customData);\n  modal2.open();\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code retrieves the `data-my-custom-data` attribute value within the JavaScript and displays it inside the modal.  Remember to adapt this based on the exact structure of your modal.\n\n### Handling Modal Events\n\nRemodal allows you to listen for and respond to various events related to the modal's lifecycle. This enables dynamic behavior based on user interactions.  Here are some example events and how to use them:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\n\nmodal.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('Modal opened!');\n});\n\nmodal.on('close', function () {\n  console.log('Modal closed!');\n});\n\nmodal.on('closed', function () {\n    console.log(\"Modal completely closed\"); //Triggered after animations\n});\n\n\nmodal.on('beforeclose', function (e) {\n    // e.preventDefault() to prevent closing\n  console.log('Modal about to close!');\n  // Add your confirmation logic here before closing.\n});\n```\n\nThese event handlers will execute the respective functions when the specified events occur. Remember to adapt the event handling to your specific needs.  Consult the full Remodal documentation for a complete list of available events.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Styling Modals with CSS\n\nRemodal provides a clean, default styling, but you can easily customize the appearance of your modals using CSS.  The main CSS class to target is `.remodal`.  You can override existing styles or add your own to achieve the desired look.  For example, to change the background color of the modal:\n\n\n```css\n.remodal {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Change to your desired color */\n}\n```\n\nYou can also target more specific elements within the modal using more detailed selectors.  Inspect your modal's HTML using your browser's developer tools to identify the appropriate selectors for the elements you want to style.  Remodal uses a number of classes for different components of the modal (e.g., `.remodal-close`, `.remodal-overlay`), which you can use for granular control over the styling.\n\n\n### Configuring Modal Options\n\nRemodal offers several options that allow you to fine-tune the modal's behavior.  These options are passed as an object to the `remodal()` constructor. For example:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal({\n  hashTracking: false, // Disable URL hash tracking\n  closeOnOutsideClick: true, // Close on outside click\n  closeOnEscape: true, // Close on Escape key press\n  animation: {\n    open: {\n      duration: 200, //Animation duration in ms\n      property: 'opacity', // Animation property\n      easing: 'linear' // Animation easing\n    },\n    close: {\n      duration: 200,\n      property: 'opacity',\n      easing: 'linear'\n    }\n  }\n\n});\n```\n\nThe above configures the modal to disable hash tracking, close when clicking outside the modal or pressing the Escape key and sets custom animations.  Consult the Remodal documentation for a complete list of available options and their usage.  Remember that the availability of certain options might depend on the library you're using.\n\n\n### Customizing Modal Content\n\nYou can dynamically change the content of a modal after it has been initialized.  This allows you to create more interactive and data-driven modals.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\nvar modalContent = modal.getElement().querySelector('.modal-content'); //Change selector as needed\nmodalContent.innerHTML = '<h1>New Content</h1><p>This is the updated content</p>';\nmodal.open();\n```\n\nThis code selects a specific element within the modal (in this case, an element with the class `modal-content`) and replaces its content with new HTML.  You can use this to update the modal with data fetched from an API or based on user input. Remember to adapt the selectors to match the structure of your modal.\n\n\n### Using Templates\n\nFor more complex or reusable modals, it's beneficial to use templates.  You can create separate HTML templates for your modals and dynamically insert them into the modal container.  For example, if you have a template:\n\n```html\n<!-- template -->\n<script type=\"text/template\" id=\"my-modal-template\">\n  <h2>{{title}}</h2>\n  <p>{{content}}</p>\n</script>\n```\n\nYou can use JavaScript to render this template:\n\n```javascript\nvar template = $('#my-modal-template').html();\nvar renderedTemplate = Mustache.render(template, { title: 'My Modal', content: 'This is the modal content' });\nvar modalContent = modal.getElement().querySelector('.modal-content');\nmodalContent.innerHTML = renderedTemplate;\n```\n\nThis example uses the Mustache templating library. However, you can employ any templating engine you prefer.  Remember that this assumes Mustache or a similar templating engine is included in your project.  Adjust the code according to the chosen templating engine's syntax.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Multiple Modals\n\nRemodal easily supports multiple modals on a single page.  Simply create multiple `<div>` elements with the `remodal` class and unique `data-remodal-id` attributes.  Each modal will be independently managed.  For example:\n\n\n```html\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal1\">...</div>\n<div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"modal2\">...</div>\n```\n\nAnd to initialize and open them:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal1 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\nvar modal2 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal2]').remodal();\n\n//Open modal1\nmodal1.open();\n\n//Later, open modal2\nmodal2.open();\n```\n\nEach modal will have its own instance and will not interfere with each other.\n\n\n### Nested Modals\n\nWhile not directly supported natively, you can create the effect of nested modals by opening one modal from within another.  This involves opening a second modal from within the event handler of the first modal's `open` or other events.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal1 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\nvar modal2 = $('[data-remodal-id=modal2]').remodal();\n\nmodal1.on('opened', function() {\n  // Open modal2 after modal1 has fully opened\n  modal2.open();\n});\n```\n\nRemember to manage the closing of nested modals appropriately to avoid unexpected behavior.  You might need to implement logic to ensure the parent modal isn't closed unintentionally when the nested modal closes.\n\n\n### AJAX and Modals\n\nYou can dynamically load content into a modal using AJAX.  Fetch the content from a server, and then update the modal's content using JavaScript.  For example:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=modal1]').remodal();\n\n$.ajax({\n  url: '/my-ajax-endpoint',\n  success: function(data) {\n    var modalContent = modal.getElement().querySelector('.modal-content');\n    modalContent.innerHTML = data;\n    modal.open();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis will fetch data from `/my-ajax-endpoint`, insert it into your modal content area, then open the modal.  Error handling and appropriate loading indicators should be added for a robust user experience.\n\n\n### Integrating with JavaScript Frameworks\n\nRemodal is designed to be compatible with various JavaScript frameworks.  While the examples above use jQuery, you can easily adapt the code to work with other frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.  The key is to properly select and manage the DOM elements using the framework's methods.  For instance, with React, you could manage the modal's state and trigger its opening and closing via component methods. The core Remodal API will remain the same, regardless of the framework.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nFor accessibility, ensure your modals follow these guidelines:\n\n* **ARIA Attributes:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes like `aria-modal=\"true\"` on the modal container to indicate that it's a modal dialog.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Ensure users can navigate and close the modal using the keyboard (typically the Escape key and Tab key).  Remodal provides options to handle these by default, however, ensure they are appropriately configured for your project.\n* **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Use clear and descriptive labels and headings within your modal content.  Ensure that the content is semantically structured and accessible to screen readers.\n* **Focus Management:** When the modal opens, focus should automatically be placed on the first interactive element within the modal.  When the modal closes, focus should return to the element that triggered the modal's opening.  Remodal handles this in some cases, but custom implementations may be required for more complex scenarios.\n* **Sufficient Contrast:** Ensure adequate contrast between text and background colors for users with visual impairments.\n\n\nRemember that thorough testing with assistive technologies is crucial to ensure accessibility.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Remodal Constructor\n\nThe Remodal constructor creates a new modal instance.  The primary way to instantiate Remodal is by using jQuery, although a plain JavaScript version exists.  The jQuery version is shown below.\n\n**jQuery:**\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=\"my-modal\"]').remodal([options]);\n```\n\nThis selects the element with the data attribute `data-remodal-id=\"my-modal\"` and creates a Remodal instance. The optional `[options]` argument is an object containing configuration settings (see Options Reference below).\n\n**Plain JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nconst modal = new Remodal({ target: '#my-modal', options });\n```\n\nThis creates a new Remodal instance targeting the element with the ID `my-modal`, and applying the provided `options` object.\n\n\n\n### Methods: `open()`, `close()`, `destroy()`\n\n* **`open()`:** Opens the modal.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.open();\n```\n\n* **`close()`:** Closes the modal.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.close();\n```\n\n* **`destroy()`:** Completely removes the modal from the DOM and unbinds all events.  Use this method if you don't need the modal anymore.  After calling `destroy()`, the modal instance is unusable.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.destroy();\n```\n\n\n### Events: `opened()`, `closed()`, `destroyed()`\n\nRemodal triggers several custom events that you can listen for using the `.on()` method (jQuery) or the `.addEventListener()` method (plain JavaScript).  These events allow you to execute custom code at specific points in the modal's lifecycle.\n\n\n* **`opened()`:** This event is triggered *after* the modal has finished opening, including any animations.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.on('opened', function() {\n  console.log('Modal is fully open!');\n});\n```\n\n* **`closed()`:** This event is triggered *after* the modal has finished closing, including any animations.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.on('closed', function() {\n  console.log('Modal is fully closed!');\n});\n```\n\n* **`destroyed()`:** This event is triggered after the modal has been completely removed from the DOM via the `destroy()` method.\n\n```javascript\nmodal.on('destroyed', function() {\n  console.log('Modal has been destroyed!');\n});\n```\n\n**Note:**  The `beforeclose` event is also available and is triggered *before* the closing animation starts. You can use `e.preventDefault()` within this event handler to cancel the closing of the modal.\n\n\n### Options Reference\n\nThe Remodal constructor accepts an optional options object to customize its behavior.  Here are some key options (consult the full documentation for a complete list):\n\n* **`hashTracking`:** (boolean) Enables/disables URL hash tracking for the modal.  Defaults to `true`.\n* **`closeOnOutsideClick`:** (boolean) Closes the modal when clicking outside its bounds. Defaults to `true`.\n* **`closeOnEscape`:** (boolean) Closes the modal when the Escape key is pressed. Defaults to `true`.\n* **`closeOnFocuseOut`:** (boolean) Closes the modal when focus moves outside of it. Defaults to `false`.\n* **`animation`:** (object)  Allows customization of the opening and closing animations, specifying properties like `duration`, `property`, and `easing`.  See the full documentation for detailed structure.\n* **`modifier`:** (string) Allows you to append a modifier class to the modal's root element for more specific styling.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nvar modal = $('[data-remodal-id=my-modal]').remodal({\n  hashTracking: false,\n  closeOnOutsideClick: false,\n  animation: {\n    open: { duration: 300 },\n    close: { duration: 200 }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nRemember to refer to the official Remodal documentation for the most up-to-date and complete API reference, including details on all available options and their functionalities.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nHere are some common issues encountered when using Remodal and their solutions:\n\n* **Modal doesn't open:**\n    * **Problem:**  The most frequent cause is incorrect instantiation or referencing of the modal element.  Check that the `data-remodal-id` attribute matches your JavaScript code and that the selector is correctly targeting the modal element.  Ensure that Remodal's JavaScript and CSS files are correctly included in your HTML.  Also verify that there are no JavaScript errors preventing the modal from functioning.\n    * **Solution:** Double-check your HTML for typos in the `data-remodal-id`, ensure that your Javascript code uses the correct selector to find the modal and that jQuery (or a suitable alternative) is correctly included.  Use your browser's developer console to inspect for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Modal doesn't close:**\n    * **Problem:**  This could be due to `closeOnOutsideClick` or `closeOnEscape` being set to `false` in the options.  It might also be caused by an event handler preventing closure (e.g., within a `beforeclose` event).  Finally, ensure there are no conflicts with other JavaScript libraries that might interfere with the modal's closing mechanism.\n    * **Solution:**  Check your Remodal options.  If using a `beforeclose` event handler, inspect it for any calls to `e.preventDefault()`.  If you suspect a conflict, try disabling other JavaScript libraries temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n* **Styling issues:**\n    * **Problem:** CSS conflicts with your website's stylesheet can affect the modal's appearance.  Incorrectly targeted selectors or missing styles can also cause problems.\n    * **Solution:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the modal's CSS and identify any conflicting styles.  Ensure that your CSS selectors are correctly targeting the modal and its elements. Consider using the browser's developer tools to temporarily disable other stylesheets to isolate the source of styling conflicts.\n\n* **JavaScript errors:**\n    * **Problem:** Errors in your JavaScript code, especially within event handlers related to the modal, can prevent it from working correctly.\n    * **Solution:** Use your browser's developer console to identify and fix any JavaScript errors. Pay close attention to errors occurring within the context of the modal's initialization or event handling.\n\n* **Version incompatibility:**\n    * **Problem:** Using an outdated version of Remodal or conflicting versions of dependencies can lead to unexpected behavior.\n    * **Solution:** Ensure you are using a compatible and up-to-date version of Remodal and its dependencies. Check the official Remodal documentation for compatibility information.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) extensively.  The console will show JavaScript errors and warnings. The network tab can help identify issues with loading resources, and the elements tab allows for inspection of the HTML structure and CSS styles applied to the modal.\n\n* **Simplify:** Create a minimal, reproducible example.  Isolate the problem by creating a simplified HTML page with only the necessary code for the modal and related JavaScript. This helps to eliminate potential conflicts with other parts of your application.\n\n* **Console Logging:** Use `console.log()` statements strategically in your JavaScript code to track the values of variables and the flow of execution. This can help pinpoint where the problem is occurring.  For example, log messages before and after the modal is opened and closed, or when events are triggered.\n\n* **Step-by-Step Debugging:** Use your browser's debugger to step through the code line by line, examining variable values and the call stack at each step. This provides a detailed view of the execution flow and can highlight where things are going wrong.\n\n* **Check the Documentation:** Carefully review the Remodal documentation for proper usage, options, and known issues.  The documentation often contains valuable information that can help resolve many common problems.\n\n* **Search Online:**  Search for your specific error message or problem description on sites like Stack Overflow.  Someone may have already encountered and solved the same issue.\n\n\nRemember to always thoroughly test your modal implementation across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple Modal Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic modal with a title, some content, and a close button.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Remodal Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"remodal.css\">  <!-- Path to your remodal.css -->\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"> <!--Optional custom styles -->\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <button id=\"openModal\">Open Modal</button>\n\n  <div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"simpleModal\">\n    <button data-remodal-action=\"close\" class=\"remodal-close\"></button>\n    <h2>Simple Modal</h2>\n    <p>This is a simple modal example.</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script> <!-- Or your preferred jQuery CDN -->\n  <script src=\"remodal.min.js\"></script> <!-- Path to your remodal.min.js -->\n  <script>\n    $('#openModal').click(function() {\n      $('#simpleModal').remodal().open();\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"remodal.css\"` and `\"remodal.min.js\"` with the actual paths to your Remodal files.  This example uses jQuery, ensure it is included correctly.  `style.css` is optional for custom styling.\n\n### Complex Modal Example with AJAX\n\nThis example shows a modal that loads content dynamically using AJAX.\n\n**HTML (`index.html`):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Remodal AJAX Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"remodal.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <button id=\"openModalAjax\">Open AJAX Modal</button>\n  <div class=\"remodal\" data-remodal-id=\"ajaxModal\">\n    <button data-remodal-action=\"close\" class=\"remodal-close\"></button>\n    <div id=\"ajaxContent\">Loading...</div>\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"remodal.min.js\"></script>\n  <script>\n    $('#openModalAjax').click(function() {\n      let modal = $('#ajaxModal').remodal();\n      $.ajax({\n        url: '/data.json', // Replace with your AJAX endpoint\n        success: function(data) {\n          $('#ajaxContent').html(data.content); // Adjust selector as needed\n          modal.open();\n        },\n        error: function(error) {\n          $('#ajaxContent').html('Error loading content.');\n          modal.open();\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis assumes you have a `/data.json` endpoint returning JSON with a `content` property.  Handle errors appropriately in a production environment.\n\n### Example using a JavaScript Framework (React)\n\nThis example provides a basic structure.  You'll need to adapt it to your specific React setup and component structure.\n\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport $ from 'jquery'; //You'll need to include jQuery for Remodal in React\nimport 'remodal/dist/remodal.css';\nimport 'remodal/dist/remodal-default-theme.css'; //or a theme of your choice\nimport './remodal.min.js'; //Remember to include this appropriately\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);\n  const modalRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (modalRef.current) {\n       $(modalRef.current).remodal();\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  const openModal = () => {\n    setIsOpen(true);\n    $(modalRef.current).remodal().open();\n  };\n\n  const closeModal = () => {\n    setIsOpen(false);\n    $(modalRef.current).remodal().close();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={openModal}>Open Modal</button>\n      <div className=\"remodal\" ref={modalRef} data-remodal-id=\"my-react-modal\">\n        <button className=\"remodal-close\" data-remodal-action=\"close\" onClick={closeModal}></button>\n        <h2>React Modal</h2>\n        <p>This is a modal from a React component.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nThis requires setting up your React environment correctly, including jQuery and Remodal.  This is a skeletal example; adapt it to your complete application's structure and needs.  Error handling and more advanced features would need to be added for a production-ready component.  Remember to adjust paths to CSS and JS files as needed.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
