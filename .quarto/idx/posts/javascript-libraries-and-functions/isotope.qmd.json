Think of it as a sophisticated, responsive grid system that allows for flexible sorting, filtering, and rearranging of content on the fly, without the need for page reloads.  Isotope uses a masonry-style layout by default, offering a visually appealing and efficient way to display items of varying sizes, but it supports numerous layout modes.  It's ideal for applications such as image galleries, product catalogs, portfolio displays, and any dynamic content arrangement where responsiveness and user interaction are key.\n\n### Why use Isotope?\n\n* **Dynamic Layout:**  Easily rearrange items in response to user actions or changes in content, without complex manual DOM manipulation.\n\n* **Responsive Design:**  Automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal presentation across various devices.\n\n* **Multiple Layout Modes:**  Choose from several pre-defined layout modes (masonry, fitRows, cellsByRow, cellsByColumn, straightDown, etc.) or create custom layouts to suit your specific needs.\n\n* **Filtering and Sorting:**  Quickly filter and sort items based on defined criteria, providing a more intuitive user experience.\n\n* **Easy Integration:**  Integrates seamlessly with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.\n\n* **Well-Documented and Supported:**  Extensive documentation and a helpful community make it easy to learn and use.\n\n* **Performance Optimized:**  Designed for efficiency, handling large numbers of items without significant performance degradation.\n\n\n### Setting up Isotope: Including the Library\n\nThere are several ways to include the Isotope library in your project:\n\n**1. Download and Include:**\n\nDownload the Isotope JavaScript file (e.g., `isotope.pkgd.min.js`) from the official Isotope website and include it in your HTML file within `<script>` tags, placing it before your custom JavaScript code:\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Isotope Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\">  </head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"isotope-container\">\n    <!-- Your isotope items will go here -->\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"js/isotope.pkgd.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"js/script.js\"></script> </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**2. Using a CDN:**  You can also use a CDN to include Isotope, eliminating the need to download the file.  Several CDNs host Isotope; check the official Isotope website for the most up-to-date links.  This method is generally preferred for ease of use and consistent access.  For example, using jsDelivr:\n\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/isotope-layout@3/dist/isotope.pkgd.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**3. Using a Package Manager (npm or yarn):**\n\nIf you're using a package manager like npm or yarn, you can install Isotope as a dependency:\n\n```bash\nnpm install isotope-layout\n# or\nyarn add isotope-layout\n```\n\nThen, import it into your JavaScript file using a module bundler such as Webpack or Parcel.  (Specific import syntax will depend on your bundler).\n\n\n**Note:**  Isotope relies on jQuery. Ensure that jQuery is included *before* the Isotope library in your HTML file. You can include it via a CDN or download it locally.\n\n\n### Basic Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple Isotope setup with a masonry layout:\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Isotope Basic Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/isotope-layout@3/dist/isotope.min.css\">\n  <style>\n    #isotope-container {\n      width: 800px; /* Adjust as needed */\n    }\n    .item {\n      width: 200px;\n      height: 150px;\n      background-color: #eee;\n      margin: 10px;\n      float: left; /* Needed for initial display */\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div id=\"isotope-container\">\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 1</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 2</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 3</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 4</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 5</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 6</div>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/isotope-layout@3/dist/isotope.pkgd.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(document).ready(function() {\n    $('#isotope-container').isotope({\n      itemSelector: '.item',\n      layoutMode: 'masonry'\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code creates a container (`#isotope-container`) with several items. The JavaScript initializes Isotope, specifying the item selector (`.item`) and the layout mode (`masonry`).  This simple example showcases the core functionality. The subsequent sections of this manual will delve into more advanced features and options.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Items and Containers\n\nIsotope operates on two fundamental elements: **items** and the **container**.\n\n* **Container:** This is the HTML element that holds all the items you want Isotope to manage.  It's typically a `<div>` or similar element.  You specify this container element when initializing Isotope.\n\n* **Items:** These are the individual elements within the container that Isotope arranges and manipulates.  They can be any type of HTML element (e.g., `<div>`, `<img>`, `<li>`), and they're usually visually distinct elements like images, product listings, or blog posts.  Isotope identifies these items based on the `itemSelector` option (explained below).\n\nIt's crucial that your items are already present in the DOM within the container *before* you initialize Isotope.\n\n### Item Selectors\n\nThe `itemSelector` option is vital for Isotope's functionality.  It tells Isotope which elements within the container should be treated as individual items. This is a CSS selector string (similar to what you'd use in jQuery or other CSS-related JavaScript libraries).\n\nFor example:\n\n* `'.item'` selects all elements with the class `item`.\n* `'li'` selects all list items within the container.\n* `'div.product'` selects all `<div>` elements with the class `product`.\n\nChoosing an appropriate and efficient selector is crucial for Isotope's performance, particularly with a large number of items.  Avoid overly general selectors that might unintentionally select unwanted elements.\n\n### Layout Modes\n\nIsotope offers various layout modes that determine how items are arranged within the container. The most common is `masonry`, but other options provide different visual effects and organizational strategies.  Here are some key layout modes:\n\n* **`masonry`:** A classic staggered layout where items stack in a visually appealing, irregular grid.  This is often the default and best suited for items of varying heights.\n\n* **`fitRows`:** Items are placed from left to right, filling each row to the fullest extent before moving to the next row.  This is ideal for items with consistent heights.\n\n* **`fitColumns`:**  The vertical equivalent of `fitRows`. Items are placed from top to bottom, filling each column to the fullest extent before moving to the next column. Ideal for items of consistent widths.\n\n\n* **`cellsByRow`:** Creates a regular grid with cells of a specified size (using the `cells` option). Items fill the grid cells sequentially.\n\n* **`cellsByColumn`:** Similar to `cellsByRow`, but fills the grid cells column by column.\n\n\n* **`straightDown`:** Items are stacked vertically, one on top of another. This is effectively a single-column layout.\n\n\n\nYou specify the layout mode using the `layoutMode` option when initializing Isotope.  For custom layout modes, you can extend Isotope's functionality by creating your own layout class.  Refer to the advanced sections of this manual and the Isotope documentation for more details.\n\n### Filtering\n\nIsotope's filtering capabilities allow you to dynamically show or hide items based on specific criteria. You can filter items based on attributes, classes, or any other criteria that you define.\n\nFiltering is typically achieved using the `filter()` method.  The argument to `filter()` is a selector string. This string acts as a filter determining which elements are kept visible.  For example:\n\n* `'.category-a'` would display only items with the class `category-a`.\n* `'[data-price=\"low\"]'` would display items with the data attribute `data-price` set to \"low\".\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({ /* ... */ });\n$('#filter-buttons button').on('click', function() {\n  var filterValue = $(this).attr('data-filter');\n  $('#isotope-container').isotope({ filter: filterValue });\n});\n```\n\nThis code adds event listeners to filter buttons. Each button has a `data-filter` attribute specifying the filter selector.  Clicking a button updates the Isotope filter.\n\n\n### Sorting\n\nSorting in Isotope allows you to rearrange the order of items within the container based on defined criteria.  Similar to filtering, sorting uses the `sortItems()` method and relies on a `sortBy` option when initializing or using `isotope()`\n\n\nThe `sortBy` option accepts a string that specifies the sorting criteria. This is typically a data attribute on the items to sort by.  Isotope can sort items in ascending or descending order based on various criteria such as:\n\n* **Numerical values:**  Use data attributes containing numbers (e.g., `data-sort-value=\"10\"`).\n* **Strings:** Use data attributes containing strings.  String comparisons will be alphabetic.\n* **Dates:** Use data attributes representing dates.  You'll need to convert them to Date objects for correct sorting (Isotope doesn't handle date string comparisons directly).\n\n\nExample (sorting by numerical value):\n\n```javascript\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({\n    itemSelector: '.item',\n    layoutMode: 'masonry',\n    getSortData: {\n        value: '[data-value]' // extract data-value attribute from elements\n    }\n});\n\n\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({ sortBy: 'value' }); // Sort in ascending order by default\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({ sortBy: 'value', sortAscending: false }); // Sort in descending order\n```\n\n\nRemember to include the `getSortData` option with  `sortBy` to tell Isotope how to extract the sorting data from your items. The key (`value` in the example) should match the name used in `sortBy`.  For more complex sorting scenarios, you can provide a custom function in `getSortData`.  Consult the Isotope documentation for details on custom sorting.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Layout Modes\n\nIsotope provides a variety of pre-built layout modes to arrange items within a container.  You select a layout mode using the `layoutMode` option when initializing Isotope.  Each mode offers a different visual effect and is better suited for specific use cases.\n\n### Masonry\n\nThe `masonry` layout mode is Isotope's most popular and widely used layout. It creates a visually appealing, staggered grid, similar to a brick wall. Items are placed in rows, with varying heights allowed, creating a dynamic and organic look.  Items are positioned as high as possible without overlapping.  This is often the ideal choice for showcasing images or items of diverse heights.\n\n\n### Fit Rows\n\nThe `fitRows` layout mode places items from left to right, filling each row completely before moving to the next. This layout is best suited for items of similar height.  It creates a neat, grid-like structure, often preferred for consistent displays.  Items will not overlap; if an item is too wide for a row, it will start a new row.\n\n\n### Cells by Columns\n\nThe `cellsByColumn` layout mode arranges items into a grid based on specified cell widths and heights. Items are placed in cells, filling columns from top to bottom.  This requires you to specify the `cells` option (an array of width and height) when initializing Isotope. It's good for creating clean, evenly spaced grids with fixed cell dimensions.\n\n\n\n### Cells by Row\n\nThe `cellsByRow` layout mode is analogous to `cellsByColumn`, but instead of filling columns from top to bottom, it fills rows from left to right.  Similar to `cellsByColumn`, it requires the `cells` option for specifying the grid's cell dimensions.  It's ideal for situations where a row-major ordering is preferred for the grid.\n\n\n### Horizontal\n\nThe `horizontal` layout mode arranges items horizontally, in a single row. This is a simple linear layout, suitable when you only want items displayed in a sequence along a single axis.\n\n\n### Vertical\n\nThe `vertical` layout mode arranges items vertically, stacked one on top of another. It creates a single-column layout, suitable when a vertical list display is desired.\n\n\n### Justified\n\nThe `justified` layout mode (often requiring a plugin or additional setup) aims to evenly distribute items within rows, attempting to make each row the same height. The implementation details can vary depending on the specific Isotope extension or library used. It's ideal for creating visually balanced rows, but can sometimes lead to uneven spacing between items.\n\n\n### Packery\n\nPackery is not a built-in layout mode of Isotope itself, but rather a separate library often used in conjunction with it. Packery provides a layout that's similar to masonry but offers more advanced features and handling of complex item sizes and shapes. It's particularly helpful when dealing with items that may have unusual aspect ratios.  It would need to be integrated separately.\n\n\n### Column\n\nA `column` layout mode (often implemented as a custom or plugin extension) divides the container into a specified number of columns and distributes items evenly among them. It creates a grid-like structure with equal column widths.  This mode may require additional setup or a plugin.\n\n\n### Staggered\n\nWhile \"staggered\" might seem synonymous with \"masonry,\" the term generally implies a less rigid, more freely positioned arrangement of items, where precise row alignment isn't strictly enforced. In Isotope, this effect is typically achieved using the `masonry` layout mode with variations in item height.\n\n\n### Custom Layout Modes\n\nIsotope's flexibility extends to creating completely custom layout modes.  This involves writing a JavaScript class that extends Isotope's `LayoutMode` class and implements its methods.  Custom layout modes allow you to design entirely new arrangements based on your application's specific needs.  The Isotope documentation provides detailed information on extending Isotope and developing custom layouts.  This is an advanced topic requiring a solid understanding of JavaScript and Isotope's internal workings.\n\n\nRemember to consult the Isotope documentation for the most up-to-date information on available layout modes, their options, and any required plugins or dependencies.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Filtering Items\n\nIsotope's filtering capabilities allow you to dynamically show and hide items within your layout based on various criteria. This is a powerful tool for creating interactive and responsive interfaces.\n\n### Basic Filtering\n\nThe simplest form of filtering uses a CSS selector string passed to the `isotope().filter()` method. This selector determines which items remain visible.\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize Isotope\nvar $grid = $('#grid').isotope({\n  // options...\n});\n\n// Filter items with class 'category-a'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a' });\n\n// Filter items with attribute data-price=\"low\"\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-price=\"low\"]' });\n```\n\nThe filter string works exactly like a CSS selector, targeting elements based on class, attribute, or other characteristics.  After calling `filter()`, Isotope rearranges the visible items to maintain the chosen layout mode.\n\n\n### Multiple Filters\n\nYou can combine multiple filter criteria using standard CSS selector logic.\n\n```javascript\n// Show items with class 'category-a' AND attribute data-color=\"red\"\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a[data-color=\"red\"]' });\n\n// Show items with class 'category-a' OR class 'category-b'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a, .category-b' });\n```\n\nIsotope respects the usual AND/OR logic of CSS selectors to precisely control which items are displayed.\n\n\n### Filtering with Data Attributes\n\nData attributes are highly useful for filtering.  They allow you to store custom data associated with each item, providing a flexible way to define filtering criteria.\n\n```html\n<!-- Item with category and price data -->\n<div class=\"item\" data-category=\"electronics\" data-price=\"high\">...</div>\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Filter items with category 'electronics'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-category=\"electronics\"]' });\n\n// Filter items with price 'high'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-price=\"high\"]' });\n\n// Filter items with category 'electronics' AND price 'high'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-category=\"electronics\"][data-price=\"high\"]' });\n```\n\n\n### Filtering with JavaScript Objects\n\nFor more complex filtering logic, you can use a JavaScript object as the filter. This allows using custom filtering functions.  You'll need to define a `filter` function within the Isotope options when initializing.\n\n\n```javascript\n$grid.isotope({\n  filter: function() {\n    var filterData = this.itemData; // Access item's data\n    return filterData.category === 'electronics' && filterData.price === 'high';\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis approach enables filtering based on any arbitrary condition.\n\n\n### Advanced Filtering Techniques\n\nAdvanced filtering often involves combining selectors, data attributes, and custom filtering logic.  Here are a few examples:\n\n* **Negation:** Use the `:not()` selector to exclude items.  For example: `:not(.category-a)` excludes items with class `category-a`.\n\n* **Multiple attributes:** Chain multiple attribute selectors to combine criteria.\n\n* **Regular expressions:**  In some cases (with plugin support or custom filtering functions), regular expressions can be used to filter items based on pattern matching.\n\n\n### Live Filtering\n\nLive filtering allows updating the filter dynamically as items are added or removed from the container.  You'd typically use Isotope's `appended()` and `prepended()` methods, combined with a call to `isotope().arrange()` or `isotope().filter()` to maintain the layout and filter accordingly.  This prevents the need to re-initialize Isotope each time the content changes.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Append new items\n$grid.append(newItem).isotope('appended', newItem).isotope('arrange');\n\n//Prepend new items\n$grid.prepend(newItem).isotope('prepended', newItem).isotope('arrange');\n\n// Filter after appending/prepending\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-b' });\n\n```\n\nRemember to always call `arrange()` or `filter()` after adding or removing items to ensure that the layout reflects the changes and the current filter.  Alternatively, Isotope provides `layoutItems()` to directly perform this action and update only the affected items.  Check the Isotope documentation for the best approach based on your workflow.\n\n\nRemember to consult the Isotope documentation for the most current details and examples of filtering techniques.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Sorting Items\n\nIsotope allows you to dynamically rearrange the order of items within your layout based on specified criteria. This enhances the user experience by providing options to view content in different orders.\n\n### Basic Sorting\n\nBasic sorting involves specifying a single attribute to sort by using the `sortBy` option within the `isotope()` method.  This attribute is typically a data attribute on your items.\n\n```html\n<!-- Items with sort values -->\n<div class=\"item\" data-sort-value=\"2\">Item 2</div>\n<div class=\"item\" data-sort-value=\"1\">Item 1</div>\n<div class=\"item\" data-sort-value=\"3\">Item 3</div>\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize Isotope with sorting setup\nvar $grid = $('#grid').isotope({\n  itemSelector: '.item',\n  getSortData: {\n    value: '[data-sort-value]'\n  }\n});\n\n// Sort items by 'value' (ascending by default)\n$grid.isotope({ sortBy: 'value' });\n\n// Sort items in descending order\n$grid.isotope({ sortBy: 'value', sortAscending: false });\n```\n\nThe `getSortData` option is crucial. It tells Isotope how to extract the sorting data from each item. In this case, it extracts the value of the `data-sort-value` attribute. The key (`value`) in `getSortData` must match the `sortBy` value.\n\n\n### Sorting by Multiple Attributes\n\nYou can sort by multiple attributes by providing an array to the `sortBy` option.  Isotope will use the attributes sequentially; if items have equal values in the primary sort attribute, it will use the secondary, and so on.\n\n```javascript\n$grid.isotope({\n  sortBy: ['category', 'value'], // Sort by category then by value\n  getSortData: {\n    category: '[data-category]',\n    value: '[data-sort-value]'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis will first sort items by `data-category` and then, for items with the same category, by `data-sort-value`.\n\n\n### Sorting with Custom Functions\n\nFor more complex sorting scenarios, you can use custom sorting functions within the `getSortData` option.  This offers great flexibility.\n\n```javascript\n$grid.isotope({\n  getSortData: {\n    date: function($elem) {\n      // Extract date from element and convert to a comparable format (e.g., timestamp)\n      var dateString = $elem.attr('data-date');\n      return new Date(dateString).getTime();\n    }\n  }\n});\n$grid.isotope({sortBy: 'date'}); //Now sort by the date\n```\n\nThis example extracts a date from the element's `data-date` attribute, converts it to a timestamp, and uses that value for sorting.  The `getTime()` function allows proper numerical comparison of dates.  Remember to convert any non-numeric data (such as dates or strings requiring specific ordering) into sortable numeric values.\n\n\n\n### Sorting and Filtering Combined\n\nYou can combine sorting and filtering to create highly interactive layouts. First, filter the items, then sort the visible items within that filtered set.\n\n```javascript\n// Filter items by category\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a' });\n\n// Then sort the filtered items by value\n$grid.isotope({ sortBy: 'value' });\n```\n\nThe order of operations is important. Filtering happens first, then the sorting applies only to the items that remain visible after filtering.  This creates a dynamic, multi-faceted user experience.  Remember to always call `isotope()` with the options to apply changes; simply calling `filter()` or `sortBy` on their own does not update the layout.\n\n\nRemember to consult the Isotope documentation for the most up-to-date information on sorting options and advanced techniques.  Proper data type handling within your `getSortData` function is crucial for ensuring correct sorting results.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Item Manipulation\n\nIsotope provides methods for dynamically adding, removing, updating, and repositioning items within the layout.  Efficiently managing items is crucial for maintaining performance and a smooth user experience, especially with large datasets.\n\n### Adding Items\n\nAdding items requires appending them to the Isotope container element and then using the `appended()` method to inform Isotope of the changes.  This ensures Isotope correctly updates the layout and positions the new items.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Create a new item element\nvar newItem = $('<div class=\"item\" data-category=\"new\">New Item</div>');\n\n// Append the new item to the container\n$('#isotope-container').append(newItem);\n\n// Tell Isotope about the new item and update the layout\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('appended', newItem).isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange')\n```\n\nThe `layout()` or `arrange()` method (they're largely interchangeable, but `arrange()` might offer minor performance advantages in certain cases) triggers Isotope to reposition all items, including the newly added one.  Alternatively you can use `layoutItems()` to target the new item specifically.  Note that  `prepended()` works analogously, but adds the new item to the beginning instead of the end.\n\n\n### Removing Items\n\nRemoving items requires removing them from the DOM and using the `remove()` method to tell Isotope about the change.\n\n```javascript\n// Select the item to remove\nvar $itemToRemove = $('#isotope-container .item:first');\n\n// Remove the item from the DOM\n$itemToRemove.remove();\n\n// Tell Isotope to remove the item and update the layout\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('remove', $itemToRemove).isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange')\n```\n\n\nSimilarly to adding items,  `layout()` or `arrange()` updates the layout after removal.  Isotope will automatically adjust the positions of the remaining items.\n\n\n### Updating Items\n\nUpdating an item typically involves changing its content, attributes, or CSS styles.  After an update, inform Isotope to re-layout or reposition the affected items to correctly reflect the changes.  There's no direct update method in Isotope; you modify the item directly in the DOM and then trigger a layout update.\n\n```javascript\n// Select the item to update\nvar $itemToUpdate = $('#isotope-container .item:first');\n\n// Update the item's content\n$itemToUpdate.html('Updated Item Content');\n\n// Update any relevant data attributes (e.g., for filtering or sorting)\n$itemToUpdate.attr('data-category', 'updated');\n\n// Tell Isotope to re-layout the item (or use layoutItems for better efficiency)\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange') or isotope('layoutItems', $itemToUpdate);\n```\n\nChoosing between `layout()`, `arrange()`, and `layoutItems()` depends on the scale of your updates.  For single item updates, `layoutItems()` can improve efficiency.\n\n### Re-laying out Items\n\nSometimes you might need to force Isotope to recalculate the layout without adding or removing items.  This might be necessary after significant changes to the container's size or other factors affecting item positioning.  The `layout()` or `arrange()` methods accomplish this.\n\n```javascript\n// Trigger a layout recalculation\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange')\n```\n\nThis method is especially useful if you're dynamically resizing the container using Javascript or in response to window resizing events.\n\n\n### Item Positioning\n\nIsotope doesn't directly expose methods to explicitly reposition individual items at arbitrary coordinates.  Its layout mechanisms handle positioning based on the chosen layout mode and item sizes.  If you need very fine-grained control over item placement, consider using alternative layout methods or libraries alongside Isotope, and handle positioning outside of Isotope's layout management.  To change an item's position, you would typically modify its attributes that Isotope uses for layout (width, height, etc.)  and then trigger a layout update using `layout()` or `arrange()`.\n\n\nRemember that using Isotope's methods for adding, removing, and updating items is essential for maintaining the integrity and performance of your layout.  Failing to use these methods correctly may lead to unexpected visual issues or performance problems.  Efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the layout using `layoutItems()` when updating individual items can provide better performance for more complex layouts.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Styling and Customization\n\nIsotope provides a flexible framework for styling and customizing your layouts.  You can leverage CSS for basic styling and then use Isotope's features to add dynamic styling based on filtering, sorting, or other interactions.\n\n\n### Using CSS to Style Isotope Layouts\n\nThe primary way to style Isotope layouts is through standard CSS.  You style the container element and the individual items using CSS selectors.  Isotope itself doesn't impose specific styling; it manages positioning and layout.\n\n\n```css\n/* Style the container */\n#isotope-container {\n  width: 800px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\n/* Style the individual items */\n.item {\n  background-color: #fff;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin: 5px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n/* Style specific items based on class */\n.item.featured {\n  background-color: #e0e0e0;\n  border: 2px solid #007bff;\n}\n```\n\nYou can apply any CSS rules you need to customize the appearance of your Isotope layout.  Use standard CSS selectors to target specific elements within the layout.\n\n\n### Customizing the Transition Effect\n\nIsotope uses CSS transitions to smoothly animate item movements during layout changes (filtering, sorting, etc.).  You can customize the transition effect using CSS.\n\n\n```css\n.item {\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out; /* Adjust duration and easing as needed */\n}\n```\n\nThe `transform` property is typically used for animation as it's generally efficient. Adjust the `duration` and `ease` values to fine-tune the animation's speed and smoothness. Experiment with other CSS transition properties to create custom effects.\n\n\n### Responsive Design with Isotope\n\nIsotope works well with responsive design.  You can adjust the container size and item styles using media queries to adapt the layout to different screen sizes.\n\n\n```css\n/* Styles for large screens */\n#isotope-container {\n  width: 800px;\n}\n.item {\n  width: 200px;\n}\n\n/* Styles for medium screens */\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  #isotope-container {\n    width: 600px;\n  }\n  .item {\n    width: 150px;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Styles for small screens */\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n  #isotope-container {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  .item {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy adjusting the container's width and item sizes in your media queries, Isotope will automatically rearrange items to fit the available space on different devices.\n\n\n### Applying Custom Classes to Items\n\nYou can apply custom classes to items dynamically using JavaScript to add further visual customization. This is especially helpful for highlighting selected or filtered items.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Select an item and add a custom class\nvar $item = $('.item').eq(0);\n$item.addClass('highlight');\n```\n\nThen, style these custom classes (like `.highlight`) in your CSS to achieve specific visual effects.\n\n\n### Item Styles Based on Filter/Sort\n\nIsotope doesn't directly provide methods to apply styles based on filtering or sorting.  However, you can use JavaScript to add or remove classes based on the active filter or sort criteria.  This requires manually tracking the active filter and sort state within your Javascript code.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Add a class to sorted items\n$grid.on( 'arrangeComplete', function( event, filteredItems ) {\n  filteredItems.addClass('sorted'); //Add a class named sorted after sorting\n  $(this).find('.item:not(.sorted)').removeClass('sorted'); //Remove the sorted class from unsorted items.\n});\n```\n\nCombine this with CSS to visually distinguish items based on the sorting or filtering operation. This allows you to create visually distinct representations of your items depending on their state. Remember to remove classes appropriately to avoid unexpected visual effects.\n\n\n\nRemember that the styling and customization options are vast, and you can use any combination of CSS, Javascript, and Isotope's API to create uniquely styled and interactive layouts.  Experimentation is key to discovering the best approach for your particular application.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\nThis section covers advanced techniques for using Isotope effectively, including integration with other libraries, handling large datasets, and optimizing performance.\n\n### Integrating with Other JavaScript Libraries\n\nIsotope is designed to work well with other JavaScript libraries.  Its jQuery dependency makes integration straightforward.  Common integrations include:\n\n* **jQuery UI:**  Isotope's filtering and sorting functionality can be combined with jQuery UI widgets like draggable and droppable for creating interactive layouts.\n\n* **Other UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular):**  While Isotope itself is a jQuery plugin, you can integrate it into modern frameworks using techniques like wrapping Isotope within a component or using a library to bridge jQuery and the framework's DOM manipulation methods.\n\n\n* **Image loading libraries (LazySizes, etc.):**  Combine Isotope with lazy-loading libraries to improve page load times when dealing with many images.  This is especially important for large image galleries.\n\n* **Infinite scrolling libraries:**  Enhance the user experience by integrating infinite scrolling to fetch and display more items as the user scrolls down, thereby avoiding loading all items at once.\n\n\nRemember to carefully manage the order of script inclusion to ensure proper library dependencies.  Always include jQuery before Isotope, and other libraries as needed, ensuring any framework-specific integration handles potential conflicts.\n\n\n### Using Isotope with Different Data Sources (JSON)\n\nIsotope primarily works with items that already exist in the DOM.  However, you can fetch data from various sources (like JSON APIs) and dynamically create the HTML elements for Isotope.\n\n\n```javascript\n$.getJSON('data.json', function(data) {\n  var $grid = $('#isotope-container');\n  $.each(data, function(index, item) {\n    var $item = $('<div class=\"item\" data-category=\"' + item.category + '\">' + item.title + '</div>');\n    $grid.append($item);\n  });\n  $grid.isotope({\n    itemSelector: '.item',\n    // ... other Isotope options\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis code fetches JSON data, creates HTML elements for each item, appends them to the container, and then initializes Isotope. Ensure that your data includes attributes that Isotope will use for filtering or sorting (if needed).  Error handling (e.g., if the JSON fetch fails) is crucial for robust applications.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Layout Modes\n\nIsotope allows creating custom layout modes to handle unique arrangement requirements.  This involves creating a JavaScript class that extends Isotope's `LayoutMode` class and implementing its methods (`_resetLayout`, `_getItemLayoutPosition`, `_getContainerSize`, etc.).  The Isotope documentation provides detailed instructions on this advanced feature.  Custom layout modes allow for highly specialized visual designs tailored to your needs.\n\n### Handling Large Datasets\n\nWhen dealing with large datasets, optimizing performance is crucial.  Techniques include:\n\n* **Pagination:** Divide data into pages to reduce the initial load and render only the currently visible items.\n\n* **Virtualization:**  Only render the visible items; render additional items as the user scrolls or interacts with the layout.  Libraries designed for virtualized lists can be very beneficial here.\n\n* **Asynchronous loading:** Load data in chunks or dynamically as needed instead of loading everything at once.\n\n* **Efficient selectors:** Use specific and efficient CSS selectors in your `itemSelector` to avoid unnecessary DOM traversal.\n\n* **Debouncing/throttling:**  Avoid excessive layout recalculations by debouncing or throttling events that trigger layout updates (e.g., window resize events).\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nPerformance optimization for Isotope involves several strategies:\n\n* **Minimize DOM manipulations:**  Avoid frequent additions or removals of items unless absolutely necessary.  Batch updates when possible.\n\n* **Efficient selectors:**  Use well-defined, specific CSS selectors for optimal performance.\n\n* **Layout optimization:**  Choose the layout mode most suitable for your data and visual requirements.  Avoid unnecessarily complex layouts.\n\n* **Use of `layoutItems()`:** For targeted updates (adding, removing, or updating a few items),  `layoutItems()` is much more efficient than `layout()` or `arrange()`, as it only repositions the affected items, rather than all.\n\n\n* **Image optimization:**  Optimize images (size and format) to minimize load times.  Lazy loading of images can also significantly help.\n\n\n### Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues and debugging strategies:\n\n* **Layout problems:** Check the container's size, item dimensions, and CSS styles. Ensure that items are correctly measured and positioned.  Inspect the rendered HTML and CSS in your browser's developer tools to identify layout inconsistencies.\n\n* **Filtering/sorting issues:** Verify your filter selectors and sorting data.  Use the browser's developer tools to debug your JavaScript code and inspect the data being used by Isotope.\n\n* **Performance issues:**  Profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks.  Use your browser's developer tools to check for excessive reflows and repaints.  Consider optimizations for large datasets and avoid unnecessary layout recalculations.\n\n* **Conflicts with other libraries:**  Carefully check for conflicts between Isotope and other JavaScript libraries.  Manage the order of script inclusion carefully.  Consult the Isotope documentation and other library documentations to prevent conflicting usage of methods, selectors, or other resources.\n\n\nBy following these advanced techniques and best practices, you can create efficient, performant, and visually appealing Isotope layouts capable of handling large amounts of data and seamlessly integrating with other parts of your applications.  Remember to consult the Isotope documentation for up-to-date information and best practices.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a detailed reference for Isotope's API, including the constructor, methods, events, and options.  Refer to the official Isotope documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive API details.\n\n\n### Isotope Constructor\n\nThe Isotope constructor initializes the Isotope layout on a given container element.  It takes a single argument: an options object.  This object configures various aspects of the Isotope layout.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Basic initialization\nvar $grid = $('#container').isotope({\n  itemSelector: '.item', // Required option: selector for items within the container\n  layoutMode: 'masonry' // Optional option: default layout mode\n});\n```\n\nThe `itemSelector` is required; it specifies the CSS selector to identify individual items within the container.  Other options (like `layoutMode`) are optional and provide more customization.\n\n\n### Methods\n\nIsotope offers several methods to interact with and manipulate the layout.  Many methods can be chained together for more complex operations.  These method calls return the Isotope instance which allows chaining.\n\n* **`layout()` or `arrange()`:**  Re-layouts all items in the container.  Useful after adding, removing, or updating items.  `arrange()` may provide slight performance benefits in certain situations.\n\n* **`filter(selector)`:**  Filters the items based on the provided CSS selector.  Only items matching the selector will be visible.\n\n* **`sort(options)`:**  Sorts the items based on the options provided in an object (usually including `sortBy` and `getSortData`).\n\n* **`appended(elems)`:** Adds new elements to the layout.  `elems` is a jQuery collection of the elements to add.\n\n* **`prepended(elems)`:**  Similar to `appended()`, but adds elements to the beginning of the layout.\n\n* **`remove(elems)`:** Removes elements from the layout. `elems` is a jQuery collection of the elements to remove.\n\n* **`layoutItems(elems, isLayoutInstant)`:** Relays out only the specified elements (`elems`), improving performance over a full `layout()` when only some items need repositioning.  `isLayoutInstant` (optional, defaults to `false`) will avoid animation.\n\n* **`destroy()`:**  Completely removes Isotope from the container, restoring the original HTML structure and removing event handlers.\n\n* **`getItemElements()`:** Returns a jQuery collection of all item elements.\n\n* **`getFilteredItemElements()`:** Returns a jQuery collection of only the currently visible (filtered) item elements.\n\n\n\n### Events\n\nIsotope triggers several events during different stages of its operation.  You can use these events to perform actions based on layout changes, filter updates, or sorting operations.\n\n\n* **`layoutComplete`:** Triggered after the layout is complete.  Useful for executing actions that depend on the final item positions.\n\n* **`arrangeComplete`:** Similar to `layoutComplete`, triggered after the items are arranged.  Generally interchangeable, but `arrangeComplete` is more descriptive when specifically triggered by methods like `filter()` and `sort()`.\n\n* **`arrangeStart`:** Triggered at the beginning of an arrangement.  Useful for providing a loading indicator or pausing other processes until the layout is complete.\n\n* **`updateLayout`:** Triggered whenever the layout starts recalculating.  This event can be used for UI feedback, such as showing a loading indicator while the layout is being updated.\n\n* **`filterComplete`:**  Triggered after filtering is complete.\n\n\nExample of using an event:\n\n\n```javascript\n$grid.on( 'layoutComplete', function( event, filteredItems ) {\n  console.log( 'Layout complete. Number of visible items:', filteredItems.length );\n});\n```\n\n\n### Options\n\nThe Isotope constructor accepts an options object with various properties to configure the layout's behavior.  The most commonly used options include:\n\n\n* **`itemSelector` (required):** CSS selector for identifying items within the container.\n\n* **`layoutMode` (optional):**  Specifies the layout mode ('masonry', 'fitRows', 'fitColumns', 'cellsByRow', 'cellsByColumn', 'straightDown', etc.).  Defaults to 'masonry'.\n\n* **`percentPosition` (optional, boolean):**  Allows positioning items using percentages instead of pixels.  Useful for responsive layouts.  Defaults to `false`.\n\n* **`transitionDuration` (optional, string):**  Specifies the duration of the CSS transition for item movements.\n\n* **`stagger` (optional, number):**  Adds a delay between item animations to create a staggered effect.\n\n* **`getSortData` (optional, object):**  Defines how to extract sort data from items.  Used in conjunction with `sortBy`.\n\n* **`sortBy` (optional, string or array):**  Specifies the attribute(s) to sort items by.\n\n* **`sortAscending` (optional, boolean):**  Determines the sorting order (ascending or descending).  Defaults to `true` (ascending).\n\n\n* **`filter` (optional, string or function):**  Sets an initial filter for the layout upon initialization.\n\n\nRemember to consult the official Isotope documentation for a comprehensive list of options and their descriptions.  The availability of and necessity for each option will depend on the complexity and requirements of your layout.\n\n\nThis API reference provides a foundational understanding.  Thoroughly reviewing the complete Isotope documentation is recommended for advanced usage and addressing specific scenarios.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nIsotope's flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. This section explores several common use cases and provides guidance on implementing them effectively.\n\n\n### Image Gallery\n\nIsotope excels at creating responsive and dynamic image galleries.  Items can be images of varying sizes, each potentially linked to a larger version or detailed information.  Filtering can be implemented to allow users to browse images by category, tag, or other criteria.\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"image-gallery\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item nature\"><img src=\"nature1.jpg\" alt=\"Nature 1\"></div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item portrait\"><img src=\"portrait1.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait 1\"></div>\n  <!-- ... more images ... -->\n</div>\n<button data-filter=\"*\">Show All</button>\n<button data-filter=\".nature\">Nature</button>\n<button data-filter=\".portrait\">Portrait</button>\n```\n\nJavaScript would then initialize Isotope and handle filtering based on button clicks.  Consider using lazy loading for improved performance if you have many images.\n\n\n### Portfolio Showcase\n\nIsotope is ideal for presenting a portfolio of work.  Each item can represent a project, with an image, title, and brief description.  Filtering allows users to view projects by category (e.g., web design, graphic design, photography).  Sorting could provide options to view projects by date, client, or other criteria.\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"portfolio\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item web-design\">Project 1</div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item graphic-design\">Project 2</div>\n  <!-- ... more projects ... -->\n</div>\n<button data-filter=\"*\">Show All</button>\n<button data-filter=\".web-design\">Web Design</button>\n<button data-filter=\".graphic-design\">Graphic Design</button>\n```\n\nThe Javascript would handle the initialization of Isotope and the filtering.  Consider adding more details like project descriptions and links on hover or click.\n\n\n### Product Catalog\n\nIsotope can create an interactive product catalog.  Each item represents a product, displaying an image, name, price, and perhaps a short description.  Filtering allows users to browse products by category, price range, or features.  Sorting could order products by price, popularity, or newness.\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"product-catalog\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item electronics\" data-price=\"199\">Product A</div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item clothing\" data-price=\"49\">Product B</div>\n  <!-- ... more products ... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThe Javascript would manage filtering by category and price range, and sorting by price (ascending or descending).  Consider adding pagination for larger catalogs.\n\n\n### Blog Archive\n\nIsotope can organize a blog archive, displaying blog posts in a visually appealing layout.  Each item represents a blog post, displaying a title, image, short excerpt, and link to the full post.  Filtering could categorize posts by topic or tag.  Sorting might allow users to view posts by date (newest or oldest).\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"blog-archive\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item technology\">Blog Post 1</div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item travel\">Blog Post 2</div>\n  <!-- ... more blog posts ... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThe Javascript would handle the filtering and sorting, potentially allowing users to view posts by date (newest first, oldest first).\n\n\n### Dynamic Content Updates\n\nIsotope shines in applications involving dynamic content updates.  New items can be added or existing items can be modified (e.g., changing product prices or adding new blog posts) without requiring a full page reload.  Isotope's methods (`appended`, `prepended`, `remove`, `layout`) are essential for maintaining a fluid and responsive user experience.\n\n\nFor all examples, remember to include appropriate CSS for styling the container and items.  Proper image optimization and lazy loading are also crucial for performance, especially with image-heavy layouts. The specific Javascript code will depend on the chosen filtering and sorting implementation.  Consider using data attributes for storing filtering and sorting information (e.g., `data-category`, `data-price`, `data-date`).  These examples demonstrate the adaptability of Isotope across various content types.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Introduction to Isotope\n\n### What is Isotope?\n\nIsotope is a powerful and flexible JavaScript library that provides an elegant solution for dynamically creating and managing layouts of items within a container.  Think of it as a sophisticated, responsive grid system that allows for flexible sorting, filtering, and rearranging of content on the fly, without the need for page reloads.  Isotope uses a masonry-style layout by default, offering a visually appealing and efficient way to display items of varying sizes, but it supports numerous layout modes.  It's ideal for applications such as image galleries, product catalogs, portfolio displays, and any dynamic content arrangement where responsiveness and user interaction are key.\n\n### Why use Isotope?\n\n* **Dynamic Layout:**  Easily rearrange items in response to user actions or changes in content, without complex manual DOM manipulation.\n\n* **Responsive Design:**  Automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal presentation across various devices.\n\n* **Multiple Layout Modes:**  Choose from several pre-defined layout modes (masonry, fitRows, cellsByRow, cellsByColumn, straightDown, etc.) or create custom layouts to suit your specific needs.\n\n* **Filtering and Sorting:**  Quickly filter and sort items based on defined criteria, providing a more intuitive user experience.\n\n* **Easy Integration:**  Integrates seamlessly with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.\n\n* **Well-Documented and Supported:**  Extensive documentation and a helpful community make it easy to learn and use.\n\n* **Performance Optimized:**  Designed for efficiency, handling large numbers of items without significant performance degradation.\n\n\n### Setting up Isotope: Including the Library\n\nThere are several ways to include the Isotope library in your project:\n\n**1. Download and Include:**\n\nDownload the Isotope JavaScript file (e.g., `isotope.pkgd.min.js`) from the official Isotope website and include it in your HTML file within `<script>` tags, placing it before your custom JavaScript code:\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Isotope Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/style.css\">  </head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"isotope-container\">\n    <!-- Your isotope items will go here -->\n  </div>\n  <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"js/isotope.pkgd.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"js/script.js\"></script> </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**2. Using a CDN:**  You can also use a CDN to include Isotope, eliminating the need to download the file.  Several CDNs host Isotope; check the official Isotope website for the most up-to-date links.  This method is generally preferred for ease of use and consistent access.  For example, using jsDelivr:\n\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/isotope-layout@3/dist/isotope.pkgd.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**3. Using a Package Manager (npm or yarn):**\n\nIf you're using a package manager like npm or yarn, you can install Isotope as a dependency:\n\n```bash\nnpm install isotope-layout\n# or\nyarn add isotope-layout\n```\n\nThen, import it into your JavaScript file using a module bundler such as Webpack or Parcel.  (Specific import syntax will depend on your bundler).\n\n\n**Note:**  Isotope relies on jQuery. Ensure that jQuery is included *before* the Isotope library in your HTML file. You can include it via a CDN or download it locally.\n\n\n### Basic Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple Isotope setup with a masonry layout:\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Isotope Basic Example</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/isotope-layout@3/dist/isotope.min.css\">\n  <style>\n    #isotope-container {\n      width: 800px; /* Adjust as needed */\n    }\n    .item {\n      width: 200px;\n      height: 150px;\n      background-color: #eee;\n      margin: 10px;\n      float: left; /* Needed for initial display */\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div id=\"isotope-container\">\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 1</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 2</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 3</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 4</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 5</div>\n  <div class=\"item\">Item 6</div>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/isotope-layout@3/dist/isotope.pkgd.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(document).ready(function() {\n    $('#isotope-container').isotope({\n      itemSelector: '.item',\n      layoutMode: 'masonry'\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code creates a container (`#isotope-container`) with several items. The JavaScript initializes Isotope, specifying the item selector (`.item`) and the layout mode (`masonry`).  This simple example showcases the core functionality. The subsequent sections of this manual will delve into more advanced features and options.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Items and Containers\n\nIsotope operates on two fundamental elements: **items** and the **container**.\n\n* **Container:** This is the HTML element that holds all the items you want Isotope to manage.  It's typically a `<div>` or similar element.  You specify this container element when initializing Isotope.\n\n* **Items:** These are the individual elements within the container that Isotope arranges and manipulates.  They can be any type of HTML element (e.g., `<div>`, `<img>`, `<li>`), and they're usually visually distinct elements like images, product listings, or blog posts.  Isotope identifies these items based on the `itemSelector` option (explained below).\n\nIt's crucial that your items are already present in the DOM within the container *before* you initialize Isotope.\n\n### Item Selectors\n\nThe `itemSelector` option is vital for Isotope's functionality.  It tells Isotope which elements within the container should be treated as individual items. This is a CSS selector string (similar to what you'd use in jQuery or other CSS-related JavaScript libraries).\n\nFor example:\n\n* `'.item'` selects all elements with the class `item`.\n* `'li'` selects all list items within the container.\n* `'div.product'` selects all `<div>` elements with the class `product`.\n\nChoosing an appropriate and efficient selector is crucial for Isotope's performance, particularly with a large number of items.  Avoid overly general selectors that might unintentionally select unwanted elements.\n\n### Layout Modes\n\nIsotope offers various layout modes that determine how items are arranged within the container. The most common is `masonry`, but other options provide different visual effects and organizational strategies.  Here are some key layout modes:\n\n* **`masonry`:** A classic staggered layout where items stack in a visually appealing, irregular grid.  This is often the default and best suited for items of varying heights.\n\n* **`fitRows`:** Items are placed from left to right, filling each row to the fullest extent before moving to the next row.  This is ideal for items with consistent heights.\n\n* **`fitColumns`:**  The vertical equivalent of `fitRows`. Items are placed from top to bottom, filling each column to the fullest extent before moving to the next column. Ideal for items of consistent widths.\n\n\n* **`cellsByRow`:** Creates a regular grid with cells of a specified size (using the `cells` option). Items fill the grid cells sequentially.\n\n* **`cellsByColumn`:** Similar to `cellsByRow`, but fills the grid cells column by column.\n\n\n* **`straightDown`:** Items are stacked vertically, one on top of another. This is effectively a single-column layout.\n\n\n\nYou specify the layout mode using the `layoutMode` option when initializing Isotope.  For custom layout modes, you can extend Isotope's functionality by creating your own layout class.  Refer to the advanced sections of this manual and the Isotope documentation for more details.\n\n### Filtering\n\nIsotope's filtering capabilities allow you to dynamically show or hide items based on specific criteria. You can filter items based on attributes, classes, or any other criteria that you define.\n\nFiltering is typically achieved using the `filter()` method.  The argument to `filter()` is a selector string. This string acts as a filter determining which elements are kept visible.  For example:\n\n* `'.category-a'` would display only items with the class `category-a`.\n* `'[data-price=\"low\"]'` would display items with the data attribute `data-price` set to \"low\".\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({ /* ... */ });\n$('#filter-buttons button').on('click', function() {\n  var filterValue = $(this).attr('data-filter');\n  $('#isotope-container').isotope({ filter: filterValue });\n});\n```\n\nThis code adds event listeners to filter buttons. Each button has a `data-filter` attribute specifying the filter selector.  Clicking a button updates the Isotope filter.\n\n\n### Sorting\n\nSorting in Isotope allows you to rearrange the order of items within the container based on defined criteria.  Similar to filtering, sorting uses the `sortItems()` method and relies on a `sortBy` option when initializing or using `isotope()`\n\n\nThe `sortBy` option accepts a string that specifies the sorting criteria. This is typically a data attribute on the items to sort by.  Isotope can sort items in ascending or descending order based on various criteria such as:\n\n* **Numerical values:**  Use data attributes containing numbers (e.g., `data-sort-value=\"10\"`).\n* **Strings:** Use data attributes containing strings.  String comparisons will be alphabetic.\n* **Dates:** Use data attributes representing dates.  You'll need to convert them to Date objects for correct sorting (Isotope doesn't handle date string comparisons directly).\n\n\nExample (sorting by numerical value):\n\n```javascript\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({\n    itemSelector: '.item',\n    layoutMode: 'masonry',\n    getSortData: {\n        value: '[data-value]' // extract data-value attribute from elements\n    }\n});\n\n\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({ sortBy: 'value' }); // Sort in ascending order by default\n$('#isotope-container').isotope({ sortBy: 'value', sortAscending: false }); // Sort in descending order\n```\n\n\nRemember to include the `getSortData` option with  `sortBy` to tell Isotope how to extract the sorting data from your items. The key (`value` in the example) should match the name used in `sortBy`.  For more complex sorting scenarios, you can provide a custom function in `getSortData`.  Consult the Isotope documentation for details on custom sorting.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Layout Modes\n\nIsotope provides a variety of pre-built layout modes to arrange items within a container.  You select a layout mode using the `layoutMode` option when initializing Isotope.  Each mode offers a different visual effect and is better suited for specific use cases.\n\n### Masonry\n\nThe `masonry` layout mode is Isotope's most popular and widely used layout. It creates a visually appealing, staggered grid, similar to a brick wall. Items are placed in rows, with varying heights allowed, creating a dynamic and organic look.  Items are positioned as high as possible without overlapping.  This is often the ideal choice for showcasing images or items of diverse heights.\n\n\n### Fit Rows\n\nThe `fitRows` layout mode places items from left to right, filling each row completely before moving to the next. This layout is best suited for items of similar height.  It creates a neat, grid-like structure, often preferred for consistent displays.  Items will not overlap; if an item is too wide for a row, it will start a new row.\n\n\n### Cells by Columns\n\nThe `cellsByColumn` layout mode arranges items into a grid based on specified cell widths and heights. Items are placed in cells, filling columns from top to bottom.  This requires you to specify the `cells` option (an array of width and height) when initializing Isotope. It's good for creating clean, evenly spaced grids with fixed cell dimensions.\n\n\n\n### Cells by Row\n\nThe `cellsByRow` layout mode is analogous to `cellsByColumn`, but instead of filling columns from top to bottom, it fills rows from left to right.  Similar to `cellsByColumn`, it requires the `cells` option for specifying the grid's cell dimensions.  It's ideal for situations where a row-major ordering is preferred for the grid.\n\n\n### Horizontal\n\nThe `horizontal` layout mode arranges items horizontally, in a single row. This is a simple linear layout, suitable when you only want items displayed in a sequence along a single axis.\n\n\n### Vertical\n\nThe `vertical` layout mode arranges items vertically, stacked one on top of another. It creates a single-column layout, suitable when a vertical list display is desired.\n\n\n### Justified\n\nThe `justified` layout mode (often requiring a plugin or additional setup) aims to evenly distribute items within rows, attempting to make each row the same height. The implementation details can vary depending on the specific Isotope extension or library used. It's ideal for creating visually balanced rows, but can sometimes lead to uneven spacing between items.\n\n\n### Packery\n\nPackery is not a built-in layout mode of Isotope itself, but rather a separate library often used in conjunction with it. Packery provides a layout that's similar to masonry but offers more advanced features and handling of complex item sizes and shapes. It's particularly helpful when dealing with items that may have unusual aspect ratios.  It would need to be integrated separately.\n\n\n### Column\n\nA `column` layout mode (often implemented as a custom or plugin extension) divides the container into a specified number of columns and distributes items evenly among them. It creates a grid-like structure with equal column widths.  This mode may require additional setup or a plugin.\n\n\n### Staggered\n\nWhile \"staggered\" might seem synonymous with \"masonry,\" the term generally implies a less rigid, more freely positioned arrangement of items, where precise row alignment isn't strictly enforced. In Isotope, this effect is typically achieved using the `masonry` layout mode with variations in item height.\n\n\n### Custom Layout Modes\n\nIsotope's flexibility extends to creating completely custom layout modes.  This involves writing a JavaScript class that extends Isotope's `LayoutMode` class and implements its methods.  Custom layout modes allow you to design entirely new arrangements based on your application's specific needs.  The Isotope documentation provides detailed information on extending Isotope and developing custom layouts.  This is an advanced topic requiring a solid understanding of JavaScript and Isotope's internal workings.\n\n\nRemember to consult the Isotope documentation for the most up-to-date information on available layout modes, their options, and any required plugins or dependencies.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Filtering Items\n\nIsotope's filtering capabilities allow you to dynamically show and hide items within your layout based on various criteria. This is a powerful tool for creating interactive and responsive interfaces.\n\n### Basic Filtering\n\nThe simplest form of filtering uses a CSS selector string passed to the `isotope().filter()` method. This selector determines which items remain visible.\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize Isotope\nvar $grid = $('#grid').isotope({\n  // options...\n});\n\n// Filter items with class 'category-a'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a' });\n\n// Filter items with attribute data-price=\"low\"\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-price=\"low\"]' });\n```\n\nThe filter string works exactly like a CSS selector, targeting elements based on class, attribute, or other characteristics.  After calling `filter()`, Isotope rearranges the visible items to maintain the chosen layout mode.\n\n\n### Multiple Filters\n\nYou can combine multiple filter criteria using standard CSS selector logic.\n\n```javascript\n// Show items with class 'category-a' AND attribute data-color=\"red\"\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a[data-color=\"red\"]' });\n\n// Show items with class 'category-a' OR class 'category-b'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a, .category-b' });\n```\n\nIsotope respects the usual AND/OR logic of CSS selectors to precisely control which items are displayed.\n\n\n### Filtering with Data Attributes\n\nData attributes are highly useful for filtering.  They allow you to store custom data associated with each item, providing a flexible way to define filtering criteria.\n\n```html\n<!-- Item with category and price data -->\n<div class=\"item\" data-category=\"electronics\" data-price=\"high\">...</div>\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Filter items with category 'electronics'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-category=\"electronics\"]' });\n\n// Filter items with price 'high'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-price=\"high\"]' });\n\n// Filter items with category 'electronics' AND price 'high'\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '[data-category=\"electronics\"][data-price=\"high\"]' });\n```\n\n\n### Filtering with JavaScript Objects\n\nFor more complex filtering logic, you can use a JavaScript object as the filter. This allows using custom filtering functions.  You'll need to define a `filter` function within the Isotope options when initializing.\n\n\n```javascript\n$grid.isotope({\n  filter: function() {\n    var filterData = this.itemData; // Access item's data\n    return filterData.category === 'electronics' && filterData.price === 'high';\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis approach enables filtering based on any arbitrary condition.\n\n\n### Advanced Filtering Techniques\n\nAdvanced filtering often involves combining selectors, data attributes, and custom filtering logic.  Here are a few examples:\n\n* **Negation:** Use the `:not()` selector to exclude items.  For example: `:not(.category-a)` excludes items with class `category-a`.\n\n* **Multiple attributes:** Chain multiple attribute selectors to combine criteria.\n\n* **Regular expressions:**  In some cases (with plugin support or custom filtering functions), regular expressions can be used to filter items based on pattern matching.\n\n\n### Live Filtering\n\nLive filtering allows updating the filter dynamically as items are added or removed from the container.  You'd typically use Isotope's `appended()` and `prepended()` methods, combined with a call to `isotope().arrange()` or `isotope().filter()` to maintain the layout and filter accordingly.  This prevents the need to re-initialize Isotope each time the content changes.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Append new items\n$grid.append(newItem).isotope('appended', newItem).isotope('arrange');\n\n//Prepend new items\n$grid.prepend(newItem).isotope('prepended', newItem).isotope('arrange');\n\n// Filter after appending/prepending\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-b' });\n\n```\n\nRemember to always call `arrange()` or `filter()` after adding or removing items to ensure that the layout reflects the changes and the current filter.  Alternatively, Isotope provides `layoutItems()` to directly perform this action and update only the affected items.  Check the Isotope documentation for the best approach based on your workflow.\n\n\nRemember to consult the Isotope documentation for the most current details and examples of filtering techniques.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Sorting Items\n\nIsotope allows you to dynamically rearrange the order of items within your layout based on specified criteria. This enhances the user experience by providing options to view content in different orders.\n\n### Basic Sorting\n\nBasic sorting involves specifying a single attribute to sort by using the `sortBy` option within the `isotope()` method.  This attribute is typically a data attribute on your items.\n\n```html\n<!-- Items with sort values -->\n<div class=\"item\" data-sort-value=\"2\">Item 2</div>\n<div class=\"item\" data-sort-value=\"1\">Item 1</div>\n<div class=\"item\" data-sort-value=\"3\">Item 3</div>\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Initialize Isotope with sorting setup\nvar $grid = $('#grid').isotope({\n  itemSelector: '.item',\n  getSortData: {\n    value: '[data-sort-value]'\n  }\n});\n\n// Sort items by 'value' (ascending by default)\n$grid.isotope({ sortBy: 'value' });\n\n// Sort items in descending order\n$grid.isotope({ sortBy: 'value', sortAscending: false });\n```\n\nThe `getSortData` option is crucial. It tells Isotope how to extract the sorting data from each item. In this case, it extracts the value of the `data-sort-value` attribute. The key (`value`) in `getSortData` must match the `sortBy` value.\n\n\n### Sorting by Multiple Attributes\n\nYou can sort by multiple attributes by providing an array to the `sortBy` option.  Isotope will use the attributes sequentially; if items have equal values in the primary sort attribute, it will use the secondary, and so on.\n\n```javascript\n$grid.isotope({\n  sortBy: ['category', 'value'], // Sort by category then by value\n  getSortData: {\n    category: '[data-category]',\n    value: '[data-sort-value]'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis will first sort items by `data-category` and then, for items with the same category, by `data-sort-value`.\n\n\n### Sorting with Custom Functions\n\nFor more complex sorting scenarios, you can use custom sorting functions within the `getSortData` option.  This offers great flexibility.\n\n```javascript\n$grid.isotope({\n  getSortData: {\n    date: function($elem) {\n      // Extract date from element and convert to a comparable format (e.g., timestamp)\n      var dateString = $elem.attr('data-date');\n      return new Date(dateString).getTime();\n    }\n  }\n});\n$grid.isotope({sortBy: 'date'}); //Now sort by the date\n```\n\nThis example extracts a date from the element's `data-date` attribute, converts it to a timestamp, and uses that value for sorting.  The `getTime()` function allows proper numerical comparison of dates.  Remember to convert any non-numeric data (such as dates or strings requiring specific ordering) into sortable numeric values.\n\n\n\n### Sorting and Filtering Combined\n\nYou can combine sorting and filtering to create highly interactive layouts. First, filter the items, then sort the visible items within that filtered set.\n\n```javascript\n// Filter items by category\n$grid.isotope({ filter: '.category-a' });\n\n// Then sort the filtered items by value\n$grid.isotope({ sortBy: 'value' });\n```\n\nThe order of operations is important. Filtering happens first, then the sorting applies only to the items that remain visible after filtering.  This creates a dynamic, multi-faceted user experience.  Remember to always call `isotope()` with the options to apply changes; simply calling `filter()` or `sortBy` on their own does not update the layout.\n\n\nRemember to consult the Isotope documentation for the most up-to-date information on sorting options and advanced techniques.  Proper data type handling within your `getSortData` function is crucial for ensuring correct sorting results.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Item Manipulation\n\nIsotope provides methods for dynamically adding, removing, updating, and repositioning items within the layout.  Efficiently managing items is crucial for maintaining performance and a smooth user experience, especially with large datasets.\n\n### Adding Items\n\nAdding items requires appending them to the Isotope container element and then using the `appended()` method to inform Isotope of the changes.  This ensures Isotope correctly updates the layout and positions the new items.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Create a new item element\nvar newItem = $('<div class=\"item\" data-category=\"new\">New Item</div>');\n\n// Append the new item to the container\n$('#isotope-container').append(newItem);\n\n// Tell Isotope about the new item and update the layout\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('appended', newItem).isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange')\n```\n\nThe `layout()` or `arrange()` method (they're largely interchangeable, but `arrange()` might offer minor performance advantages in certain cases) triggers Isotope to reposition all items, including the newly added one.  Alternatively you can use `layoutItems()` to target the new item specifically.  Note that  `prepended()` works analogously, but adds the new item to the beginning instead of the end.\n\n\n### Removing Items\n\nRemoving items requires removing them from the DOM and using the `remove()` method to tell Isotope about the change.\n\n```javascript\n// Select the item to remove\nvar $itemToRemove = $('#isotope-container .item:first');\n\n// Remove the item from the DOM\n$itemToRemove.remove();\n\n// Tell Isotope to remove the item and update the layout\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('remove', $itemToRemove).isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange')\n```\n\n\nSimilarly to adding items,  `layout()` or `arrange()` updates the layout after removal.  Isotope will automatically adjust the positions of the remaining items.\n\n\n### Updating Items\n\nUpdating an item typically involves changing its content, attributes, or CSS styles.  After an update, inform Isotope to re-layout or reposition the affected items to correctly reflect the changes.  There's no direct update method in Isotope; you modify the item directly in the DOM and then trigger a layout update.\n\n```javascript\n// Select the item to update\nvar $itemToUpdate = $('#isotope-container .item:first');\n\n// Update the item's content\n$itemToUpdate.html('Updated Item Content');\n\n// Update any relevant data attributes (e.g., for filtering or sorting)\n$itemToUpdate.attr('data-category', 'updated');\n\n// Tell Isotope to re-layout the item (or use layoutItems for better efficiency)\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange') or isotope('layoutItems', $itemToUpdate);\n```\n\nChoosing between `layout()`, `arrange()`, and `layoutItems()` depends on the scale of your updates.  For single item updates, `layoutItems()` can improve efficiency.\n\n### Re-laying out Items\n\nSometimes you might need to force Isotope to recalculate the layout without adding or removing items.  This might be necessary after significant changes to the container's size or other factors affecting item positioning.  The `layout()` or `arrange()` methods accomplish this.\n\n```javascript\n// Trigger a layout recalculation\n$('#isotope-container').isotope('layout'); // or isotope('arrange')\n```\n\nThis method is especially useful if you're dynamically resizing the container using Javascript or in response to window resizing events.\n\n\n### Item Positioning\n\nIsotope doesn't directly expose methods to explicitly reposition individual items at arbitrary coordinates.  Its layout mechanisms handle positioning based on the chosen layout mode and item sizes.  If you need very fine-grained control over item placement, consider using alternative layout methods or libraries alongside Isotope, and handle positioning outside of Isotope's layout management.  To change an item's position, you would typically modify its attributes that Isotope uses for layout (width, height, etc.)  and then trigger a layout update using `layout()` or `arrange()`.\n\n\nRemember that using Isotope's methods for adding, removing, and updating items is essential for maintaining the integrity and performance of your layout.  Failing to use these methods correctly may lead to unexpected visual issues or performance problems.  Efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the layout using `layoutItems()` when updating individual items can provide better performance for more complex layouts.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Styling and Customization\n\nIsotope provides a flexible framework for styling and customizing your layouts.  You can leverage CSS for basic styling and then use Isotope's features to add dynamic styling based on filtering, sorting, or other interactions.\n\n\n### Using CSS to Style Isotope Layouts\n\nThe primary way to style Isotope layouts is through standard CSS.  You style the container element and the individual items using CSS selectors.  Isotope itself doesn't impose specific styling; it manages positioning and layout.\n\n\n```css\n/* Style the container */\n#isotope-container {\n  width: 800px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n\n/* Style the individual items */\n.item {\n  background-color: #fff;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin: 5px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n/* Style specific items based on class */\n.item.featured {\n  background-color: #e0e0e0;\n  border: 2px solid #007bff;\n}\n```\n\nYou can apply any CSS rules you need to customize the appearance of your Isotope layout.  Use standard CSS selectors to target specific elements within the layout.\n\n\n### Customizing the Transition Effect\n\nIsotope uses CSS transitions to smoothly animate item movements during layout changes (filtering, sorting, etc.).  You can customize the transition effect using CSS.\n\n\n```css\n.item {\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out; /* Adjust duration and easing as needed */\n}\n```\n\nThe `transform` property is typically used for animation as it's generally efficient. Adjust the `duration` and `ease` values to fine-tune the animation's speed and smoothness. Experiment with other CSS transition properties to create custom effects.\n\n\n### Responsive Design with Isotope\n\nIsotope works well with responsive design.  You can adjust the container size and item styles using media queries to adapt the layout to different screen sizes.\n\n\n```css\n/* Styles for large screens */\n#isotope-container {\n  width: 800px;\n}\n.item {\n  width: 200px;\n}\n\n/* Styles for medium screens */\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  #isotope-container {\n    width: 600px;\n  }\n  .item {\n    width: 150px;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Styles for small screens */\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n  #isotope-container {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  .item {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy adjusting the container's width and item sizes in your media queries, Isotope will automatically rearrange items to fit the available space on different devices.\n\n\n### Applying Custom Classes to Items\n\nYou can apply custom classes to items dynamically using JavaScript to add further visual customization. This is especially helpful for highlighting selected or filtered items.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Select an item and add a custom class\nvar $item = $('.item').eq(0);\n$item.addClass('highlight');\n```\n\nThen, style these custom classes (like `.highlight`) in your CSS to achieve specific visual effects.\n\n\n### Item Styles Based on Filter/Sort\n\nIsotope doesn't directly provide methods to apply styles based on filtering or sorting.  However, you can use JavaScript to add or remove classes based on the active filter or sort criteria.  This requires manually tracking the active filter and sort state within your Javascript code.\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Add a class to sorted items\n$grid.on( 'arrangeComplete', function( event, filteredItems ) {\n  filteredItems.addClass('sorted'); //Add a class named sorted after sorting\n  $(this).find('.item:not(.sorted)').removeClass('sorted'); //Remove the sorted class from unsorted items.\n});\n```\n\nCombine this with CSS to visually distinguish items based on the sorting or filtering operation. This allows you to create visually distinct representations of your items depending on their state. Remember to remove classes appropriately to avoid unexpected visual effects.\n\n\n\nRemember that the styling and customization options are vast, and you can use any combination of CSS, Javascript, and Isotope's API to create uniquely styled and interactive layouts.  Experimentation is key to discovering the best approach for your particular application.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\nThis section covers advanced techniques for using Isotope effectively, including integration with other libraries, handling large datasets, and optimizing performance.\n\n### Integrating with Other JavaScript Libraries\n\nIsotope is designed to work well with other JavaScript libraries.  Its jQuery dependency makes integration straightforward.  Common integrations include:\n\n* **jQuery UI:**  Isotope's filtering and sorting functionality can be combined with jQuery UI widgets like draggable and droppable for creating interactive layouts.\n\n* **Other UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular):**  While Isotope itself is a jQuery plugin, you can integrate it into modern frameworks using techniques like wrapping Isotope within a component or using a library to bridge jQuery and the framework's DOM manipulation methods.\n\n\n* **Image loading libraries (LazySizes, etc.):**  Combine Isotope with lazy-loading libraries to improve page load times when dealing with many images.  This is especially important for large image galleries.\n\n* **Infinite scrolling libraries:**  Enhance the user experience by integrating infinite scrolling to fetch and display more items as the user scrolls down, thereby avoiding loading all items at once.\n\n\nRemember to carefully manage the order of script inclusion to ensure proper library dependencies.  Always include jQuery before Isotope, and other libraries as needed, ensuring any framework-specific integration handles potential conflicts.\n\n\n### Using Isotope with Different Data Sources (JSON)\n\nIsotope primarily works with items that already exist in the DOM.  However, you can fetch data from various sources (like JSON APIs) and dynamically create the HTML elements for Isotope.\n\n\n```javascript\n$.getJSON('data.json', function(data) {\n  var $grid = $('#isotope-container');\n  $.each(data, function(index, item) {\n    var $item = $('<div class=\"item\" data-category=\"' + item.category + '\">' + item.title + '</div>');\n    $grid.append($item);\n  });\n  $grid.isotope({\n    itemSelector: '.item',\n    // ... other Isotope options\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis code fetches JSON data, creates HTML elements for each item, appends them to the container, and then initializes Isotope. Ensure that your data includes attributes that Isotope will use for filtering or sorting (if needed).  Error handling (e.g., if the JSON fetch fails) is crucial for robust applications.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Layout Modes\n\nIsotope allows creating custom layout modes to handle unique arrangement requirements.  This involves creating a JavaScript class that extends Isotope's `LayoutMode` class and implementing its methods (`_resetLayout`, `_getItemLayoutPosition`, `_getContainerSize`, etc.).  The Isotope documentation provides detailed instructions on this advanced feature.  Custom layout modes allow for highly specialized visual designs tailored to your needs.\n\n### Handling Large Datasets\n\nWhen dealing with large datasets, optimizing performance is crucial.  Techniques include:\n\n* **Pagination:** Divide data into pages to reduce the initial load and render only the currently visible items.\n\n* **Virtualization:**  Only render the visible items; render additional items as the user scrolls or interacts with the layout.  Libraries designed for virtualized lists can be very beneficial here.\n\n* **Asynchronous loading:** Load data in chunks or dynamically as needed instead of loading everything at once.\n\n* **Efficient selectors:** Use specific and efficient CSS selectors in your `itemSelector` to avoid unnecessary DOM traversal.\n\n* **Debouncing/throttling:**  Avoid excessive layout recalculations by debouncing or throttling events that trigger layout updates (e.g., window resize events).\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nPerformance optimization for Isotope involves several strategies:\n\n* **Minimize DOM manipulations:**  Avoid frequent additions or removals of items unless absolutely necessary.  Batch updates when possible.\n\n* **Efficient selectors:**  Use well-defined, specific CSS selectors for optimal performance.\n\n* **Layout optimization:**  Choose the layout mode most suitable for your data and visual requirements.  Avoid unnecessarily complex layouts.\n\n* **Use of `layoutItems()`:** For targeted updates (adding, removing, or updating a few items),  `layoutItems()` is much more efficient than `layout()` or `arrange()`, as it only repositions the affected items, rather than all.\n\n\n* **Image optimization:**  Optimize images (size and format) to minimize load times.  Lazy loading of images can also significantly help.\n\n\n### Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues and debugging strategies:\n\n* **Layout problems:** Check the container's size, item dimensions, and CSS styles. Ensure that items are correctly measured and positioned.  Inspect the rendered HTML and CSS in your browser's developer tools to identify layout inconsistencies.\n\n* **Filtering/sorting issues:** Verify your filter selectors and sorting data.  Use the browser's developer tools to debug your JavaScript code and inspect the data being used by Isotope.\n\n* **Performance issues:**  Profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks.  Use your browser's developer tools to check for excessive reflows and repaints.  Consider optimizations for large datasets and avoid unnecessary layout recalculations.\n\n* **Conflicts with other libraries:**  Carefully check for conflicts between Isotope and other JavaScript libraries.  Manage the order of script inclusion carefully.  Consult the Isotope documentation and other library documentations to prevent conflicting usage of methods, selectors, or other resources.\n\n\nBy following these advanced techniques and best practices, you can create efficient, performant, and visually appealing Isotope layouts capable of handling large amounts of data and seamlessly integrating with other parts of your applications.  Remember to consult the Isotope documentation for up-to-date information and best practices.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a detailed reference for Isotope's API, including the constructor, methods, events, and options.  Refer to the official Isotope documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive API details.\n\n\n### Isotope Constructor\n\nThe Isotope constructor initializes the Isotope layout on a given container element.  It takes a single argument: an options object.  This object configures various aspects of the Isotope layout.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Basic initialization\nvar $grid = $('#container').isotope({\n  itemSelector: '.item', // Required option: selector for items within the container\n  layoutMode: 'masonry' // Optional option: default layout mode\n});\n```\n\nThe `itemSelector` is required; it specifies the CSS selector to identify individual items within the container.  Other options (like `layoutMode`) are optional and provide more customization.\n\n\n### Methods\n\nIsotope offers several methods to interact with and manipulate the layout.  Many methods can be chained together for more complex operations.  These method calls return the Isotope instance which allows chaining.\n\n* **`layout()` or `arrange()`:**  Re-layouts all items in the container.  Useful after adding, removing, or updating items.  `arrange()` may provide slight performance benefits in certain situations.\n\n* **`filter(selector)`:**  Filters the items based on the provided CSS selector.  Only items matching the selector will be visible.\n\n* **`sort(options)`:**  Sorts the items based on the options provided in an object (usually including `sortBy` and `getSortData`).\n\n* **`appended(elems)`:** Adds new elements to the layout.  `elems` is a jQuery collection of the elements to add.\n\n* **`prepended(elems)`:**  Similar to `appended()`, but adds elements to the beginning of the layout.\n\n* **`remove(elems)`:** Removes elements from the layout. `elems` is a jQuery collection of the elements to remove.\n\n* **`layoutItems(elems, isLayoutInstant)`:** Relays out only the specified elements (`elems`), improving performance over a full `layout()` when only some items need repositioning.  `isLayoutInstant` (optional, defaults to `false`) will avoid animation.\n\n* **`destroy()`:**  Completely removes Isotope from the container, restoring the original HTML structure and removing event handlers.\n\n* **`getItemElements()`:** Returns a jQuery collection of all item elements.\n\n* **`getFilteredItemElements()`:** Returns a jQuery collection of only the currently visible (filtered) item elements.\n\n\n\n### Events\n\nIsotope triggers several events during different stages of its operation.  You can use these events to perform actions based on layout changes, filter updates, or sorting operations.\n\n\n* **`layoutComplete`:** Triggered after the layout is complete.  Useful for executing actions that depend on the final item positions.\n\n* **`arrangeComplete`:** Similar to `layoutComplete`, triggered after the items are arranged.  Generally interchangeable, but `arrangeComplete` is more descriptive when specifically triggered by methods like `filter()` and `sort()`.\n\n* **`arrangeStart`:** Triggered at the beginning of an arrangement.  Useful for providing a loading indicator or pausing other processes until the layout is complete.\n\n* **`updateLayout`:** Triggered whenever the layout starts recalculating.  This event can be used for UI feedback, such as showing a loading indicator while the layout is being updated.\n\n* **`filterComplete`:**  Triggered after filtering is complete.\n\n\nExample of using an event:\n\n\n```javascript\n$grid.on( 'layoutComplete', function( event, filteredItems ) {\n  console.log( 'Layout complete. Number of visible items:', filteredItems.length );\n});\n```\n\n\n### Options\n\nThe Isotope constructor accepts an options object with various properties to configure the layout's behavior.  The most commonly used options include:\n\n\n* **`itemSelector` (required):** CSS selector for identifying items within the container.\n\n* **`layoutMode` (optional):**  Specifies the layout mode ('masonry', 'fitRows', 'fitColumns', 'cellsByRow', 'cellsByColumn', 'straightDown', etc.).  Defaults to 'masonry'.\n\n* **`percentPosition` (optional, boolean):**  Allows positioning items using percentages instead of pixels.  Useful for responsive layouts.  Defaults to `false`.\n\n* **`transitionDuration` (optional, string):**  Specifies the duration of the CSS transition for item movements.\n\n* **`stagger` (optional, number):**  Adds a delay between item animations to create a staggered effect.\n\n* **`getSortData` (optional, object):**  Defines how to extract sort data from items.  Used in conjunction with `sortBy`.\n\n* **`sortBy` (optional, string or array):**  Specifies the attribute(s) to sort items by.\n\n* **`sortAscending` (optional, boolean):**  Determines the sorting order (ascending or descending).  Defaults to `true` (ascending).\n\n\n* **`filter` (optional, string or function):**  Sets an initial filter for the layout upon initialization.\n\n\nRemember to consult the official Isotope documentation for a comprehensive list of options and their descriptions.  The availability of and necessity for each option will depend on the complexity and requirements of your layout.\n\n\nThis API reference provides a foundational understanding.  Thoroughly reviewing the complete Isotope documentation is recommended for advanced usage and addressing specific scenarios.\n\n\n## Developer Manual: Isotope\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nIsotope's flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. This section explores several common use cases and provides guidance on implementing them effectively.\n\n\n### Image Gallery\n\nIsotope excels at creating responsive and dynamic image galleries.  Items can be images of varying sizes, each potentially linked to a larger version or detailed information.  Filtering can be implemented to allow users to browse images by category, tag, or other criteria.\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"image-gallery\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item nature\"><img src=\"nature1.jpg\" alt=\"Nature 1\"></div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item portrait\"><img src=\"portrait1.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait 1\"></div>\n  <!-- ... more images ... -->\n</div>\n<button data-filter=\"*\">Show All</button>\n<button data-filter=\".nature\">Nature</button>\n<button data-filter=\".portrait\">Portrait</button>\n```\n\nJavaScript would then initialize Isotope and handle filtering based on button clicks.  Consider using lazy loading for improved performance if you have many images.\n\n\n### Portfolio Showcase\n\nIsotope is ideal for presenting a portfolio of work.  Each item can represent a project, with an image, title, and brief description.  Filtering allows users to view projects by category (e.g., web design, graphic design, photography).  Sorting could provide options to view projects by date, client, or other criteria.\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"portfolio\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item web-design\">Project 1</div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item graphic-design\">Project 2</div>\n  <!-- ... more projects ... -->\n</div>\n<button data-filter=\"*\">Show All</button>\n<button data-filter=\".web-design\">Web Design</button>\n<button data-filter=\".graphic-design\">Graphic Design</button>\n```\n\nThe Javascript would handle the initialization of Isotope and the filtering.  Consider adding more details like project descriptions and links on hover or click.\n\n\n### Product Catalog\n\nIsotope can create an interactive product catalog.  Each item represents a product, displaying an image, name, price, and perhaps a short description.  Filtering allows users to browse products by category, price range, or features.  Sorting could order products by price, popularity, or newness.\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"product-catalog\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item electronics\" data-price=\"199\">Product A</div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item clothing\" data-price=\"49\">Product B</div>\n  <!-- ... more products ... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThe Javascript would manage filtering by category and price range, and sorting by price (ascending or descending).  Consider adding pagination for larger catalogs.\n\n\n### Blog Archive\n\nIsotope can organize a blog archive, displaying blog posts in a visually appealing layout.  Each item represents a blog post, displaying a title, image, short excerpt, and link to the full post.  Filtering could categorize posts by topic or tag.  Sorting might allow users to view posts by date (newest or oldest).\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"blog-archive\" class=\"isotope\">\n  <div class=\"grid-item technology\">Blog Post 1</div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item travel\">Blog Post 2</div>\n  <!-- ... more blog posts ... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThe Javascript would handle the filtering and sorting, potentially allowing users to view posts by date (newest first, oldest first).\n\n\n### Dynamic Content Updates\n\nIsotope shines in applications involving dynamic content updates.  New items can be added or existing items can be modified (e.g., changing product prices or adding new blog posts) without requiring a full page reload.  Isotope's methods (`appended`, `prepended`, `remove`, `layout`) are essential for maintaining a fluid and responsive user experience.\n\n\nFor all examples, remember to include appropriate CSS for styling the container and items.  Proper image optimization and lazy loading are also crucial for performance, especially with image-heavy layouts. The specific Javascript code will depend on the chosen filtering and sorting implementation.  Consider using data attributes for storing filtering and sorting information (e.g., `data-category`, `data-price`, `data-date`).  These examples demonstrate the adaptability of Isotope across various content types.\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
