It abstracts away the complexities of dealing with different browser APIs and device features, offering a simplified interface for developers to retrieve data such as screen size, device orientation, battery level (where available), network connectivity, and more.  It aims to improve developer productivity and ensure consistent functionality across a wide range of devices and browsers.\n\n\n### Key Features and Benefits\n\n* **Cross-platform compatibility:** Works seamlessly across various devices and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), minimizing the need for platform-specific code.\n* **Simplified API:** Provides a clean and intuitive JavaScript API for accessing device information.\n* **Lightweight and efficient:**  Minimal impact on application performance due to its small size and optimized code.\n* **Easy integration:** Simple installation process and straightforward integration into existing web projects.\n* **Comprehensive device information:** Access to a broad range of device capabilities, from basic screen dimensions to more advanced features (where supported by the device and browser).\n* **Open-source and community-driven:**  Benefits from community contributions and ongoing development.\n\n\n### Target Audience\n\nDevice.js is primarily intended for web developers building responsive and cross-platform web applications.  This includes front-end developers, mobile web developers, and anyone creating web applications that need to adapt to different devices and screen sizes.  It's particularly useful for developers who want to avoid writing extensive platform-specific code to handle device detection and feature access.\n\n\n### Setting up the Development Environment\n\nTo develop using Device.js, you will need a standard web development environment. This includes:\n\n* **A code editor:**  VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or any other text editor you prefer.\n* **A web browser:**  Modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge are recommended for testing.\n* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):**  Needed for the installation process (described in the next section).  Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed and added to your system's PATH.  You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).  Yarn is an alternative package manager you can use instead of npm.\n\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\nDevice.js is distributed via npm. To install it, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install device.js\n```\n\nAlternatively, using yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn add device.js\n```\n\nAfter successful installation, you can include Device.js in your project using a `<script>` tag in your HTML file (if not using a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"node_modules/device.js/dist/device.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOr, if you are using a module bundler, you can import it directly into your JavaScript files:\n\n```javascript\nimport Device from 'device.js';\n\n//Now you can use the Device object. See the API documentation for details.\nconst deviceInfo = Device();\nconsole.log(deviceInfo);\n```\n\nRemember to consult the API documentation for detailed information on how to use the library and access specific device features.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Device Detection and Capabilities\n\nDevice.js employs a combination of browser APIs and heuristics to detect device characteristics and capabilities. It aims to provide a consistent and reliable way to access information regardless of the underlying platform or browser.  The library identifies key properties such as:\n\n* **Screen size and resolution:**  Provides the width and height of the screen, as well as pixel density (DPI).\n* **Device type:** Attempts to classify the device as a desktop, mobile phone, tablet, or other category.  This classification is based on user agent and screen size information, and may not be perfectly accurate in all cases.\n* **Operating system:** Identifies the operating system (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows, macOS).\n* **Browser:** Detects the web browser being used (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n* **Orientation:**  Determines whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.\n* **Network connectivity:** Checks for network availability and connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular).  (Note: This may require additional permissions or browser support).\n* **Battery status:**  (Where supported by the browser and device) provides information about battery level and charging status.\n\n\nThe specific capabilities reported will depend on the browser's support for various APIs and the features available on the device itself.\n\n\n### Event Handling and Listeners\n\nDevice.js doesn't directly offer a comprehensive event handling system for device changes (such as orientation changes).  Instead, it relies on standard browser events.  For example, to handle orientation changes, you would typically use the browser's built-in `window.onorientationchange` event.  Device.js focuses on providing the device information, leaving the event handling to the standard browser mechanisms.  This approach ensures consistency across browsers and avoids introducing an additional event system.\n\n\n### Data Management and Storage\n\nDevice.js primarily focuses on retrieving device information and does not directly handle data management or storage.   Persistent data storage (e.g., saving device preferences) would require utilizing browser storage mechanisms like `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or other appropriate methods depending on your application's requirements.  Device.js is not involved in the actual storage of this data, but the device information retrieved using the library could inform how your data management strategy is implemented.\n\n\n### API Integration and Communication\n\nDevice.js itself does not include direct API integration capabilities.  It's intended to provide the device context.   If your application needs to interact with external APIs (e.g., a server-side API), you will need to use standard JavaScript `fetch` calls, AJAX, or other relevant methods to make those communications.  The device information obtained from Device.js may be included in requests to external APIs to provide context or personalize the response.  For example, you might send the device's screen size to the server to tailor the response appropriately.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n**Note:** The following API descriptions are illustrative and may not represent a real implementation of Device.js.  A real library would have specific methods and return types clearly documented.  This section provides a conceptual overview.  Always consult the actual library documentation for the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n\n\n### Device Information API\n\nThis API provides basic information about the device.\n\n* `Device.getInfo(): Object` – Returns an object containing general device information such as device type (`desktop`, `mobile`, `tablet`), operating system (`iOS`, `Android`, `Windows`, etc.), browser, screen dimensions (width, height, pixel density), and user agent.\n\n```javascript\nconst deviceInfo = Device.getInfo();\nconsole.log(deviceInfo.deviceType); //e.g., \"mobile\"\nconsole.log(deviceInfo.screen.width); //e.g., 375\n```\n\n\n### Network Information API\n\nProvides information about the network connection.  (Note:  Requires appropriate browser permissions and may not be supported on all platforms).\n\n* `Device.getNetworkStatus(): Object` – Returns an object with details about the network connection, including connection type (`wifi`, `cellular`, `ethernet`, `offline`), IP address, and signal strength (where available).\n\n```javascript\nconst networkStatus = Device.getNetworkStatus();\nconsole.log(networkStatus.connectionType); //e.g., \"wifi\"\n```\n\n\n### Storage API\n\n(This section is placeholder; Device.js likely won't directly manage storage.  It would rely on browser APIs.)\n\nThis section would describe how to use browser's `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` if the library provided helper functions for interacting with them.\n\n\n### Orientation API\n\nProvides information about device orientation.\n\n* `Device.getOrientation(): String` – Returns the current orientation: `\"portrait\"` or `\"landscape\"`.\n* `Device.onOrientationChange(callback: Function)` – Registers a callback function that is executed whenever the device orientation changes.\n\n```javascript\nDevice.onOrientationChange(orientation => {\n  console.log(`Orientation changed to: ${orientation}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n### Geolocation API\n\n(This section is placeholder; Device.js would likely use the browser's Geolocation API)\nThis section would show how to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates if the library provided helpful wrappers around the Geolocation API.  Permission handling would be described.\n\n\n### Battery Status API\n\n(Note:  Browser support and device capabilities are critical; this may not always be available).\n\n* `Device.getBatteryStatus(): Object` –  Returns an object containing battery level (percentage), charging status (`charging` or `discharging`), and possibly other relevant information.\n\n```javascript\nconst batteryStatus = Device.getBatteryStatus();\nconsole.log(`Battery level: ${batteryStatus.level}%`);\n```\n\n\n### Connectivity API\n\nThis API may overlap with the Network Information API, providing additional details about connection strength and types.\n\n\n### Sensors API\n\n(This section is a placeholder; Device.js may not directly manage sensors.)  This section would describe usage of browser APIs for accessing device sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, etc. if the library provided helper functions.\n\n\n### Camera API\n\n(This section is a placeholder; Device.js would likely not directly manage camera access).  This section would explain how to use the browser's MediaDevices API to access the device's camera if the library offered a simplified wrapper.\n\n\n### Media API\n\n(This section is a placeholder; Device.js would likely not directly manage media playback.) This section would explain how to use the browser's Media APIs (for audio and video) if Device.js offered helpful wrapper functions.\n\n\n### User Interface API\n\n(This section is a placeholder;  Device.js is unlikely to directly provide UI elements.)  This would describe any UI-related helper functions the library might provide for adapting to different screen sizes or device types.\n\n\nRemember that the actual API methods, parameters, and return values would be detailed in the official Device.js documentation.  This is a skeletal representation for illustrative purposes.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Device Detection Logic\n\nWhile Device.js provides default device detection,  advanced users might need to customize this logic.  This could involve scenarios where the default detection isn't accurate enough for a specific application or where the library needs to consider additional factors.  (Note:  The exact mechanism for customization would depend on the library's implementation; this is a general description).  A hypothetical example might be:\n\n```javascript\n// Hypothetical customization: adding a custom device type based on user agent string\nDevice.addDeviceTypeCheck(userAgent => {\n  if (userAgent.includes(\"MyCustomBrowser\")) {\n    return \"customBrowser\";\n  }\n  return null; // Let default detection handle it\n});\n```\n\nThis would require extending the library's internal detection process.  Care must be taken not to break the library's existing functionality.  Consult the library's source code and documentation for specifics on extending or modifying its detection rules.\n\n\n### Building Hybrid Applications\n\nDevice.js can be used in hybrid mobile applications built with frameworks like Cordova, Ionic, or React Native.  The integration process would involve including the Device.js library within the hybrid app's web view.  The specific approach will vary depending on the chosen framework.  Generally, you'll need to ensure the library is accessible within your JavaScript code running inside the web view.\n\n\n### Integrating with Third-Party Libraries\n\nDevice.js can work alongside other JavaScript libraries.   For example, you might use it to gather device information that's then used by a mapping library or a charting library to optimize display or functionality based on screen size or device capabilities.   The integration is generally straightforward: Include Device.js and the other library in your project and use their respective APIs within your application code.  No special configurations are typically required unless conflicts in dependencies arise.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization Techniques\n\nBecause Device.js is a lightweight library, performance issues are typically not a major concern.  However, if you are performing intensive operations based on device information, consider optimizing:\n\n* **Caching:**  Cache device information if it's not expected to change frequently to avoid repeated calls to `Device.getInfo()`.\n* **Asynchronous operations:**  Use asynchronous operations (promises or async/await) when retrieving device information to avoid blocking the main thread.\n* **Avoid unnecessary calls:**  Only call Device.js APIs when the information is actually needed.\n\n\n### Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues, standard JavaScript debugging techniques apply.  Use your browser's developer tools (console, debugger) to inspect the values returned by Device.js functions and check for errors.  Inspect the network requests (if making API calls) to identify any communication problems. Carefully review the console logs for errors or warnings from the library.\n\n\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n* **Data Privacy:**  Be mindful of the device information you access and how it's used.  Obtain necessary user consent if accessing sensitive data (e.g., geolocation).  Avoid storing sensitive device data without proper encryption and security measures.\n* **Permissions:**  Ensure that you handle browser permissions appropriately (e.g., for geolocation or access to certain sensors).  Inform the user why your app needs these permissions and how the data will be used.\n* **Input Validation:**  If user input is used to filter or modify device information, always validate this input to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n\n\n## Examples and Tutorials\n\n**Note:** The code examples below are illustrative and assume a functional Device.js library with the APIs described previously.  Replace these examples with actual code from your library's documentation.\n\n\n### Basic Device Information Retrieval\n\nThis example shows how to retrieve basic device information using Device.js:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport Device from 'device.js'; // Or include via <script> tag if not using a module bundler\n\nconst deviceInfo = Device.getInfo();\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Type:\", deviceInfo.deviceType);\nconsole.log(\"Operating System:\", deviceInfo.os);\nconsole.log(\"Browser:\", deviceInfo.browser);\nconsole.log(\"Screen Width:\", deviceInfo.screen.width);\nconsole.log(\"Screen Height:\", deviceInfo.screen.height);\n```\n\n\n### Handling Orientation Changes\n\nThis example demonstrates how to handle orientation changes using the browser's built-in event listener (Device.js doesn't directly manage this):\n\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('orientationchange', () => {\n  const orientation = window.orientation;\n  let orientationString;\n  if (orientation === 0 || orientation === 180) {\n    orientationString = 'portrait';\n  } else {\n    orientationString = 'landscape';\n  }\n  console.log(`Orientation changed to: ${orientationString}`);\n  // Update UI or application logic based on orientation\n});\n```\n\n### Using Geolocation to Get User Location\n\nThis example uses the browser's Geolocation API (Device.js likely won't directly handle this; it's a browser feature).  Remember to handle permission requests appropriately:\n\n```javascript\nif (navigator.geolocation) {\n  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {\n    console.log(\"Latitude:\", position.coords.latitude);\n    console.log(\"Longitude:\", position.coords.longitude);\n  }, error => {\n    console.error(\"Error getting location:\", error);\n  });\n} else {\n  console.error(\"Geolocation is not supported by this browser.\");\n}\n```\n\n\n### Accessing Device Sensors\n\nThis is a placeholder; accessing device sensors requires the browser's Sensor API, and Device.js likely wouldn't directly manage this. A hypothetical example showing how the library *might* simplify access:\n\n```javascript\n// Hypothetical example -  check Device.js documentation for actual implementation.\nif (Device.hasSensor('accelerometer')) {\n  const accelerometerData = Device.getSensorData('accelerometer');\n  console.log(\"Accelerometer data:\", accelerometerData);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Building a Simple Mobile Application\n\nThis section would contain a more substantial example demonstrating a complete mobile application using Device.js to adapt its UI or behavior to different devices. This would likely include multiple code snippets showing how to retrieve device information and use it to make decisions in the app's logic.  (A full example is too extensive for this response).\n\n\n### Advanced Use Case Examples\n\nThis section would provide examples demonstrating more complex use cases:\n\n* **Dynamic UI Adaptation:**  Show how to use device information (screen size, device type) to create a responsive UI that adapts to different devices.\n* **Personalized User Experience:** Use device information to tailor the user experience, for example, by adjusting font sizes or loading different images based on screen resolution or device type.\n* **Context-Aware Applications:** Create applications that use device information (like geolocation or network status) to change behavior based on user context.  For instance, a weather application might load location-specific weather data based on geolocation information.\n\nRemember to refer to the official Device.js documentation for complete and accurate examples using the library's specific API.  These examples are for illustrative purposes only.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Support\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **\"Device.js not defined\":** This error usually means the library hasn't been included correctly in your project. Double-check that you've correctly installed it using npm or yarn and that you've included the script tag in your HTML (or imported it correctly if using a module bundler).  Ensure the path to the library file is accurate.\n\n* **Incorrect Device Information:** If the device information reported by Device.js is inaccurate, this could be due to limitations in browser APIs or inconsistencies in user agent strings.  Check the browser's developer console for any errors.  Consider if the user's browser or device might have unusual settings that interfere with detection.  The accuracy of some information (like device type classification) is inherently approximate.\n\n* **Permission Errors (Geolocation, Sensors):** If accessing features like geolocation or sensors, ensure you've handled permission requests properly and that the user has granted the necessary permissions.  Check the browser's console for permission-related error messages.\n\n* **Compatibility Issues:**  Ensure your code is compatible with the browsers and devices you intend to support.  Device.js itself aims for cross-browser compatibility, but the underlying APIs it relies on may have varying levels of support across different platforms.\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n* **Q: What browsers are supported?**  A: Device.js aims for broad browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). However, the availability of certain features (like battery status or specific sensors) may depend on the browser and device capabilities.  Check the browser's compatibility with the underlying APIs Device.js uses.\n\n* **Q: How lightweight is Device.js?** A:  Device.js is designed to be lightweight, minimizing the impact on application performance. The exact size will vary depending on the version and features included. Check the library's distribution files for size information.\n\n* **Q: Can I contribute to the project?**  A:  If the project is open source, contribution guidelines will typically be available on its repository (e.g., on GitHub).  Look for a CONTRIBUTING.md file or similar.\n\n* **Q: How do I report a bug?**  A: Follow the instructions in the \"Reporting Bugs and Issues\" section below.\n\n\n### Community Support\n\nFor community support and discussions related to Device.js, check if the project has a dedicated forum, community chat (e.g., Discord), or issue tracker on platforms like GitHub.  Active communities can be great resources for troubleshooting and finding solutions to common problems.\n\n\n### Reporting Bugs and Issues\n\nTo report bugs or issues, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check existing issues:** Before creating a new issue, search the issue tracker (if available) to see if the problem has already been reported.\n\n2. **Provide clear and concise information:** When submitting a new issue, include the following:\n    * **Device.js version:** Specify the version of the library you are using.\n    * **Browser and OS:**  Provide the browser (and version) and operating system you're encountering the issue on.\n    * **Detailed description:** Give a clear and concise description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it.\n    * **Error messages:**  If any error messages are displayed, include them exactly as they appear.\n    * **Code snippet:**  Include a minimal code snippet that demonstrates the problem.\n    * **Expected behavior:** Describe what you expect to happen.\n    * **Actual behavior:** Describe what actually happens.\n\n3. **Follow any guidelines:**  The project's issue tracker or documentation may have specific guidelines on how to report bugs.

However, if you are performing intensive operations based on device information, consider optimizing:\n\n* **Caching:**  Cache device information if it's not expected to change frequently to avoid repeated calls to `Device.getInfo()`.\n* **Asynchronous operations:**  Use asynchronous operations (promises or async/await) when retrieving device information to avoid blocking the main thread.\n* **Avoid unnecessary calls:**  Only call Device.js APIs when the information is actually needed.\n\n\n### Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues, standard JavaScript debugging techniques apply.  Use your browser's developer tools (console, debugger) to inspect the values returned by Device.js functions and check for errors.  Inspect the network requests (if making API calls) to identify any communication problems. Carefully review the console logs for errors or warnings from the library.\n\n\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n* **Data Privacy:**  Be mindful of the device information you access and how it's used.  Obtain necessary user consent if accessing sensitive data (e.g., geolocation).  Avoid storing sensitive device data without proper encryption and security measures.\n* **Permissions:**  Ensure that you handle browser permissions appropriately (e.g., for geolocation or access to certain sensors).  Inform the user why your app needs these permissions and how the data will be used.\n* **Input Validation:**  If user input is used to filter or modify device information, always validate this input to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n\n\n## Examples and Tutorials\n\n**Note:** The code examples below are illustrative and assume a functional Device.js library with the APIs described previously.  Replace these examples with actual code from your library's documentation.\n\n\n### Basic Device Information Retrieval\n\nThis example shows how to retrieve basic device information using Device.js:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport Device from 'device.js'; // Or include via <script> tag if not using a module bundler\n\nconst deviceInfo = Device.getInfo();\n\nconsole.log(\"Device Type:\", deviceInfo.deviceType);\nconsole.log(\"Operating System:\", deviceInfo.os);\nconsole.log(\"Browser:\", deviceInfo.browser);\nconsole.log(\"Screen Width:\", deviceInfo.screen.width);\nconsole.log(\"Screen Height:\", deviceInfo.screen.height);\n```\n\n\n### Handling Orientation Changes\n\nThis example demonstrates how to handle orientation changes using the browser's built-in event listener (Device.js doesn't directly manage this):\n\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('orientationchange', () => {\n  const orientation = window.orientation;\n  let orientationString;\n  if (orientation === 0 || orientation === 180) {\n    orientationString = 'portrait';\n  } else {\n    orientationString = 'landscape';\n  }\n  console.log(`Orientation changed to: ${orientationString}`);\n  // Update UI or application logic based on orientation\n});\n```\n\n### Using Geolocation to Get User Location\n\nThis example uses the browser's Geolocation API (Device.js likely won't directly handle this; it's a browser feature).  Remember to handle permission requests appropriately:\n\n```javascript\nif (navigator.geolocation) {\n  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {\n    console.log(\"Latitude:\", position.coords.latitude);\n    console.log(\"Longitude:\", position.coords.longitude);\n  }, error => {\n    console.error(\"Error getting location:\", error);\n  });\n} else {\n  console.error(\"Geolocation is not supported by this browser.\");\n}\n```\n\n\n### Accessing Device Sensors\n\nThis is a placeholder; accessing device sensors requires the browser's Sensor API, and Device.js likely wouldn't directly manage this. A hypothetical example showing how the library *might* simplify access:\n\n```javascript\n// Hypothetical example -  check Device.js documentation for actual implementation.\nif (Device.hasSensor('accelerometer')) {\n  const accelerometerData = Device.getSensorData('accelerometer');\n  console.log(\"Accelerometer data:\", accelerometerData);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Building a Simple Mobile Application\n\nThis section would contain a more substantial example demonstrating a complete mobile application using Device.js to adapt its UI or behavior to different devices. This would likely include multiple code snippets showing how to retrieve device information and use it to make decisions in the app's logic.  (A full example is too extensive for this response).\n\n\n### Advanced Use Case Examples\n\nThis section would provide examples demonstrating more complex use cases:\n\n* **Dynamic UI Adaptation:**  Show how to use device information (screen size, device type) to create a responsive UI that adapts to different devices.\n* **Personalized User Experience:** Use device information to tailor the user experience, for example, by adjusting font sizes or loading different images based on screen resolution or device type.\n* **Context-Aware Applications:** Create applications that use device information (like geolocation or network status) to change behavior based on user context.  For instance, a weather application might load location-specific weather data based on geolocation information.\n\nRemember to refer to the official Device.js documentation for complete and accurate examples using the library's specific API.  These examples are for illustrative purposes only.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Support\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **\"Device.js not defined\":** This error usually means the library hasn't been included correctly in your project. Double-check that you've correctly installed it using npm or yarn and that you've included the script tag in your HTML (or imported it correctly if using a module bundler).  Ensure the path to the library file is accurate.\n\n* **Incorrect Device Information:** If the device information reported by Device.js is inaccurate, this could be due to limitations in browser APIs or inconsistencies in user agent strings.  Check the browser's developer console for any errors.  Consider if the user's browser or device might have unusual settings that interfere with detection.  The accuracy of some information (like device type classification) is inherently approximate.\n\n* **Permission Errors (Geolocation, Sensors):** If accessing features like geolocation or sensors, ensure you've handled permission requests properly and that the user has granted the necessary permissions.  Check the browser's console for permission-related error messages.\n\n* **Compatibility Issues:**  Ensure your code is compatible with the browsers and devices you intend to support.  Device.js itself aims for cross-browser compatibility, but the underlying APIs it relies on may have varying levels of support across different platforms.\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n* **Q: What browsers are supported?**  A: Device.js aims for broad browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). However, the availability of certain features (like battery status or specific sensors) may depend on the browser and device capabilities.  Check the browser's compatibility with the underlying APIs Device.js uses.\n\n* **Q: How lightweight is Device.js?** A:  Device.js is designed to be lightweight, minimizing the impact on application performance. The exact size will vary depending on the version and features included. Check the library's distribution files for size information.\n\n* **Q: Can I contribute to the project?**  A:  If the project is open source, contribution guidelines will typically be available on its repository (e.g., on GitHub).  Look for a CONTRIBUTING.md file or similar.\n\n* **Q: How do I report a bug?**  A: Follow the instructions in the \"Reporting Bugs and Issues\" section below.\n\n\n### Community Support\n\nFor community support and discussions related to Device.js, check if the project has a dedicated forum, community chat (e.g., Discord), or issue tracker on platforms like GitHub.  Active communities can be great resources for troubleshooting and finding solutions to common problems.\n\n\n### Reporting Bugs and Issues\n\nTo report bugs or issues, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check existing issues:** Before creating a new issue, search the issue tracker (if available) to see if the problem has already been reported.\n\n2. **Provide clear and concise information:** When submitting a new issue, include the following:\n    * **Device.js version:** Specify the version of the library you are using.\n    * **Browser and OS:**  Provide the browser (and version) and operating system you're encountering the issue on.\n    * **Detailed description:** Give a clear and concise description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it.\n    * **Error messages:**  If any error messages are displayed, include them exactly as they appear.\n    * **Code snippet:**  Include a minimal code snippet that demonstrates the problem.\n    * **Expected behavior:** Describe what you expect to happen.\n    * **Actual behavior:** Describe what actually happens.\n\n3. **Follow any guidelines:**  The project's issue tracker or documentation may have specific guidelines on how to report bugs.
