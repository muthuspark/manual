Extract the contents to your project directory.  You'll find the necessary CSS and JavaScript files within.\n\n* **CDN:** Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to include FlexSlider.  This avoids the need to host the files yourself and can improve loading times for users in different geographical locations.  Many popular CDNs offer FlexSlider.  Be sure to check their specific inclusion instructions.\n\n* **NPM:** If you use Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), you can install FlexSlider via the command line: `npm install flexslider`\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nAfter installing FlexSlider, the basic usage involves including the necessary CSS and JavaScript files (detailed below), and then adding the appropriate markup to your HTML (also detailed below).  The core functionality of FlexSlider is automatically enabled upon page load once properly configured. You'll then only need to potentially customize settings to tailor the slider to your specific design requirements via the plugin's options.\n\n\n### Including CSS and JavaScript\n\nInclude the following files in your HTML document's `<head>` section:\n\n* **CSS:**  `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">` (replace `\"flexslider.css\"` with the actual path to the stylesheet).\n\n* **JavaScript:** `<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>` (You need jQuery. Ensure the path is correct).  Then include the FlexSlider JavaScript file: `<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>` (replace with the correct path).\n\n\nIt's crucial to include jQuery *before* the FlexSlider JavaScript file.  jQuery is a dependency for FlexSlider to function correctly.\n\n\n### Markup Requirements\n\nFlexSlider requires a specific HTML structure to work.  The basic markup consists of an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing list items (`<li>`) representing the slider images or content. Each `<li>` should contain the content to be displayed in the slider.  An example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li>\n      <img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\">\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\">\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\">\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\nTo initialize the slider, you'll typically use jQuery like so (placing it after including the FlexSlider JavaScript):\n\n```javascript\n$(window).load(function() {\n  $('.flexslider').flexslider();\n});\n```\n\nThis line of code selects all elements with the class `flexslider` and initializes FlexSlider on them.  The `$(window).load()` ensures the images have fully loaded before the slider initializes, preventing issues with image dimensions. Remember to replace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.  The `.slides` class is crucial for FlexSlider to identify the slider content.\n\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nFlexSlider offers a wide array of configuration options to customize its behavior.  These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `flexslider()` function.\n\n### animation:\n\nType: String\nDefault: `fade`\n\nSpecifies the animation type used for transitions between slides.  Options include: `\"fade\"`, `\"slide\"`.\n\n\n### animationLoop:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nDetermines whether the slideshow loops continuously or stops after the last slide.  Set to `false` to disable looping.\n\n\n### autoHeight:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nAutomatically adjusts the slider's height to match the height of the current slide. Useful for slides with varying content heights.\n\n\n### controlsContainer:\n\nType: String\nDefault: `\"\"` (empty string)\n\nSpecifies a selector for a custom container to hold the navigation controls (prev/next buttons).  If left empty, the controls are appended to the slider container.\n\n\n### direction:\n\nType: String\nDefault: `horizontal`\n\nSets the slider's direction. Options are: `\"horizontal\"`, `\"vertical\"`.\n\n\n### directionNav:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nEnables or disables the previous/next navigation controls.\n\n\n### slideshow:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nStarts or stops the automatic slideshow.  Set to `false` to disable auto-advancing.\n\n\n### slideshowSpeed:\n\nType: Integer\nDefault: `7000` (milliseconds)\n\nSets the interval between auto-advancing slides (in milliseconds).\n\n\n### animationSpeed:\n\nType: Integer\nDefault: `600` (milliseconds)\n\nSets the speed of the animation transitions (in milliseconds).\n\n\n### pauseOnAction:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nPauses the slideshow when a user interacts with the slider (e.g., clicks a navigation control).\n\n\n### pauseOnHover:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nPauses the slideshow when the mouse hovers over the slider.\n\n\n### smoothHeight:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nEnables smooth height transitions between slides with varying heights.  This is often used in conjunction with `autoHeight`.\n\n\n### startAt:\n\nType: Integer\nDefault: `0`\n\nSpecifies the index of the slide to start on (0-based index).\n\n\n### randomStart:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nStarts the slideshow on a random slide.\n\n\n### before:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed *before* an animation begins.  The current slide index is passed as an argument.\n\n\n### after:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed *after* an animation completes.  The current slide index is passed as an argument.\n\n\n### start:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed when the slideshow starts.\n\n\n### end:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed when the slideshow ends (if `animationLoop` is `false`).\n\n\n### init:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed when the slider is initialized.\n\n\n### Customizing Navigation\n\nFlexSlider allows customization of navigation elements beyond simply enabling or disabling them (`directionNav`).  You can create custom navigation using HTML and JavaScript, then bind it to FlexSlider's API functions to control the slider's progression.  Refer to the advanced examples provided with the plugin for detailed instructions on this.\n\n\n### Using Callbacks\n\nThe `before`, `after`, `start`, `end`, and `init` callbacks provide opportunities to integrate custom functionality within the slider's lifecycle. For example, you could use the `before` callback to trigger an animation or update some element on the page before the slide transition, or use the `after` callback to perform actions after a slide transition is completed.  These callbacks are invaluable for integrating FlexSlider into complex applications.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\nThis section covers more advanced techniques and features of FlexSlider.\n\n### API Methods\n\nFlexSlider exposes several public methods allowing programmatic control over the slider.  These methods can be called on the FlexSlider object after initialization.\n\n\n### Public Methods\n\n* **`flexslider(options)`:** Initializes the slider.  `options` is a JavaScript object containing configuration settings.  This is also how you re-initialize the slider with different settings.\n\n* **`start()`:** Starts the slideshow.\n\n* **`stop()`:** Stops the slideshow.\n\n* **`play()`:**  (Alias for `start()`)\n\n* **`pause()`:** (Alias for `stop()`)\n\n* **`next()`:** Advances to the next slide.\n\n* **`prev()`:**  Advances to the previous slide.\n\n* **`goTo(index)`:**  Goes directly to the specified slide index (0-based index).\n\n* **`destroy()`:**  Completely removes FlexSlider from the element, restoring the original HTML.\n\n\n### Controlling Slides\n\nYou can use the public methods (`next()`, `prev()`, `goTo()`) to programmatically control the slider's progression.  This is useful for creating interactive elements that affect the slider.  For example, you could add buttons to explicitly move to the next or previous slides or create custom controls to jump to specific slides.  This would usually involve adding event handlers to custom buttons, calling the relevant FlexSlider method within the handler.\n\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nFlexSlider adapts to different screen sizes by default, maintaining responsiveness. However, you can further enhance its responsiveness by adjusting the configuration options and perhaps using CSS media queries to modify the slider's appearance for different screen sizes. Consider adjusting the slider's `itemWidth` or `itemMargin`  based on the viewport size (via media queries and JavaScript) to manage the spacing and layout of slides.\n\n\n### Custom Animations\n\nWhile FlexSlider offers \"fade\" and \"slide\" animations, you can create more custom animations by leveraging the `before` and `after` callbacks.  These callbacks allow you to execute JavaScript code before and after each slide transition.  Inside these callbacks, you can manipulate CSS properties or use other JavaScript animation libraries (like GreenSock (GSAP)) to implement your desired effects.  Remember to handle potential conflicts between the slider's built-in animation and your custom animation, possibly including delays or timing adjustments.\n\n\n### Integration with other libraries\n\nFlexSlider can be integrated with other JavaScript libraries.  The most notable integration is with jQuery, which is a requirement.  Beyond jQuery,  integrating with other libraries requires careful consideration of potential conflicts or timing issues.  For instance, using animation libraries alongside FlexSlider's `before` and `after` callbacks requires coordinating the animations to ensure a smooth user experience; otherwise, conflicts could result in janky or unexpected visual results.  Always test thoroughly after integrating FlexSlider with other libraries.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nThis section provides guidance on resolving common issues encountered when using FlexSlider.\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Slider not working:**  Double-check that you've included jQuery and the FlexSlider JavaScript and CSS files correctly. Ensure the paths to these files are accurate and that jQuery is included *before* the FlexSlider script.  Inspect your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors. Verify that your HTML markup follows the required structure (a `<ul>` with class `slides` inside a container with the class `flexslider`).\n\n* **Incorrect image dimensions:**  If images are not displaying correctly, ensure they have proper dimensions and that the images are actually accessible at the specified paths. Using `autoHeight` may resolve issues with inconsistent image heights.\n\n* **Navigation controls not appearing:** Check that the `directionNav` option is set to `true` (the default). Also, verify that the CSS related to navigation controls isn't being overridden by your stylesheet.\n\n* **Slideshow not auto-advancing:** Ensure that the `slideshow` option is set to `true` and that `slideshowSpeed` is set to a reasonable value.\n\n* **Animation issues:** Confirm that you are using a supported animation type (`fade` or `slide`).  If custom animations are used, double-check the timing and synchronization with FlexSlider's animation lifecycle to avoid conflicts.\n\n* **Responsive issues:**  Check that CSS media queries are correctly implemented if modifying the slider's behavior for different screen sizes.  Inspect the slider's layout on different devices to ensure responsiveness is working correctly.\n\n* **Conflicts with other libraries:** If using other JavaScript libraries, be mindful of potential conflicts. Consider using namespaces or carefully managing the order of script inclusion to avoid interference.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML and CSS of the slider and debug JavaScript errors.  The console will show any errors or warnings that may be preventing FlexSlider from functioning correctly.\n\n* **Simplify:** If you're having trouble, try creating a minimal example that only includes the essential components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to isolate the problem.  This will help pinpoint the source of the issue.\n\n* **Check for conflicts:**  If using other JavaScript libraries, temporarily disable them to determine if they're interfering with FlexSlider's functionality.\n\n* **Inspect the network:** Use your browser's developer tools' Network tab to see if the CSS and JavaScript files are being loaded correctly.  Failure to load these files can prevent FlexSlider from working.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nFlexSlider generally supports modern browsers. However, very old or outdated browsers might have limited or no support.  For optimal results, target modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Thoroughly test across various browsers and devices.\n\n\n### Known Bugs\n\nAt the time of writing this manual, [Insert any known bugs or limitations here, including links to relevant issue trackers if applicable].  Always check the official FlexSlider project page or repository for the latest information on known bugs and updates.  It is recommended to use the most current stable release.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThis section provides several examples illustrating different use cases of FlexSlider.  Remember to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files as described in the \"Getting Started\" section.\n\n\n### Basic Slider Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple horizontal slider with fade transitions:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>FlexSlider Basic Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">\n<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(window).load(function() {\n    $('.flexslider').flexslider();\n  });\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"/></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.\n\n\n### Carousel Example\n\nThis example creates a carousel-style slider, showing multiple slides at once:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>FlexSlider Carousel Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">\n<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(window).load(function() {\n    $('.flexslider').flexslider({\n      animation: \"slide\",\n      animationLoop: false,\n      itemWidth: 210,\n      itemMargin: 5,\n      minItems: 2,\n      maxItems: 4\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n<style>\n.flexslider {\n  width: 860px; /* Adjust width as needed */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image4.jpg\" alt=\"Image 4\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image5.jpg\" alt=\"Image 5\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image6.jpg\" alt=\"Image 6\"/></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAdjust `itemWidth`, `itemMargin`, `minItems`, and `maxItems` to control the carousel's appearance.\n\n\n### Vertical Slider Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a vertical slider:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>FlexSlider Vertical Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">\n<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(window).load(function() {\n    $('.flexslider').flexslider({\n      direction: \"vertical\"\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"/></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe key change is setting the `direction` option to `\"vertical\"`.\n\n\n### Custom Navigation Example\n\nThis example shows how to create custom navigation buttons:  (Note: This requires more advanced JavaScript handling and is not a complete, copy-paste-ready example.  It outlines the concept.)\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n<button id=\"prev\">Previous</button>\n<button id=\"next\">Next</button>\n\n<script>\n  $('.flexslider').flexslider();\n  var slider = $('.flexslider').data('flexslider'); // Get the FlexSlider instance\n  $('#prev').click(function() { slider.prev(); });\n  $('#next').click(function() { slider.next(); });\n</script>\n```\n\nThis adds buttons that use the `prev()` and `next()` methods to control the slider.  Remember to include your slider setup within the `<div class=\"flexslider\">`.\n\n### Responsive Slider Example\n\nResponsiveness is largely handled automatically.  However, you can refine this with CSS media queries:\n\n```css\n/* Example media query for smaller screens */\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  .flexslider {\n    width: 100%; /* Slider takes full width */\n  }\n  .flex-direction-nav { /* Adjust navigation as needed */\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis example makes the slider full-width on smaller screens and hides the navigation controls. You would need to adapt this based on your design requirements.  Remember to include this CSS within a `<style>` tag in your HTML `<head>`, or in a separate CSS file linked to your HTML.  The example uses the `max-width` media query, so you will have to adapt it to your own design requirements and breakpoints.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\nFlexSlider can be installed via several methods:\n\n* **Download:** Download the latest release from the official website. Extract the contents to your project directory.  You'll find the necessary CSS and JavaScript files within.\n\n* **CDN:** Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to include FlexSlider.  This avoids the need to host the files yourself and can improve loading times for users in different geographical locations.  Many popular CDNs offer FlexSlider.  Be sure to check their specific inclusion instructions.\n\n* **NPM:** If you use Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), you can install FlexSlider via the command line: `npm install flexslider`\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nAfter installing FlexSlider, the basic usage involves including the necessary CSS and JavaScript files (detailed below), and then adding the appropriate markup to your HTML (also detailed below).  The core functionality of FlexSlider is automatically enabled upon page load once properly configured. You'll then only need to potentially customize settings to tailor the slider to your specific design requirements via the plugin's options.\n\n\n### Including CSS and JavaScript\n\nInclude the following files in your HTML document's `<head>` section:\n\n* **CSS:**  `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">` (replace `\"flexslider.css\"` with the actual path to the stylesheet).\n\n* **JavaScript:** `<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>` (You need jQuery. Ensure the path is correct).  Then include the FlexSlider JavaScript file: `<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>` (replace with the correct path).\n\n\nIt's crucial to include jQuery *before* the FlexSlider JavaScript file.  jQuery is a dependency for FlexSlider to function correctly.\n\n\n### Markup Requirements\n\nFlexSlider requires a specific HTML structure to work.  The basic markup consists of an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing list items (`<li>`) representing the slider images or content. Each `<li>` should contain the content to be displayed in the slider.  An example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li>\n      <img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\">\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\">\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\">\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\nTo initialize the slider, you'll typically use jQuery like so (placing it after including the FlexSlider JavaScript):\n\n```javascript\n$(window).load(function() {\n  $('.flexslider').flexslider();\n});\n```\n\nThis line of code selects all elements with the class `flexslider` and initializes FlexSlider on them.  The `$(window).load()` ensures the images have fully loaded before the slider initializes, preventing issues with image dimensions. Remember to replace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.  The `.slides` class is crucial for FlexSlider to identify the slider content.\n\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nFlexSlider offers a wide array of configuration options to customize its behavior.  These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `flexslider()` function.\n\n### animation:\n\nType: String\nDefault: `fade`\n\nSpecifies the animation type used for transitions between slides.  Options include: `\"fade\"`, `\"slide\"`.\n\n\n### animationLoop:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nDetermines whether the slideshow loops continuously or stops after the last slide.  Set to `false` to disable looping.\n\n\n### autoHeight:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nAutomatically adjusts the slider's height to match the height of the current slide. Useful for slides with varying content heights.\n\n\n### controlsContainer:\n\nType: String\nDefault: `\"\"` (empty string)\n\nSpecifies a selector for a custom container to hold the navigation controls (prev/next buttons).  If left empty, the controls are appended to the slider container.\n\n\n### direction:\n\nType: String\nDefault: `horizontal`\n\nSets the slider's direction. Options are: `\"horizontal\"`, `\"vertical\"`.\n\n\n### directionNav:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nEnables or disables the previous/next navigation controls.\n\n\n### slideshow:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nStarts or stops the automatic slideshow.  Set to `false` to disable auto-advancing.\n\n\n### slideshowSpeed:\n\nType: Integer\nDefault: `7000` (milliseconds)\n\nSets the interval between auto-advancing slides (in milliseconds).\n\n\n### animationSpeed:\n\nType: Integer\nDefault: `600` (milliseconds)\n\nSets the speed of the animation transitions (in milliseconds).\n\n\n### pauseOnAction:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `true`\n\nPauses the slideshow when a user interacts with the slider (e.g., clicks a navigation control).\n\n\n### pauseOnHover:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nPauses the slideshow when the mouse hovers over the slider.\n\n\n### smoothHeight:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nEnables smooth height transitions between slides with varying heights.  This is often used in conjunction with `autoHeight`.\n\n\n### startAt:\n\nType: Integer\nDefault: `0`\n\nSpecifies the index of the slide to start on (0-based index).\n\n\n### randomStart:\n\nType: Boolean\nDefault: `false`\n\nStarts the slideshow on a random slide.\n\n\n### before:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed *before* an animation begins.  The current slide index is passed as an argument.\n\n\n### after:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed *after* an animation completes.  The current slide index is passed as an argument.\n\n\n### start:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed when the slideshow starts.\n\n\n### end:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed when the slideshow ends (if `animationLoop` is `false`).\n\n\n### init:\n\nType: Function\nDefault: `null`\n\nA callback function executed when the slider is initialized.\n\n\n### Customizing Navigation\n\nFlexSlider allows customization of navigation elements beyond simply enabling or disabling them (`directionNav`).  You can create custom navigation using HTML and JavaScript, then bind it to FlexSlider's API functions to control the slider's progression.

This is useful for creating interactive elements that affect the slider.  For example, you could add buttons to explicitly move to the next or previous slides or create custom controls to jump to specific slides.  This would usually involve adding event handlers to custom buttons, calling the relevant FlexSlider method within the handler.\n\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nFlexSlider adapts to different screen sizes by default, maintaining responsiveness. However, you can further enhance its responsiveness by adjusting the configuration options and perhaps using CSS media queries to modify the slider's appearance for different screen sizes.

Always check the official FlexSlider project page or repository for the latest information on known bugs and updates.  It is recommended to use the most current stable release.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThis section provides several examples illustrating different use cases of FlexSlider.  Remember to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files as described in the \"Getting Started\" section.\n\n\n### Basic Slider Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple horizontal slider with fade transitions:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>FlexSlider Basic Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">\n<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(window).load(function() {\n    $('.flexslider').flexslider();\n  });\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"/></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.\n\n\n### Carousel Example\n\nThis example creates a carousel-style slider, showing multiple slides at once:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>FlexSlider Carousel Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">\n<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(window).load(function() {\n    $('.flexslider').flexslider({\n      animation: \"slide\",\n      animationLoop: false,\n      itemWidth: 210,\n      itemMargin: 5,\n      minItems: 2,\n      maxItems: 4\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n<style>\n.flexslider {\n  width: 860px; /* Adjust width as needed */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image4.jpg\" alt=\"Image 4\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image5.jpg\" alt=\"Image 5\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image6.jpg\" alt=\"Image 6\"/></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAdjust `itemWidth`, `itemMargin`, `minItems`, and `maxItems` to control the carousel's appearance.\n\n\n### Vertical Slider Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a vertical slider:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>FlexSlider Vertical Example</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"flexslider.css\">\n<script src=\"jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.flexslider.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  $(window).load(function() {\n    $('.flexslider').flexslider({\n      direction: \"vertical\"\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"/></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"/></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe key change is setting the `direction` option to `\"vertical\"`.\n\n\n### Custom Navigation Example\n\nThis example shows how to create custom navigation buttons:  (Note: This requires more advanced JavaScript handling and is not a complete, copy-paste-ready example.  It outlines the concept.)\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flexslider\">\n  <ul class=\"slides\">\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n<button id=\"prev\">Previous</button>\n<button id=\"next\">Next</button>\n\n<script>\n  $('.flexslider').flexslider();\n  var slider = $('.flexslider').data('flexslider'); // Get the FlexSlider instance\n  $('#prev').click(function() { slider.prev(); });\n  $('#next').click(function() { slider.next(); });\n</script>\n```\n\nThis adds buttons that use the `prev()` and `next()` methods to control the slider.  Remember to include your slider setup within the `<div class=\"flexslider\">`.\n\n### Responsive Slider Example\n\nResponsiveness is largely handled automatically.  However, you can refine this with CSS media queries:\n\n```css\n/* Example media query for smaller screens */\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  .flexslider {\n    width: 100%; /* Slider takes full width */\n  }\n  .flex-direction-nav { /* Adjust navigation as needed */\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis example makes the slider full-width on smaller screens and hides the navigation controls. You would need to adapt this based on your design requirements.  Remember to include this CSS within a `<style>` tag in your HTML `<head>`, or in a separate CSS file linked to your HTML.  The example uses the `max-width` media query, so you will have to adapt it to your own design requirements and breakpoints.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
