It's designed to simplify the process of creating user-friendly input forms for various data types, such as credit cards, phone numbers, dates, and more. Cleave.js handles the formatting automatically, ensuring data integrity and improving the user experience by providing immediate visual feedback.  It operates directly on the input element, without relying on complex frameworks or significant DOM manipulation.\n\n### Why use Cleave.js?\n\n* **Simplified Form Development:**  Cleave.js significantly reduces the amount of code needed to create formatted input fields. You avoid the complexity of manual formatting and validation.\n\n* **Improved User Experience:**  Real-time formatting provides immediate visual feedback to users, reducing errors and making data entry more intuitive.\n\n* **Enhanced Data Integrity:**  By enforcing specific formatting rules, Cleave.js helps to ensure that the data entered is in the correct format, minimizing the need for server-side validation.\n\n* **Lightweight and Fast:**  Cleave.js is designed to be small and efficient, minimizing the impact on your application's performance.  It doesn't require large dependencies.\n\n* **Customizable:**  It offers extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor the formatting to your specific needs.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nCleave.js can be easily installed via several methods:\n\n* **CDN:** Include the Cleave.js script directly from a CDN in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cleave.js@1.6.0/dist/cleave.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n* **npm:** If you're using npm, install it via:\n\n```bash\nnpm install cleave.js\n```\n\nThen, import it into your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\nimport Cleave from 'cleave.js';\n```\n\n* **Yarn:**  If you prefer Yarn, use this command:\n\n```bash\nyarn add cleave.js\n```\n\nThen, import it into your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\nimport Cleave from 'cleave.js';\n```\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nThe core of using Cleave.js involves selecting an input element and initializing a Cleave instance.  Here's a simple example formatting a phone number:\n\n\n```html\n<input type=\"tel\" id=\"phone\" placeholder=\"Phone Number\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst cleave = new Cleave('#phone', {\n  phone: true,\n});\n```\n\nThis code snippet selects the input element with the ID \"phone\" and initializes Cleave with the `phone: true` option, which automatically formats the input as a phone number.  Other options allow for various formats (credit cards, dates, etc.) and customization of delimiters and other aspects.  Refer to the advanced documentation for further options and configurations.\n\n\n## Core Features\n\n### Number Formatting\n\nCleave.js provides robust number formatting capabilities.  You can easily format numbers with thousands separators, decimal points, and control the number of decimal places.  This is achieved using the `numeral` option.\n\n**Basic Usage:**\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.numeric-input', {\n  numeral: true,\n  numeralDecimalScale: 2, // Optional: Set the number of decimal places\n});\n```\n\nThis will format the number with thousands separators and two decimal places.  Leaving out `numeralDecimalScale` will allow for a variable number of decimal places.\n\n\n### Currency Formatting\n\nCleave.js simplifies currency formatting by combining number formatting with currency symbols.  The `numeral`, `numeralThousandsGroupStyle`, and `prefix` options are key for this functionality.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.currency-input', {\n  numeral: true,\n  numeralThousandsGroupStyle: 'thousand',\n  prefix: '$',\n});\n```\n\nThis will format the input as a USD currency value with thousands separators.  You can adjust the `prefix` for other currencies (e.g., '€', '£').  Consider using a dedicated currency library for more advanced currency formatting needs.\n\n\n### Credit Card Formatting\n\nCleave.js efficiently handles credit card formatting, automatically adding spaces between groups of numbers based on the card type.  The `creditCard` option activates this feature.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.credit-card-input', {\n  creditCard: true\n});\n```\n\nThis will automatically detect the credit card type based on the input and format accordingly.  Note that Cleave.js itself doesn't perform credit card validation; you should use a dedicated library for this purpose.\n\n\n### Date Formatting\n\nCleave.js offers date formatting with various date formats supported through the `date` option and its associated sub-options like `datePattern`.\n\n**Example (MM/DD/YYYY):**\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.date-input', {\n    date: true,\n    datePattern: ['m', 'd', 'Y']\n});\n```\n\nYou can customize the `datePattern` array to define different date formats.  Consult the documentation for all available date pattern characters. Remember to handle date validation separately for robust date input.\n\n\n### Custom Delimiters\n\nCleave.js allows you to customize delimiters for various parts of the formatted output.  This includes thousands separators, decimal points, and other custom delimiters using options like `delimiter`, `decimalPoint`, and `block`, amongst others.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.custom-input', {\n  numeral: true,\n  delimiter: '.',\n  decimalPoint: ',',\n  numeralThousandsGroupStyle: 'thousand'\n});\n```\n\nThis example utilizes a period (`.`) as the thousands separator and a comma (`,`) as the decimal point, which is common in some European locales.  Adjust the options to suit your specific requirements.  Remember to always check for delimiter conflicts to avoid unexpected behavior.\n\n\n## Options and Customization\n\n### Delimiter\n\nThe `delimiter` option specifies the character used to separate blocks of digits. The default is a space.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  delimiter: '-',\n});\n```\n\nThis will use a hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter.\n\n\n### Blocks\n\nThe `blocks` option is an array defining the lengths of each block separated by the delimiter.  For example, to create a format like `XXX-XXX-XXX`, use:\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  blocks: [3, 3, 3],\n  delimiter: '-',\n});\n```\n\n\n### Prefix\n\nThe `prefix` option adds a prefix string to the beginning of the input value.\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  prefix: '+1 ',\n});\n```\n\n\n### Suffix\n\nThe `suffix` option adds a suffix string to the end of the input value.\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  suffix: ' km',\n});\n```\n\n\n### Numeric Only\n\nThe `numericOnly` option (boolean) restricts input to only numeric characters (0-9).  Defaults to `false`.\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  numericOnly: true,\n});\n```\n\n\n### Decimal\n\nThe `decimal` option (boolean) allows for a decimal point.  Defaults to `false`.  Use in conjunction with other options for full numeric formatting (see `numeral`).\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  numeral: true,\n  decimal: true,\n  delimiter: ',',\n  decimalPoint: '.'\n});\n```\n\n\n### Thousands Separator\n\nThe `thousandsSeparator` option defines the thousands separator character.  (See also `numeralThousandsGroupStyle` for controlling grouping style.)  This option is typically used with numeric formatting.\n\n\n### Auto Decimals\n\nThe `numeralDecimalScale` option (numeric) automatically sets the number of decimal places after the decimal point when the `numeral` option is used.\n\n\n### Strip\n\nThe `strip` option (boolean) determines whether non-numeric characters should be stripped from the input value before formatting.  Defaults to `true`.\n\n\n### Root\n\nThe `root` option allows specifying a different element to append the Cleave instance to.  Useful for scenarios other than directly attaching to the input element.\n\n\n### Disable Phone Region Code\n\nThe `phoneRegionCode` option can be set to `false` to disable the automatic addition of country codes when using phone number formatting.\n\n\n### Combine Credit Card\n\nThe `combineCreditCards` option combines multiple credit card numbers into a single input.\n\n### Credit Card Placeholder\n\nThe `creditCardPlaceholder` option allows defining a custom placeholder for credit card input.\n\n\n### Use Credit Card Placeholder\n\nThe `useCreditPlaceholder` option (boolean) enables or disables the default credit card placeholder.\n\n\n### Time\n\nThe `time` option (boolean) enables time formatting.  Further options control specific time formatting patterns (not detailed here, consult the documentation).\n\n\n### Date\n\nThe `date` option (boolean) enables date formatting.  `datePattern` allows customizing the date format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'MM/DD/YYYY').\n\n\n### Uppercase\n\nThe `uppercase` option (boolean) converts the input to uppercase.\n\n\n### Lowercase\n\nThe `lowercase` option (boolean) converts the input to lowercase.\n\n\n### MaxLength\n\nThe `maxLength` option limits the maximum length of the input value.\n\n\n### OnValueChanged\n\nThe `onValueChanged` callback function is triggered whenever the formatted value changes.\n\n\n### OnInput\n\nThe `onInput` callback function is triggered when the input event occurs.\n\n\n### OnKeyDown\n\nThe `onKeyDown` callback function is triggered when a key is pressed down.\n\n\n### OnKeyUp\n\nThe `onKeyUp` callback function is triggered when a key is released.\n\n\n### BeforePaste\n\nThe `beforePaste` callback function is triggered before the paste event. It is passed the pasted content and can be used to sanitize it before formatting.\n\n\n### AfterPaste\n\nThe `afterPaste` callback function is triggered after a paste event has occurred and the input has been processed.\n\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Custom Formatting\n\nBeyond the built-in formats, Cleave.js allows for highly customized formatting using the `blocks` and `delimiter` options in conjunction with other properties. You can create virtually any format by carefully defining the structure of the input.\n\nFor example, to create a format like \"AAA-BBB-CCCC-DDDD\", you would use:\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n    blocks: [3, 3, 4, 4],\n    delimiter: '-',\n});\n```\n\nRemember to handle input validation separately as Cleave.js primarily focuses on formatting, not data validation.\n\n\n### Integrating with Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)\n\nCleave.js is framework-agnostic, meaning it can be readily integrated into various JavaScript frameworks. The basic integration involves importing Cleave.js and using it within the component's lifecycle methods.\n\n**React:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport Cleave from 'cleave.js';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const cleave = new Cleave(inputRef.current, {\n      // Cleave options here\n    });\n    return () => cleave.destroy(); // Cleanup on unmount\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <input type=\"text\" ref={inputRef} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Angular:**  You would typically use Cleave.js within an Angular component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook, ensuring the Cleave instance is initialized after the component's view is initialized.  Remember to handle the destruction of the Cleave instance in `ngOnDestroy`.\n\n**Vue:**  In Vue, you would use a `mounted` lifecycle hook to initialize Cleave.js and a `beforeDestroy` hook to destroy it.  You might use a `ref` to access the input element.\n\nIn all frameworks, remember to clean up the Cleave instance (using `destroy()`) to prevent memory leaks when the component unmounts or is destroyed.\n\n\n### Handling Events\n\nCleave.js provides several events (callbacks) that you can use to react to changes in the input value.  These include `onValueChanged`, `onInput`, `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, `beforePaste`, and `afterPaste`. You can leverage these events to perform actions based on user interaction, such as updating other parts of the UI, performing real-time validation, or making API calls.\n\nFor example, using `onValueChanged`:\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  // ... other options ...\n  onValueChanged: function(e) {\n    console.log(\"Value changed:\", e.value);\n    // Perform actions based on the updated value\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Internationalization\n\nFor internationalization (i18n), you'll need to manually adjust options such as `delimiter`, `decimalPoint`, `thousandsSeparator`, and `datePattern` according to the locale. Cleave.js itself doesn't have built-in internationalization features; you are responsible for providing the correct locale-specific formatting parameters. You might consider integrating with a dedicated i18n library to manage locale-specific data.\n\n\n### Accessibility\n\nEnsure accessibility by providing appropriate ARIA attributes to the input element.  For example, include `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to describe the purpose of the input, `aria-describedby` to link to any error messages or instructions, and `aria-invalid` to indicate if the input value is invalid.  Use clear and concise labels for input fields.  Adhere to general accessibility best practices for your chosen framework.  Consider providing alternative input methods for users with disabilities, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Number Formatting\n\nThis example demonstrates basic number formatting with thousands separators and two decimal places:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"basicNumber\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#basicNumber', {\n  numeral: true,\n  numeralDecimalScale: 2,\n});\n```\n\nThis will format numbers like this:  `1,234,567.89`\n\n\n### Currency Formatting Example\n\nThis example shows currency formatting with a dollar sign prefix and thousands separators:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"currency\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#currency', {\n  numeral: true,\n  prefix: '$',\n  numeralThousandsGroupStyle: 'thousand'\n});\n```\n\nThis will format numbers like this: `$1,234,567.89`\n\n\n### Credit Card Formatting Example\n\nThis example demonstrates basic credit card formatting:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"creditCard\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#creditCard', {\n  creditCard: true\n});\n```\n\nThis will automatically format the input as a credit card number, adding spaces between groups of numbers as the user types.\n\n\n### Date Formatting Example\n\nThis example shows date formatting in MM/DD/YYYY format:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"date\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#date', {\n  date: true,\n  datePattern: ['m', 'd', 'Y']\n});\n```\n\nThis will format the input as a date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n\n### Custom Formatting Example\n\nThis example demonstrates creating a custom format using the `blocks` and `delimiter` options.  This example creates a format like AAA-BBB-CCCC:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"custom\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#custom', {\n  blocks: [3, 3, 4],\n  delimiter: '-',\n});\n```\n\nThis will format the input with three groups of digits separated by hyphens.  Remember that this only formats the input; you'll need additional validation to ensure the data entered conforms to your requirements.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Incorrect Formatting:** Double-check your Cleave.js options. Ensure that the options you've provided (e.g., `blocks`, `delimiter`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `datePattern`, etc.) accurately reflect your desired format.  Incorrect or conflicting options are a frequent source of formatting problems.  Carefully review the documentation for each option's purpose and usage.\n\n* **No Formatting at All:** Verify that Cleave.js is correctly included in your project and that the initialization code is executed after the DOM element is ready.  Inspect your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors that may be preventing Cleave.js from functioning.  Make sure the selector you are using (`#myInput`, `.myClass`, etc.) correctly targets the input element.\n\n* **Unexpected Behavior with Specific Characters:** If you encounter unexpected behavior with certain characters, ensure that your input field's `type` attribute is appropriately set (e.g., `text`, `tel`, `number`).  Some input types might have built-in browser behavior that interferes with Cleave.js's formatting.  The `strip` option can be used to control character stripping behavior.\n\n* **Memory Leaks:** Always remember to call the `destroy()` method on your Cleave instance when the component or element is no longer needed (especially in frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue). This is crucial to prevent memory leaks, particularly in applications with dynamically added or removed input fields.\n\n* **Conflicting JavaScript Libraries:**  Ensure there are no conflicts with other JavaScript libraries that might be manipulating the same DOM elements or interfering with event handling.  Test by temporarily disabling other libraries to isolate the issue.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Console:** Use your browser's developer console to check for JavaScript errors and warnings.  This can quickly pinpoint problems in your code or conflicts with other scripts.\n\n* **Inspect the Cleave Instance:** After initializing Cleave.js, you can inspect the Cleave instance using your browser's developer tools to see its properties and current state.  This can help identify if Cleave.js is correctly initialized and if the options are being applied as expected.\n\n* **Simplify Your Code:** If you're encountering complex issues, try simplifying your Cleave.js configuration to isolate the problematic option or combination of options. A minimal, reproducible example helps to identify the root cause.\n\n* **Check for Updates:** Make sure you're using the latest version of Cleave.js.  Updates often include bug fixes and improvements.\n\n* **Read the Documentation:**  The official Cleave.js documentation provides detailed explanations of the options and their usage.  Carefully review this documentation to ensure you are using the options correctly.\n\n* **Search for Existing Issues:** Check the Cleave.js issue tracker or online forums. Someone might have encountered and solved a similar problem.\n\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Constructor Options\n\nThe Cleave.js constructor accepts a wide range of options to customize its behavior.

Useful for scenarios other than directly attaching to the input element.\n\n\n### Disable Phone Region Code\n\nThe `phoneRegionCode` option can be set to `false` to disable the automatic addition of country codes when using phone number formatting.\n\n\n### Combine Credit Card\n\nThe `combineCreditCards` option combines multiple credit card numbers into a single input.\n\n### Credit Card Placeholder\n\nThe `creditCardPlaceholder` option allows defining a custom placeholder for credit card input.\n\n\n### Use Credit Card Placeholder\n\nThe `useCreditPlaceholder` option (boolean) enables or disables the default credit card placeholder.\n\n\n### Time\n\nThe `time` option (boolean) enables time formatting.  Further options control specific time formatting patterns (not detailed here, consult the documentation).\n\n\n### Date\n\nThe `date` option (boolean) enables date formatting.  `datePattern` allows customizing the date format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'MM/DD/YYYY').\n\n\n### Uppercase\n\nThe `uppercase` option (boolean) converts the input to uppercase.\n\n\n### Lowercase\n\nThe `lowercase` option (boolean) converts the input to lowercase.\n\n\n### MaxLength\n\nThe `maxLength` option limits the maximum length of the input value.\n\n\n### OnValueChanged\n\nThe `onValueChanged` callback function is triggered whenever the formatted value changes.\n\n\n### OnInput\n\nThe `onInput` callback function is triggered when the input event occurs.\n\n\n### OnKeyDown\n\nThe `onKeyDown` callback function is triggered when a key is pressed down.\n\n\n### OnKeyUp\n\nThe `onKeyUp` callback function is triggered when a key is released.\n\n\n### BeforePaste\n\nThe `beforePaste` callback function is triggered before the paste event. It is passed the pasted content and can be used to sanitize it before formatting.\n\n\n### AfterPaste\n\nThe `afterPaste` callback function is triggered after a paste event has occurred and the input has been processed.\n\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Custom Formatting\n\nBeyond the built-in formats, Cleave.js allows for highly customized formatting using the `blocks` and `delimiter` options in conjunction with other properties. You can create virtually any format by carefully defining the structure of the input.\n\nFor example, to create a format like \"AAA-BBB-CCCC-DDDD\", you would use:\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n    blocks: [3, 3, 4, 4],\n    delimiter: '-',\n});\n```\n\nRemember to handle input validation separately as Cleave.js primarily focuses on formatting, not data validation.\n\n\n### Integrating with Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)\n\nCleave.js is framework-agnostic, meaning it can be readily integrated into various JavaScript frameworks. The basic integration involves importing Cleave.js and using it within the component's lifecycle methods.\n\n**React:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport Cleave from 'cleave.js';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const cleave = new Cleave(inputRef.current, {\n      // Cleave options here\n    });\n    return () => cleave.destroy(); // Cleanup on unmount\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <input type=\"text\" ref={inputRef} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Angular:**  You would typically use Cleave.js within an Angular component's `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook, ensuring the Cleave instance is initialized after the component's view is initialized.  Remember to handle the destruction of the Cleave instance in `ngOnDestroy`.\n\n**Vue:**  In Vue, you would use a `mounted` lifecycle hook to initialize Cleave.js and a `beforeDestroy` hook to destroy it.  You might use a `ref` to access the input element.\n\nIn all frameworks, remember to clean up the Cleave instance (using `destroy()`) to prevent memory leaks when the component unmounts or is destroyed.\n\n\n### Handling Events\n\nCleave.js provides several events (callbacks) that you can use to react to changes in the input value.  These include `onValueChanged`, `onInput`, `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, `beforePaste`, and `afterPaste`. You can leverage these events to perform actions based on user interaction, such as updating other parts of the UI, performing real-time validation, or making API calls.\n\nFor example, using `onValueChanged`:\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('.my-input', {\n  // ... other options ...\n  onValueChanged: function(e) {\n    console.log(\"Value changed:\", e.value);\n    // Perform actions based on the updated value\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Internationalization\n\nFor internationalization (i18n), you'll need to manually adjust options such as `delimiter`, `decimalPoint`, `thousandsSeparator`, and `datePattern` according to the locale. Cleave.js itself doesn't have built-in internationalization features; you are responsible for providing the correct locale-specific formatting parameters. You might consider integrating with a dedicated i18n library to manage locale-specific data.\n\n\n### Accessibility\n\nEnsure accessibility by providing appropriate ARIA attributes to the input element.  For example, include `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to describe the purpose of the input, `aria-describedby` to link to any error messages or instructions, and `aria-invalid` to indicate if the input value is invalid.  Use clear and concise labels for input fields.  Adhere to general accessibility best practices for your chosen framework.  Consider providing alternative input methods for users with disabilities, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Number Formatting\n\nThis example demonstrates basic number formatting with thousands separators and two decimal places:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"basicNumber\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#basicNumber', {\n  numeral: true,\n  numeralDecimalScale: 2,\n});\n```\n\nThis will format numbers like this:  `1,234,567.89`\n\n\n### Currency Formatting Example\n\nThis example shows currency formatting with a dollar sign prefix and thousands separators:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"currency\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#currency', {\n  numeral: true,\n  prefix: '$',\n  numeralThousandsGroupStyle: 'thousand'\n});\n```\n\nThis will format numbers like this: `$1,234,567.89`\n\n\n### Credit Card Formatting Example\n\nThis example demonstrates basic credit card formatting:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"creditCard\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#creditCard', {\n  creditCard: true\n});\n```\n\nThis will automatically format the input as a credit card number, adding spaces between groups of numbers as the user types.\n\n\n### Date Formatting Example\n\nThis example shows date formatting in MM/DD/YYYY format:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"date\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#date', {\n  date: true,\n  datePattern: ['m', 'd', 'Y']\n});\n```\n\nThis will format the input as a date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\n\n### Custom Formatting Example\n\nThis example demonstrates creating a custom format using the `blocks` and `delimiter` options.  This example creates a format like AAA-BBB-CCCC:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"custom\">\n```\n\n```javascript\nnew Cleave('#custom', {\n  blocks: [3, 3, 4],\n  delimiter: '-',\n});\n```\n\nThis will format the input with three groups of digits separated by hyphens.  Remember that this only formats the input; you'll need additional validation to ensure the data entered conforms to your requirements.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Incorrect Formatting:** Double-check your Cleave.js options. Ensure that the options you've provided (e.g., `blocks`, `delimiter`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `datePattern`, etc.) accurately reflect your desired format.  Incorrect or conflicting options are a frequent source of formatting problems.  Carefully review the documentation for each option's purpose and usage.\n\n* **No Formatting at All:** Verify that Cleave.js is correctly included in your project and that the initialization code is executed after the DOM element is ready.  Inspect your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors that may be preventing Cleave.js from functioning.  Make sure the selector you are using (`#myInput`, `.myClass`, etc.) correctly targets the input element.\n\n* **Unexpected Behavior with Specific Characters:** If you encounter unexpected behavior with certain characters, ensure that your input field's `type` attribute is appropriately set (e.g., `text`, `tel`, `number`).  Some input types might have built-in browser behavior that interferes with Cleave.js's formatting.  The `strip` option can be used to control character stripping behavior.\n\n* **Memory Leaks:** Always remember to call the `destroy()` method on your Cleave instance when the component or element is no longer needed (especially in frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue). This is crucial to prevent memory leaks, particularly in applications with dynamically added or removed input fields.\n\n* **Conflicting JavaScript Libraries:**  Ensure there are no conflicts with other JavaScript libraries that might be manipulating the same DOM elements or interfering with event handling.  Test by temporarily disabling other libraries to isolate the issue.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Console:** Use your browser's developer console to check for JavaScript errors and warnings.  This can quickly pinpoint problems in your code or conflicts with other scripts.\n\n* **Inspect the Cleave Instance:** After initializing Cleave.js, you can inspect the Cleave instance using your browser's developer tools to see its properties and current state.  This can help identify if Cleave.js is correctly initialized and if the options are being applied as expected.\n\n* **Simplify Your Code:** If you're encountering complex issues, try simplifying your Cleave.js configuration to isolate the problematic option or combination of options. A minimal, reproducible example helps to identify the root cause.\n\n* **Check for Updates:** Make sure you're using the latest version of Cleave.js.  Updates often include bug fixes and improvements.\n\n* **Read the Documentation:**  The official Cleave.js documentation provides detailed explanations of the options and their usage.  Carefully review this documentation to ensure you are using the options correctly.\n\n* **Search for Existing Issues:** Check the Cleave.js issue tracker or online forums. Someone might have encountered and solved a similar problem.\n\n\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Constructor Options\n\nThe Cleave.js constructor accepts a wide range of options to customize its behavior.
