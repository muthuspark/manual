It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating, animating, and manipulating SVG elements within web browsers.  Unlike directly manipulating the DOM, Snap.svg offers a more abstract and efficient way to work with SVG, handling many of the complexities of SVG rendering and animation.  It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic vector graphics with ease, making it a versatile tool for web designers and developers.\n\n\n### Why use Snap.svg?\n\nSnap.svg offers several compelling reasons for its use in SVG-based projects:\n\n* **Simplified SVG manipulation:** Snap.svg abstracts away much of the complexity of working directly with the SVG DOM, offering a cleaner and more consistent API.  This simplifies common tasks like creating shapes, applying transformations, and animating elements.\n\n* **Cross-browser compatibility:** Snap.svg handles the inconsistencies between different browsers' SVG rendering engines, ensuring your graphics render correctly across various platforms and devices.\n\n* **Animation capabilities:**  The library provides robust animation features, allowing you to create complex and smooth animations with ease using various easing functions and animation parameters.\n\n* **Lightweight and efficient:** Snap.svg is designed to be small and fast, minimizing the impact on your website's performance.\n\n* **Extensive features:**  Beyond basic shape creation and animation, Snap.svg offers features such as event handling, transformations (rotate, scale, translate), matrix manipulation, and more.\n\n\n### Setting up Snap.svg\n\nIncluding Snap.svg in your project is straightforward. You can either download the library directly from the official website and include it via a `<script>` tag in your HTML file, or use a package manager like npm or yarn if you're working on a larger project.\n\n**Using a `<script>` tag:**\n\n```html\n<script src=\"snap.svg.js\"></script>\n```\n\nReplace `\"snap.svg.js\"` with the actual path to the downloaded Snap.svg library file.\n\n**Using npm or yarn (example with npm):**\n\n```bash\nnpm install snapsvg\n```\n\nThen, import it into your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\nimport Snap from 'snapsvg';\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the import path according to your project structure.\n\n\n### Basic Concepts and Terminology\n\nUnderstanding these core concepts is crucial for effectively using Snap.svg:\n\n* **Snap object:** The main object representing the SVG drawing area.  It's created by calling `Snap(selector)` where `selector` is a CSS selector targeting the SVG element in your HTML.  This object provides methods for creating and manipulating SVG elements.\n\n* **Paper:** A synonym for the Snap object, often used interchangeably.\n\n* **Elements:**  These represent individual SVG shapes and graphical objects within your SVG drawing (e.g., circles, rectangles, paths, text).  They are created using methods of the Snap object (e.g., `paper.circle()`, `paper.rect()`, `paper.path()`).\n\n* **Attributes:**  Properties of elements that define their visual appearance and behavior (e.g., fill color, stroke width, transformation matrix).  Attributes are set using methods like `.attr()`.\n\n* **Transformation:** Changing the position, scale, rotation, or skew of an element.  Snap.svg provides convenient methods for transformations such as `.translate()`, `.rotate()`, `.scale()`, and `.transform()`.\n\n* **Animation:** Changing element attributes over time to create animations. Snap.svg offers a variety of animation methods for various types of attributes and easing functions.\n\n* **Events:** Actions triggered by user interactions (e.g., clicks, mouseovers) or other events.  Snap.svg allows you to attach event listeners to elements for handling these interactions.\n\n\n## Creating and Manipulating Shapes\n\n### Creating basic shapes (rect, circle, ellipse, line, polygon, path)\n\nSnap.svg provides methods for easily creating common SVG shapes.  Each method returns a Snap element object that you can further manipulate.  The parameters passed to these methods vary depending on the shape.\n\n* **Rectangle (`rect(x, y, width, height, rx, ry)`):** Creates a rectangle. `x` and `y` specify the top-left corner coordinates, `width` and `height` define the dimensions, and `rx` and `ry` define the corner radius (optional, for rounded rectangles).\n\n```javascript\nvar paper = Snap(\"#svg\");\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 30, 5);\n```\n\n* **Circle (`circle(cx, cy, r)`):** Creates a circle. `cx` and `cy` are the center coordinates, and `r` is the radius.\n\n```javascript\nvar circle = paper.circle(100, 50, 25);\n```\n\n* **Ellipse (`ellipse(cx, cy, rx, ry)`):** Creates an ellipse. `cx` and `cy` are the center coordinates, `rx` is the horizontal radius, and `ry` is the vertical radius.\n\n```javascript\nvar ellipse = paper.ellipse(150, 100, 40, 20);\n```\n\n* **Line (`line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`):** Creates a line from point (`x1`, `y1`) to point (`x2`, `y2`).\n\n```javascript\nvar line = paper.line(200, 20, 250, 80);\n```\n\n* **Polygon (`polygon(points)`):** Creates a polygon from an array of points. `points` is a string of comma-separated x,y pairs  (e.g., \"10,10, 20,30, 30,10\").\n\n```javascript\nvar polygon = paper.polygon(\"10,10, 20,30, 30,10\");\n```\n\n* **Path (`path(pathString)`):** Creates a path using SVG path data. This is the most versatile shape, allowing for complex shapes.\n\n```javascript\nvar path = paper.path(\"M10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 Z\"); //Example: a square\n```\n\n\n### Attributes and styling\n\nYou can modify the appearance of shapes using attributes.  The `.attr()` method is used to set or get attributes.  Attributes can include fill color, stroke color and width, opacity, and more.\n\n```javascript\nrect.attr({\n  fill: \"blue\",\n  stroke: \"red\",\n  strokeWidth: 3\n});\n\ncircle.attr({ fill: \"#f00\", opacity: 0.5 });\n```\n\n\n### Transformations (translate, rotate, scale, matrix)\n\nTransformations change the position, orientation, and size of shapes.\n\n* **`translate(tx, ty)`:** Moves the shape by `tx` units horizontally and `ty` units vertically.\n\n* **`rotate(angle, cx, cy)`:** Rotates the shape by `angle` degrees around the point (`cx`, `cy`). If `cx` and `cy` are omitted, rotation is around the shape's center.\n\n* **`scale(sx, sy)`:** Scales the shape by `sx` horizontally and `sy` vertically.\n\n* **`matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)`:** Applies a transformation matrix. This provides the most control but is more complex.\n\n\n```javascript\nrect.translate(20, 20);\ncircle.rotate(45);\nellipse.scale(2, 1.5);\n```\n\nTransformations can be chained or combined using the `.transform()` method with a string specifying multiple transformations (e.g., `rect.transform(\"t10,10r45s2,1.5\")`).\n\n\n### Combining and grouping shapes\n\nYou can combine multiple shapes into groups using the `.group()` method.  Transformations applied to a group affect all elements within the group.\n\n```javascript\nvar group = paper.group(rect, circle);\ngroup.translate(50, 50);\n```\n\n\n### Working with paths\n\nPaths provide maximum flexibility for creating complex shapes.  They are defined using a path string based on SVG path commands (M, L, C, Q, etc.).  Snap.svg provides methods for creating and manipulating paths, including:\n\n* **`paper.path(pathString)`:** Creates a path from a path string.\n\n* **`path.getPointAtLength(length)`:** Returns the coordinate of a point at a given length along the path.\n\n* **`path.getSubpath(from, to)`:** Extracts a sub-path from the path.\n\n* **`path.toString()`:** Returns the path data as a string.  Useful for modifying and re-applying path data.\n\nMany Snap.svg methods work with both individual shapes and path data, making it a powerful and unified system for vector graphics manipulation.  For example, you can apply transformations, attributes, and animations to paths just as you would to simpler shapes.\n\n\n## Working with Text\n\n### Adding text elements\n\nSnap.svg allows you to add text elements to your SVG using the `text()` method.  The method takes several arguments:\n\n* **`x`:** The x-coordinate of the text's starting point.\n* **`y`:** The y-coordinate of the text's baseline.\n* **`textString`:** The text string to display.\n\nOptionally, you can provide additional x and y coordinates for subsequent lines of text if you're creating multi-line text.\n\n```javascript\nvar paper = Snap(\"#svg\");\nvar text = paper.text(50, 50, \"Hello, Snap.svg!\");\n```\n\nThis creates a text element with the specified text at the given coordinates. Note that the y-coordinate refers to the baseline of the text, not the top.\n\n\n### Text formatting and styling\n\nYou can style your text using attributes similar to shapes:\n\n* **`text`:** The text content itself (can be updated later).\n* **`font-family`:**  Specifies the font family (e.g., \"Arial\", \"Times New Roman\", \"sans-serif\").\n* **`font-size`:** Specifies the font size (e.g., \"16px\", \"1em\").\n* **`font-weight`:** Specifies the font weight (e.g., \"bold\", \"normal\").\n* **`fill`:** Specifies the text color.\n* **`text-anchor`:** Controls text alignment within its bounding box (e.g., \"start\", \"middle\", \"end\").  This affects horizontal alignment.\n\n\n```javascript\ntext.attr({\n  \"font-family\": \"Arial\",\n  \"font-size\": \"20px\",\n  \"font-weight\": \"bold\",\n  fill: \"#0000FF\",\n  \"text-anchor\": \"middle\"\n});\n```\n\n\n### Text alignment and positioning\n\nPrecise control over text alignment and positioning is important.  Besides `text-anchor`, you can use the following:\n\n* **`text-anchor` (horizontal):** As mentioned above, controls horizontal alignment within the text bounding box (\"start\", \"middle\", \"end\").  \"Start\" aligns to the left, \"middle\" centers the text horizontally, and \"end\" aligns to the right.\n\n* **`dominant-baseline` (vertical):** Controls vertical alignment relative to the bounding box.  Common values include:\n    * `\"auto\"`: Browser default.\n    * `\"central\"`: Centers the text vertically.\n    * `\"text-before-edge\"`: Aligns the top of the text to the baseline.\n    * `\"text-after-edge\"`: Aligns the bottom of the text to the baseline.  This is often useful when the text has descenders.\n\nUsing both `text-anchor` and `dominant-baseline` allows precise positioning of your text within its containing space. You can also position multiple lines of text by providing additional x,y coordinates in the `text()` method or by manipulating individual `tspan` elements within the text node.\n\nRemember that the coordinates in the `text()` method specify the origin point for the first line of text. Subsequent lines' positioning will depend on the overall text formatting and dimensions. For advanced multi-line text layout, consider using `tspan` elements directly, which give you fine-grained control over each line's placement.\n\n```javascript\n// Example with multiple lines and vertical alignment\nvar multilineText = paper.text(100, 100, [\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\"]);\nmultilineText.attr({\n  \"font-size\": \"14px\",\n  \"dominant-baseline\": \"central\"\n});\n\n```\n\n\n## Animation and Effects\n\n### Animating attributes\n\nSnap.svg provides powerful animation capabilities.  You can animate almost any attribute of a Snap element using the `.animate()` method.  This method takes at least two arguments:\n\n* **`attrs`:** An object containing the target attribute values.\n* **`duration`:** The animation duration in milliseconds.\n\nOptionally, you can add an easing function and a callback function.\n\n```javascript\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);\n\nrect.animate({x: 100, y: 100, fill: \"red\"}, 1000); // Animates x, y, and fill over 1 second\n```\n\nThis example animates the rectangle's `x`, `y`, and `fill` attributes to their new values over one second.  Many attributes can be animated including transformations (like `transform`), stroke attributes (`stroke-width`, `stroke-dasharray`), and more.\n\n\n### Animation timing and easing functions\n\nThe duration controls the animation's length. The optional third argument to `.animate()` is the easing function, which determines the animation's speed curve. Snap.svg provides several built-in easing functions:\n\n* `\"linear\"`: Constant speed.\n* `\"ease\"`:  Standard easing (slow start and end).\n* `\"ease-in\"`: Slow start.\n* `\"ease-out\"`: Slow end.\n* `\"ease-in-out\"`: Slow start and end.\n* `\"elastic\"`: Elastic effect.\n* `\"bounce\"`: Bounce effect.\n\nYou can also specify a custom easing function if needed.\n\n```javascript\nrect.animate({width: 100}, 1000, mina.elastic); // Animate width with elastic easing\n```\n\n\n### Chaining animations\n\nYou can chain animations together so that one animation starts after the previous one completes:\n\n```javascript\nrect.animate({x: 100}, 1000, mina.linear)\n   .animate({y: 100}, 1000, mina.easeIn);\n```\n\nThis first animates the `x` attribute, then the `y` attribute after the first animation is complete.  The return value of `.animate()` is the element itself, allowing for method chaining.\n\n\n\n### Using animation events\n\nYou can attach event listeners to animations using the `.animate()` method's optional callback function (fourth argument).  This callback function is executed when the animation completes.\n\n\n```javascript\nrect.animate({x: 200}, 1000, mina.ease, function() {\n  console.log(\"Animation complete!\");\n});\n```\n\n\n### Creating custom animations\n\nFor more complex animations or fine-grained control, you can use Snap.svg's animation system directly (usually through `Snap.animate`). `Snap.animate` gives you a way to create custom animations using a function that changes over time. This allows for animations not easily achievable using just `.animate()`.  For instance, you might need to create a more complex animation using a looping technique, dynamically adjusting attributes based on time, or incorporating mathematical functions for special effects.\n\n\n```javascript\nSnap.animate(0, 100, function (val) {\n    rect.attr({ x: val });\n}, 1000, mina.linear); // Custom animation of x coordinate\n```\n\nThis example animates the `x` attribute from 0 to 100 over 1 second using a custom animation function.  Remember that the `mina` library (included with Snap.svg) provides various easing functions for use within custom animations.  Using `Snap.animate` gives you lower-level access and is useful when pre-built animation methods are insufficient.\n\n\n## Event Handling\n\n### Attaching event listeners\n\nSnap.svg allows you to attach event listeners to SVG elements using the standard JavaScript `addEventListener` method or the equivalent `on` method provided by Snap.  The key difference is that Snap.svg handles the event's target appropriately within the SVG context.\n\n**Using `addEventListener`:**\n\n```javascript\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);\nrect.node.addEventListener(\"click\", function(e) {\n  console.log(\"Rectangle clicked!\");\n});\n```\n\n**Using Snap.svg's `on` method:** This is often preferred for cleaner code within a Snap.svg context:\n\n```javascript\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);\nrect.on(\"click\", function(e) {\n    console.log(\"Rectangle clicked!\");\n    console.log(e); //Provides event details, like clientX and clientY\n});\n```\n\nBoth methods achieve the same outcome, but the `on` method is more concise and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Snap.svg API.\n\n\n### Handling mouse events\n\nSnap.svg supports common mouse events:\n\n* `\"click\"`: When the mouse button is clicked.\n* `\"mousedown\"`: When the mouse button is pressed down.\n* `\"mouseup\"`: When the mouse button is released.\n* `\"mouseover\"`: When the mouse pointer moves over the element.\n* `\"mouseout\"`: When the mouse pointer moves out of the element.\n* `\"mousemove\"`: When the mouse pointer moves while over the element.\n* `\"dblclick\"`: When the element is double-clicked.\n\nExample using mouse events to change fill color:\n\n```javascript\nvar circle = paper.circle(100, 100, 30);\n\ncircle.on(\"mouseover\", function() {\n  this.attr({ fill: \"red\" });\n});\n\ncircle.on(\"mouseout\", function() {\n  this.attr({ fill: \"blue\" });\n});\n```\n\n\n### Handling other events\n\nBesides mouse events, you can handle other events relevant to animations or other interactions:\n\n* **Animation events:** While not directly part of the `on` method, you can use callbacks within the `.animate()` method to respond to animation completion (see the Animation section for details).\n\n* **Custom events:** You can dispatch and listen for custom events using the standard JavaScript `dispatchEvent` and `addEventListener` methods (or Snap.svg's equivalent). This allows for creating more complex interactions between different parts of your SVG application.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar circle = paper.circle(50,50,20);\nvar rect = paper.rect(150,50,30,30);\n\nfunction myCustomEvent(eventName,data){\n    var event = new Event(eventName);\n    event.data = data;\n    rect.node.dispatchEvent(event);\n}\n\ncircle.on('click',function(e){\n    myCustomEvent('customCircleClick',{message:\"Circle clicked!\"});\n});\n\nrect.addEventListener('customCircleClick',function(e){\n    console.log(e.data.message);\n    this.attr({fill:'red'});\n});\n```\n\nRemember to always detach event listeners when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks, especially in applications with many dynamic elements.  Use the `.off()` method to remove event listeners.  For example: `circle.off(\"click\");`\n\n\n\n\n## Working with Images\n\n### Adding images\n\nSnap.svg allows you to easily incorporate images into your SVG using the `image()` method. This method takes the following arguments:\n\n* **`src`:** The URL of the image file.\n* **`x`:** The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the image.\n* **`y`:** The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the image.\n* **`width`:** The width of the image.\n* **`height`:** The height of the image.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar paper = Snap(\"#svg\");\nvar img = paper.image(\"myimage.jpg\", 10, 10, 100, 100);\n```\n\nThis code snippet inserts an image located at `myimage.jpg` into the SVG at the specified coordinates with a width and height of 100 pixels each.  Ensure that the image path is correct relative to your HTML file.\n\n\n### Image manipulation and styling\n\nWhile Snap.svg offers fewer direct manipulation options for images compared to shapes, you can still style and transform them using attributes:\n\n* **`x`, `y`:**  These attributes control the image's position, as described above.  You can change them dynamically after adding the image using the `.attr()` method.\n\n* **`width`, `height`:** These attributes control the image's dimensions.  Changing these will scale the image.\n\n* **`opacity`:** Controls the image's transparency.\n\n* **`transform`:** Applies transformations (rotate, scale, translate, etc.) to the image.   Note that scaling might lead to pixelation depending on the image quality and scaling factor.\n\n\n```javascript\nimg.attr({\n  opacity: 0.7,\n  transform: \"r45,50,50\" // Rotate by 45 degrees around point (50,50)\n});\n```\n\n\n### Image positioning and alignment\n\nImage positioning is controlled by the `x` and `y` attributes, specifying the top-left corner's coordinates within the SVG's coordinate system.  For precise alignment, you might need to calculate the appropriate coordinates based on the image's dimensions and the desired position relative to other elements in your SVG.  Use the image's `width` and `height` attributes to help determine the correct coordinates for centering or aligning the image to other shapes.\n\nFor example, to center an image within a specific area:\n\n```javascript\nvar imgWidth = 100;\nvar imgHeight = 100;\nvar containerWidth = 200;\nvar containerHeight = 200;\n\nvar imgX = (containerWidth - imgWidth) / 2;\nvar imgY = (containerHeight - imgHeight) / 2;\n\nvar img = paper.image(\"myimage.jpg\", imgX, imgY, imgWidth, imgHeight);\n```\n\nThis code centers the image within a 200x200 pixel area.  Remember that the coordinate system's origin (0,0) is usually at the top-left corner of your SVG canvas.  You might need to adjust coordinates based on the `viewBox` attribute of your SVG if it's being used.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Using Snap.svg with other libraries\n\nSnap.svg can be integrated with other JavaScript libraries to extend its functionality.  Common use cases include combining it with:\n\n* **jQuery:**  While Snap.svg doesn't require jQuery, you can use jQuery selectors to target SVG elements and then manipulate them using Snap.svg's API.\n\n* **Animation libraries (other than Snap's built-in animation):**  You might choose to use a library like GreenSock (GSAP) for more advanced animation features or to manage complex animations more efficiently.  In such cases, you would create your SVG elements with Snap.svg but handle animation with the external library, directly manipulating the SVG elements' attributes.\n\n* **Data visualization libraries:**  Libraries like D3.js are often used for data visualization.  You can create the visual representation using Snap.svg while using D3.js for data manipulation and analysis.\n\n\nThe key to successful integration is understanding the APIs of both libraries and how they interact with the DOM.  Often, you'll use one library to create or select elements, and the other to manipulate their properties or animations.\n\n\n\n### Creating custom plugins\n\nSnap.svg's architecture allows for the creation of custom plugins to extend its capabilities. Plugins can encapsulate reusable functionality, such as custom shapes, animations, or effects.  A plugin typically consists of JavaScript code that adds new methods or properties to the Snap object or its elements.  This requires a good understanding of JavaScript's prototype system and Snap.svg's internal structure.  While creating plugins adds complexity, they allow for creating highly customized and reusable components within larger projects.\n\n\n### Optimizing performance\n\nOptimizing performance is crucial for large or complex SVG projects using Snap.svg. Key strategies include:\n\n* **Minimizing DOM manipulations:**  Directly manipulating the DOM is generally less efficient than using Snap.svg's higher-level API.  Avoid frequent, small changes to the DOM whenever possible.  Batch multiple changes together using Snap.svg's methods.\n\n* **Using caching:** When possible, cache frequently accessed elements or data to avoid recalculations.  This is especially important for animations or interactive elements that involve repeated operations.\n\n* **Efficient event handling:** Attach and detach event listeners appropriately to prevent unnecessary processing. Use event delegation where suitable.\n\n* **Optimizing path data:**  For complex paths, consider simplifying the path data to reduce the rendering workload.\n\n* **Lazy loading:** If your SVG includes many images or complex elements, consider lazy loading them to avoid initial page load delays.  This means loading resources only when needed, for example, when they come into the viewport.\n\n* **Using appropriate data structures:** For large amounts of data, choose efficient data structures to manage and access data quickly.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting common issues\n\nCommon issues and their potential solutions:\n\n* **Rendering problems:** Ensure your SVG code is valid and that your SVG element is properly included in your HTML.  Check your browser's developer console for errors.\n\n* **Animation issues:** Verify the attributes being animated are valid and that the animation parameters (duration, easing, etc.) are correctly specified.\n\n* **Event handling problems:** Double-check your event listeners are correctly attached to the desired elements.  Confirm the event listener's functionality and that no other JavaScript code is interfering.\n\n* **Performance problems:**  Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks.  Consider the optimization strategies mentioned above.\n\n* **Cross-browser compatibility:**  While Snap.svg aims for wide compatibility, minor rendering differences might exist between browsers. Test your SVG across different browsers to identify and address any discrepancies.  The browser's developer tools are invaluable for debugging in these situations.\n\n\n## Reference\n\nThis section provides a concise overview of the Snap.svg API.  For complete and detailed documentation, refer to the official Snap.svg documentation.\n\n### API Reference\n\nThe Snap.svg API is organized around several core objects. The primary entry point is the `Snap` object, which is used to create a drawing surface and manipulate SVG elements.  From there, you interact with various element objects, matrices for transformations, and animation objects for creating dynamic effects.  The API is largely method-based, with methods chaining being a core feature, allowing for concise and efficient code.  Most methods return the element itself, allowing for method chaining.\n\n\n### Global Objects\n\n* **`Snap(element)`:** The primary function to create a Snap object. Takes a CSS selector string (e.g., `\"#mySVG\"`) or a DOM element as input.  Returns a Snap object that represents the SVG drawing surface.\n\n* **`Snap.format(formatString, data)`:**  A useful utility function for formatting strings according to a given template.\n\n\n### Shape Objects\n\nShape objects are created by using methods of the Snap object (e.g., `paper.circle()`, `paper.rect()`).  These objects represent SVG shapes like circles, rectangles, ellipses, lines, polygons, and paths. They inherit from the base Element Object and have specific methods related to their shape attributes.  For example, a `Snap.Element` representing a circle would inherit methods for setting radius, center coordinates, etc., along with methods available to all `Snap.Element` objects.\n\n\n### Element Objects\n\nElement objects represent individual SVG elements within the Snap.svg context.  All shape objects (circles, rectangles, etc.) are types of `Snap.Element`.  Key methods include:\n\n* **`.attr(attrName)`:** Gets the value of attribute `attrName`.\n* **`.attr(attrName, attrValue)`:** Sets attribute `attrName` to `attrValue`.\n* **`.attr({attrName1: attrValue1, attrName2: attrValue2})`:** Sets multiple attributes at once.\n* **`.animate(attrs, duration, easing, callback)`:** Animates attributes.\n* **`.transform(transformString)`:** Applies transformations.\n* **`.on(eventName, handler)`:** Attaches an event listener.\n* **`.off(eventName, handler)`:** Detaches an event listener.\n* **`.getBBox()`:** Gets the bounding box of the element.\n* **`.select(selector)`:** Selects a child element within the current element using a CSS selector.\n\n\n### Matrix Objects\n\nMatrix objects represent affine transformations, providing a low-level way to manipulate the position, scaling, rotation, and skewing of elements.  You can create and work with matrices directly, though this is often less convenient than using the higher-level transformation methods.  Key methods usually involve matrix multiplications and transformations.\n\n\n### Animation Objects\n\nSnap.svg provides several ways to perform animations. The primary method is `.animate()`, which takes a target attribute value object and a duration.  The low-level `Snap.animate` provides custom animation control.  Easing functions (from the `mina` library) control the animation speed curve.  These functions are not objects in the traditional sense but rather callback-style functions that are used as part of the animation process.  The result of an animation is changes reflected in the target element object, updating its properties over time.  No separate \"animation object\" is returned or directly manipulated.\n\n**Note:** This is a simplified overview.  The full API reference should be consulted for a complete list of methods and properties, including detailed descriptions and examples.

This object provides methods for creating and manipulating SVG elements.\n\n* **Paper:** A synonym for the Snap object, often used interchangeably.\n\n* **Elements:**  These represent individual SVG shapes and graphical objects within your SVG drawing (e.g., circles, rectangles, paths, text).  They are created using methods of the Snap object (e.g., `paper.circle()`, `paper.rect()`, `paper.path()`).\n\n* **Attributes:**  Properties of elements that define their visual appearance and behavior (e.g., fill color, stroke width, transformation matrix).  Attributes are set using methods like `.attr()`.\n\n* **Transformation:** Changing the position, scale, rotation, or skew of an element.  Snap.svg provides convenient methods for transformations such as `.translate()`, `.rotate()`, `.scale()`, and `.transform()`.\n\n* **Animation:** Changing element attributes over time to create animations. Snap.svg offers a variety of animation methods for various types of attributes and easing functions.\n\n* **Events:** Actions triggered by user interactions (e.g., clicks, mouseovers) or other events.  Snap.svg allows you to attach event listeners to elements for handling these interactions.\n\n\n## Creating and Manipulating Shapes\n\n### Creating basic shapes (rect, circle, ellipse, line, polygon, path)\n\nSnap.svg provides methods for easily creating common SVG shapes.  Each method returns a Snap element object that you can further manipulate.  The parameters passed to these methods vary depending on the shape.\n\n* **Rectangle (`rect(x, y, width, height, rx, ry)`):** Creates a rectangle. `x` and `y` specify the top-left corner coordinates, `width` and `height` define the dimensions, and `rx` and `ry` define the corner radius (optional, for rounded rectangles).\n\n```javascript\nvar paper = Snap(\"#svg\");\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 30, 5);\n```\n\n* **Circle (`circle(cx, cy, r)`):** Creates a circle. `cx` and `cy` are the center coordinates, and `r` is the radius.\n\n```javascript\nvar circle = paper.circle(100, 50, 25);\n```\n\n* **Ellipse (`ellipse(cx, cy, rx, ry)`):** Creates an ellipse. `cx` and `cy` are the center coordinates, `rx` is the horizontal radius, and `ry` is the vertical radius.\n\n```javascript\nvar ellipse = paper.ellipse(150, 100, 40, 20);\n```\n\n* **Line (`line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`):** Creates a line from point (`x1`, `y1`) to point (`x2`, `y2`).\n\n```javascript\nvar line = paper.line(200, 20, 250, 80);\n```\n\n* **Polygon (`polygon(points)`):** Creates a polygon from an array of points. `points` is a string of comma-separated x,y pairs  (e.g., \"10,10, 20,30, 30,10\").\n\n```javascript\nvar polygon = paper.polygon(\"10,10, 20,30, 30,10\");\n```\n\n* **Path (`path(pathString)`):** Creates a path using SVG path data. This is the most versatile shape, allowing for complex shapes.\n\n```javascript\nvar path = paper.path(\"M10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 Z\"); //Example: a square\n```\n\n\n### Attributes and styling\n\nYou can modify the appearance of shapes using attributes.  The `.attr()` method is used to set or get attributes.  Attributes can include fill color, stroke color and width, opacity, and more.\n\n```javascript\nrect.attr({\n  fill: \"blue\",\n  stroke: \"red\",\n  strokeWidth: 3\n});\n\ncircle.attr({ fill: \"#f00\", opacity: 0.5 });\n```\n\n\n### Transformations (translate, rotate, scale, matrix)\n\nTransformations change the position, orientation, and size of shapes.\n\n* **`translate(tx, ty)`:** Moves the shape by `tx` units horizontally and `ty` units vertically.\n\n* **`rotate(angle, cx, cy)`:** Rotates the shape by `angle` degrees around the point (`cx`, `cy`). If `cx` and `cy` are omitted, rotation is around the shape's center.\n\n* **`scale(sx, sy)`:** Scales the shape by `sx` horizontally and `sy` vertically.\n\n* **`matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)`:** Applies a transformation matrix. This provides the most control but is more complex.\n\n\n```javascript\nrect.translate(20, 20);\ncircle.rotate(45);\nellipse.scale(2, 1.5);\n```\n\nTransformations can be chained or combined using the `.transform()` method with a string specifying multiple transformations (e.g., `rect.transform(\"t10,10r45s2,1.5\")`).\n\n\n### Combining and grouping shapes\n\nYou can combine multiple shapes into groups using the `.group()` method.  Transformations applied to a group affect all elements within the group.\n\n```javascript\nvar group = paper.group(rect, circle);\ngroup.translate(50, 50);\n```\n\n\n### Working with paths\n\nPaths provide maximum flexibility for creating complex shapes.  They are defined using a path string based on SVG path commands (M, L, C, Q, etc.).  Snap.svg provides methods for creating and manipulating paths, including:\n\n* **`paper.path(pathString)`:** Creates a path from a path string.\n\n* **`path.getPointAtLength(length)`:** Returns the coordinate of a point at a given length along the path.\n\n* **`path.getSubpath(from, to)`:** Extracts a sub-path from the path.\n\n* **`path.toString()`:** Returns the path data as a string.  Useful for modifying and re-applying path data.\n\nMany Snap.svg methods work with both individual shapes and path data, making it a powerful and unified system for vector graphics manipulation.  For example, you can apply transformations, attributes, and animations to paths just as you would to simpler shapes.\n\n\n## Working with Text\n\n### Adding text elements\n\nSnap.svg allows you to add text elements to your SVG using the `text()` method.  The method takes several arguments:\n\n* **`x`:** The x-coordinate of the text's starting point.\n* **`y`:** The y-coordinate of the text's baseline.\n* **`textString`:** The text string to display.\n\nOptionally, you can provide additional x and y coordinates for subsequent lines of text if you're creating multi-line text.\n\n```javascript\nvar paper = Snap(\"#svg\");\nvar text = paper.text(50, 50, \"Hello, Snap.svg!\");\n```\n\nThis creates a text element with the specified text at the given coordinates. Note that the y-coordinate refers to the baseline of the text, not the top.\n\n\n### Text formatting and styling\n\nYou can style your text using attributes similar to shapes:\n\n* **`text`:** The text content itself (can be updated later).\n* **`font-family`:**  Specifies the font family (e.g., \"Arial\", \"Times New Roman\", \"sans-serif\").\n* **`font-size`:** Specifies the font size (e.g., \"16px\", \"1em\").\n* **`font-weight`:** Specifies the font weight (e.g., \"bold\", \"normal\").\n* **`fill`:** Specifies the text color.\n* **`text-anchor`:** Controls text alignment within its bounding box (e.g., \"start\", \"middle\", \"end\").  This affects horizontal alignment.\n\n\n```javascript\ntext.attr({\n  \"font-family\": \"Arial\",\n  \"font-size\": \"20px\",\n  \"font-weight\": \"bold\",\n  fill: \"#0000FF\",\n  \"text-anchor\": \"middle\"\n});\n```\n\n\n### Text alignment and positioning\n\nPrecise control over text alignment and positioning is important.  Besides `text-anchor`, you can use the following:\n\n* **`text-anchor` (horizontal):** As mentioned above, controls horizontal alignment within the text bounding box (\"start\", \"middle\", \"end\").  \"Start\" aligns to the left, \"middle\" centers the text horizontally, and \"end\" aligns to the right.\n\n* **`dominant-baseline` (vertical):** Controls vertical alignment relative to the bounding box.  Common values include:\n    * `\"auto\"`: Browser default.\n    * `\"central\"`: Centers the text vertically.\n    * `\"text-before-edge\"`: Aligns the top of the text to the baseline.\n    * `\"text-after-edge\"`: Aligns the bottom of the text to the baseline.  This is often useful when the text has descenders.\n\nUsing both `text-anchor` and `dominant-baseline` allows precise positioning of your text within its containing space. You can also position multiple lines of text by providing additional x,y coordinates in the `text()` method or by manipulating individual `tspan` elements within the text node.\n\nRemember that the coordinates in the `text()` method specify the origin point for the first line of text. Subsequent lines' positioning will depend on the overall text formatting and dimensions. For advanced multi-line text layout, consider using `tspan` elements directly, which give you fine-grained control over each line's placement.\n\n```javascript\n// Example with multiple lines and vertical alignment\nvar multilineText = paper.text(100, 100, [\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\"]);\nmultilineText.attr({\n  \"font-size\": \"14px\",\n  \"dominant-baseline\": \"central\"\n});\n\n```\n\n\n## Animation and Effects\n\n### Animating attributes\n\nSnap.svg provides powerful animation capabilities.  You can animate almost any attribute of a Snap element using the `.animate()` method.  This method takes at least two arguments:\n\n* **`attrs`:** An object containing the target attribute values.\n* **`duration`:** The animation duration in milliseconds.\n\nOptionally, you can add an easing function and a callback function.\n\n```javascript\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);\n\nrect.animate({x: 100, y: 100, fill: \"red\"}, 1000); // Animates x, y, and fill over 1 second\n```\n\nThis example animates the rectangle's `x`, `y`, and `fill` attributes to their new values over one second.  Many attributes can be animated including transformations (like `transform`), stroke attributes (`stroke-width`, `stroke-dasharray`), and more.\n\n\n### Animation timing and easing functions\n\nThe duration controls the animation's length. The optional third argument to `.animate()` is the easing function, which determines the animation's speed curve. Snap.svg provides several built-in easing functions:\n\n* `\"linear\"`: Constant speed.\n* `\"ease\"`:  Standard easing (slow start and end).\n* `\"ease-in\"`: Slow start.\n* `\"ease-out\"`: Slow end.\n* `\"ease-in-out\"`: Slow start and end.\n* `\"elastic\"`: Elastic effect.\n* `\"bounce\"`: Bounce effect.\n\nYou can also specify a custom easing function if needed.\n\n```javascript\nrect.animate({width: 100}, 1000, mina.elastic); // Animate width with elastic easing\n```\n\n\n### Chaining animations\n\nYou can chain animations together so that one animation starts after the previous one completes:\n\n```javascript\nrect.animate({x: 100}, 1000, mina.linear)\n   .animate({y: 100}, 1000, mina.easeIn);\n```\n\nThis first animates the `x` attribute, then the `y` attribute after the first animation is complete.  The return value of `.animate()` is the element itself, allowing for method chaining.\n\n\n\n### Using animation events\n\nYou can attach event listeners to animations using the `.animate()` method's optional callback function (fourth argument).  This callback function is executed when the animation completes.\n\n\n```javascript\nrect.animate({x: 200}, 1000, mina.ease, function() {\n  console.log(\"Animation complete!\");\n});\n```\n\n\n### Creating custom animations\n\nFor more complex animations or fine-grained control, you can use Snap.svg's animation system directly (usually through `Snap.animate`). `Snap.animate` gives you a way to create custom animations using a function that changes over time. This allows for animations not easily achievable using just `.animate()`.  For instance, you might need to create a more complex animation using a looping technique, dynamically adjusting attributes based on time, or incorporating mathematical functions for special effects.\n\n\n```javascript\nSnap.animate(0, 100, function (val) {\n    rect.attr({ x: val });\n}, 1000, mina.linear); // Custom animation of x coordinate\n```\n\nThis example animates the `x` attribute from 0 to 100 over 1 second using a custom animation function.  Remember that the `mina` library (included with Snap.svg) provides various easing functions for use within custom animations.  Using `Snap.animate` gives you lower-level access and is useful when pre-built animation methods are insufficient.\n\n\n## Event Handling\n\n### Attaching event listeners\n\nSnap.svg allows you to attach event listeners to SVG elements using the standard JavaScript `addEventListener` method or the equivalent `on` method provided by Snap.  The key difference is that Snap.svg handles the event's target appropriately within the SVG context.\n\n**Using `addEventListener`:**\n\n```javascript\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);\nrect.node.addEventListener(\"click\", function(e) {\n  console.log(\"Rectangle clicked!\");\n});\n```\n\n**Using Snap.svg's `on` method:** This is often preferred for cleaner code within a Snap.svg context:\n\n```javascript\nvar rect = paper.rect(10, 10, 50, 50);\nrect.on(\"click\", function(e) {\n    console.log(\"Rectangle clicked!\");\n    console.log(e); //Provides event details, like clientX and clientY\n});\n```\n\nBoth methods achieve the same outcome, but the `on` method is more concise and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Snap.svg API.\n\n\n### Handling mouse events\n\nSnap.svg supports common mouse events:\n\n* `\"click\"`: When the mouse button is clicked.\n* `\"mousedown\"`: When the mouse button is pressed down.\n* `\"mouseup\"`: When the mouse button is released.\n* `\"mouseover\"`: When the mouse pointer moves over the element.\n* `\"mouseout\"`: When the mouse pointer moves out of the element.\n* `\"mousemove\"`: When the mouse pointer moves while over the element.\n* `\"dblclick\"`: When the element is double-clicked.\n\nExample using mouse events to change fill color:\n\n```javascript\nvar circle = paper.circle(100, 100, 30);\n\ncircle.on(\"mouseover\", function() {\n  this.attr({ fill: \"red\" });\n});\n\ncircle.on(\"mouseout\", function() {\n  this.attr({ fill: \"blue\" });\n});\n```\n\n\n### Handling other events\n\nBesides mouse events, you can handle other events relevant to animations or other interactions:\n\n* **Animation events:** While not directly part of the `on` method, you can use callbacks within the `.animate()` method to respond to animation completion (see the Animation section for details).\n\n* **Custom events:** You can dispatch and listen for custom events using the standard JavaScript `dispatchEvent` and `addEventListener` methods (or Snap.svg's equivalent). This allows for creating more complex interactions between different parts of your SVG application.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar circle = paper.circle(50,50,20);\nvar rect = paper.rect(150,50,30,30);\n\nfunction myCustomEvent(eventName,data){\n    var event = new Event(eventName);\n    event.data = data;\n    rect.node.dispatchEvent(event);\n}\n\ncircle.on('click',function(e){\n    myCustomEvent('customCircleClick',{message:\"Circle clicked!\"});\n});\n\nrect.addEventListener('customCircleClick',function(e){\n    console.log(e.data.message);\n    this.attr({fill:'red'});\n});\n```\n\nRemember to always detach event listeners when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks, especially in applications with many dynamic elements.  Use the `.off()` method to remove event listeners.  For example: `circle.off(\"click\");`\n\n\n\n\n## Working with Images\n\n### Adding images\n\nSnap.svg allows you to easily incorporate images into your SVG using the `image()` method. This method takes the following arguments:\n\n* **`src`:** The URL of the image file.\n* **`x`:** The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the image.\n* **`y`:** The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the image.\n* **`width`:** The width of the image.\n* **`height`:** The height of the image.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar paper = Snap(\"#svg\");\nvar img = paper.image(\"myimage.jpg\", 10, 10, 100, 100);\n```\n\nThis code snippet inserts an image located at `myimage.jpg` into the SVG at the specified coordinates with a width and height of 100 pixels each.  Ensure that the image path is correct relative to your HTML file.\n\n\n### Image manipulation and styling\n\nWhile Snap.svg offers fewer direct manipulation options for images compared to shapes, you can still style and transform them using attributes:\n\n* **`x`, `y`:**  These attributes control the image's position, as described above.  You can change them dynamically after adding the image using the `.attr()` method.\n\n* **`width`, `height`:** These attributes control the image's dimensions.  Changing these will scale the image.\n\n* **`opacity`:** Controls the image's transparency.\n\n* **`transform`:** Applies transformations (rotate, scale, translate, etc.) to the image.   Note that scaling might lead to pixelation depending on the image quality and scaling factor.\n\n\n```javascript\nimg.attr({\n  opacity: 0.7,\n  transform: \"r45,50,50\" // Rotate by 45 degrees around point (50,50)\n});\n```\n\n\n### Image positioning and alignment\n\nImage positioning is controlled by the `x` and `y` attributes, specifying the top-left corner's coordinates within the SVG's coordinate system.  For precise alignment, you might need to calculate the appropriate coordinates based on the image's dimensions and the desired position relative to other elements in your SVG.  Use the image's `width` and `height` attributes to help determine the correct coordinates for centering or aligning the image to other shapes.\n\nFor example, to center an image within a specific area:\n\n```javascript\nvar imgWidth = 100;\nvar imgHeight = 100;\nvar containerWidth = 200;\nvar containerHeight = 200;\n\nvar imgX = (containerWidth - imgWidth) / 2;\nvar imgY = (containerHeight - imgHeight) / 2;\n\nvar img = paper.image(\"myimage.jpg\", imgX, imgY, imgWidth, imgHeight);\n```\n\nThis code centers the image within a 200x200 pixel area.  Remember that the coordinate system's origin (0,0) is usually at the top-left corner of your SVG canvas.  You might need to adjust coordinates based on the `viewBox` attribute of your SVG if it's being used.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Using Snap.svg with other libraries\n\nSnap.svg can be integrated with other JavaScript libraries to extend its functionality.  Common use cases include combining it with:\n\n* **jQuery:**  While Snap.svg doesn't require jQuery, you can use jQuery selectors to target SVG elements and then manipulate them using Snap.svg's API.\n\n* **Animation libraries (other than Snap's built-in animation):**  You might choose to use a library like GreenSock (GSAP) for more advanced animation features or to manage complex animations more efficiently.  In such cases, you would create your SVG elements with Snap.svg but handle animation with the external library, directly manipulating the SVG elements' attributes.\n\n* **Data visualization libraries:**  Libraries like D3.js are often used for data visualization.  You can create the visual representation using Snap.svg while using D3.js for data manipulation and analysis.\n\n\nThe key to successful integration is understanding the APIs of both libraries and how they interact with the DOM.  Often, you'll use one library to create or select elements, and the other to manipulate their properties or animations.\n\n\n\n### Creating custom plugins\n\nSnap.svg's architecture allows for the creation of custom plugins to extend its capabilities. Plugins can encapsulate reusable functionality, such as custom shapes, animations, or effects.  A plugin typically consists of JavaScript code that adds new methods or properties to the Snap object or its elements.  This requires a good understanding of JavaScript's prototype system and Snap.svg's internal structure.  While creating plugins adds complexity, they allow for creating highly customized and reusable components within larger projects.\n\n\n### Optimizing performance\n\nOptimizing performance is crucial for large or complex SVG projects using Snap.svg. Key strategies include:\n\n* **Minimizing DOM manipulations:**  Directly manipulating the DOM is generally less efficient than using Snap.svg's higher-level API.  Avoid frequent, small changes to the DOM whenever possible.  Batch multiple changes together using Snap.svg's methods.\n\n* **Using caching:** When possible, cache frequently accessed elements or data to avoid recalculations.  This is especially important for animations or interactive elements that involve repeated operations.\n\n* **Efficient event handling:** Attach and detach event listeners appropriately to prevent unnecessary processing. Use event delegation where suitable.\n\n* **Optimizing path data:**  For complex paths, consider simplifying the path data to reduce the rendering workload.\n\n* **Lazy loading:** If your SVG includes many images or complex elements, consider lazy loading them to avoid initial page load delays.  This means loading resources only when needed, for example, when they come into the viewport.\n\n* **Using appropriate data structures:** For large amounts of data, choose efficient data structures to manage and access data quickly.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting common issues\n\nCommon issues and their potential solutions:\n\n* **Rendering problems:** Ensure your SVG code is valid and that your SVG element is properly included in your HTML.  Check your browser's developer console for errors.\n\n* **Animation issues:** Verify the attributes being animated are valid and that the animation parameters (duration, easing, etc.) are correctly specified.\n\n* **Event handling problems:** Double-check your event listeners are correctly attached to the desired elements.  Confirm the event listener's functionality and that no other JavaScript code is interfering.\n\n* **Performance problems:**  Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks.  Consider the optimization strategies mentioned above.\n\n* **Cross-browser compatibility:**  While Snap.svg aims for wide compatibility, minor rendering differences might exist between browsers. Test your SVG across different browsers to identify and address any discrepancies.  The browser's developer tools are invaluable for debugging in these situations.\n\n\n## Reference\n\nThis section provides a concise overview of the Snap.svg API.  For complete and detailed documentation, refer to the official Snap.svg documentation.\n\n### API Reference\n\nThe Snap.svg API is organized around several core objects. The primary entry point is the `Snap` object, which is used to create a drawing surface and manipulate SVG elements.  From there, you interact with various element objects, matrices for transformations, and animation objects for creating dynamic effects.  The API is largely method-based, with methods chaining being a core feature, allowing for concise and efficient code.  Most methods return the element itself, allowing for method chaining.\n\n\n### Global Objects\n\n* **`Snap(element)`:** The primary function to create a Snap object. Takes a CSS selector string (e.g., `\"#mySVG\"`) or a DOM element as input.  Returns a Snap object that represents the SVG drawing surface.\n\n* **`Snap.format(formatString, data)`:**  A useful utility function for formatting strings according to a given template.\n\n\n### Shape Objects\n\nShape objects are created by using methods of the Snap object (e.g., `paper.circle()`, `paper.rect()`).  These objects represent SVG shapes like circles, rectangles, ellipses, lines, polygons, and paths. They inherit from the base Element Object and have specific methods related to their shape attributes.  For example, a `Snap.Element` representing a circle would inherit methods for setting radius, center coordinates, etc., along with methods available to all `Snap.Element` objects.\n\n\n### Element Objects\n\nElement objects represent individual SVG elements within the Snap.svg context.  All shape objects (circles, rectangles, etc.) are types of `Snap.Element`.  Key methods include:\n\n* **`.attr(attrName)`:** Gets the value of attribute `attrName`.\n* **`.attr(attrName, attrValue)`:** Sets attribute `attrName` to `attrValue`.\n* **`.attr({attrName1: attrValue1, attrName2: attrValue2})`:** Sets multiple attributes at once.\n* **`.animate(attrs, duration, easing, callback)`:** Animates attributes.\n* **`.transform(transformString)`:** Applies transformations.\n* **`.on(eventName, handler)`:** Attaches an event listener.\n* **`.off(eventName, handler)`:** Detaches an event listener.\n* **`.getBBox()`:** Gets the bounding box of the element.\n* **`.select(selector)`:** Selects a child element within the current element using a CSS selector.\n\n\n### Matrix Objects\n\nMatrix objects represent affine transformations, providing a low-level way to manipulate the position, scaling, rotation, and skewing of elements.  You can create and work with matrices directly, though this is often less convenient than using the higher-level transformation methods.  Key methods usually involve matrix multiplications and transformations.\n\n\n### Animation Objects\n\nSnap.svg provides several ways to perform animations. The primary method is `.animate()`, which takes a target attribute value object and a duration.  The low-level `Snap.animate` provides custom animation control.  Easing functions (from the `mina` library) control the animation speed curve.  These functions are not objects in the traditional sense but rather callback-style functions that are used as part of the animation process.  The result of an animation is changes reflected in the target element object, updating its properties over time.  No separate \"animation object\" is returned or directly manipulated.\n\n**Note:** This is a simplified overview.  The full API reference should be consulted for a complete list of methods and properties, including detailed descriptions and examples.  Consult the official Snap.svg documentation for exhaustive API details and examples.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
