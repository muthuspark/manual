## Core Concepts

### The Shadowbox Object

The Shadowbox object is the central component of the Shadowbox framework.  It represents a single instance of the Shadowbox lightbox, encapsulating all its functionality and properties.  The object is created using the `Shadowbox.create()` method, which takes an optional configuration object as an argument.  This configuration object allows developers to customize various aspects of the lightbox, such as its size, content, and behavior.  Key properties of the Shadowbox object include:

* **`content`:**  Specifies the content to be displayed within the lightbox. This can be HTML elements, images, videos, or any other valid DOM content.
* **`options`:** An object containing options to configure the lightbox's behavior, such as animation speed, close button visibility, and more.  See the [link to options documentation] for a full list.
* **`open()`:** A method to open the lightbox.
* **`close()`:** A method to close the lightbox.
* **`destroy()`:** A method to completely remove the lightbox from the DOM.


Example:

```javascript
const myShadowbox = Shadowbox.create({
  content: '<p>This is my lightbox content!</p>',
  options: {
    width: '500px',
    animationSpeed: 300
  }
});

myShadowbox.open();
```

### Understanding the Shadow DOM

Shadowbox leverages the Shadow DOM to encapsulate its internal structure and styling, preventing conflicts with the main application's CSS and JavaScript.  This isolation ensures that Shadowbox's functionality remains independent of the surrounding webpage's code.  The use of Shadow DOM provides several advantages, including:

* **Improved maintainability:** Changes to the Shadowbox code will not affect the rest of the application, and vice-versa.
* **Increased security:** Shadow DOM helps protect against CSS and JavaScript injection attacks.
* **Enhanced styling control:**  Shadowbox can use its own CSS without interfering with the global stylesheet.


Developers generally do not need to interact directly with the Shadow DOM, as Shadowbox manages it internally. However, understanding this underlying mechanism is essential for troubleshooting and advanced customization.

### Event Handling

Shadowbox provides several events that developers can listen for and respond to. These events allow for dynamic control and interaction with the lightbox.  Key events include:

* **`shadowbox.opened`:** Fired when the lightbox is successfully opened.
* **`shadowbox.closed`:** Fired when the lightbox is closed.
* **`shadowbox.contentloaded`:** Fired when the content within the lightbox has finished loading.
* **`shadowbox.error`:** Fired if an error occurs during the opening or closing of the lightbox.


These events can be handled using standard JavaScript event listeners.

Example:

```javascript
myShadowbox.on('shadowbox.opened', () => {
  console.log('Shadowbox opened!');
});
```

A full list of events and their details can be found in the [link to events documentation].


### Styling and Theming

Shadowbox's appearance can be customized through various methods.  The primary mechanism is by using CSS within the `options` object when creating the Shadowbox object. You can provide a CSS string or a reference to a stylesheet.  Shadowbox also allows for theming through the use of CSS variables (custom properties) which allow developers to easily change the overall look and feel of the lightbox without modifying core Shadowbox code. This ensures maintainability and extensibility.  Consult the [link to theming guide] for best practices and a detailed list of available CSS variables.


## API Reference

### Constructor and Initialization

The Shadowbox object is created using the `Shadowbox.create()` constructor.  This method takes a single, optional argument: a configuration object.  This object allows you to customize the Shadowbox instance with various options.

```javascript
// Basic initialization:
const myShadowbox = Shadowbox.create();

// Initialization with options:
const myShadowbox = Shadowbox.create({
  content: '<h1>Hello, Shadowbox!</h1>',
  options: {
    width: '600px',
    height: '400px',
    closeOnOverlayClick: true
  }
});
```

The `options` object can contain a wide array of settings.  Refer to the [link to options reference] for a comprehensive list of available options and their descriptions.  Failure to provide a `content` option will result in an empty lightbox.


### Methods: `open()`, `close()`, `destroy()`

* **`open()`:** Opens the Shadowbox lightbox.  This method doesn't take any arguments.

    ```javascript
    myShadowbox.open();
    ```

* **`close()`:** Closes the Shadowbox lightbox. This method doesn't take any arguments.

    ```javascript
    myShadowbox.close();
    ```

* **`destroy()`:** Completely removes the Shadowbox instance from the DOM.  This method is crucial to prevent memory leaks and should be called when the Shadowbox is no longer needed.  This method doesn't take any arguments.

    ```javascript
    myShadowbox.destroy();
    ```

### Methods: Content Manipulation

Shadowbox provides methods for dynamically manipulating the content displayed within the lightbox after it has been created.  These methods are particularly useful for updating content asynchronously or responding to user interactions.

* **`setContent(content)`:** Replaces the existing content of the Shadowbox with the provided `content`. The `content` can be a string of HTML, a DOM element, or any other valid content accepted by the Shadowbox.


    ```javascript
    myShadowbox.setContent('<img src="new-image.jpg">');
    ```

* **`appendContent(content)`:** Appends the provided `content` to the existing content of the Shadowbox.

    ```javascript
    myShadowbox.appendContent('<p>This text is appended.</p>');
    ```

* **`getContent()`:** Returns the current content of the Shadowbox.

    ```javascript
    let currentContent = myShadowbox.getContent();
    console.log(currentContent);
    ```

### Methods: Event Listeners

Event listeners are attached to the Shadowbox instance using the `on()` method.  This allows developers to respond to various events triggered by the lightbox.  Events include `opened`, `closed`, `contentloaded`, `error`, and others.  See the [link to Events section] for a complete list.

```javascript
myShadowbox.on('opened', () => {
  console.log('Shadowbox opened!');
});

myShadowbox.on('closed', () => {
  console.log('Shadowbox closed!');
});
```

To remove an event listener, use the `off()` method:

```javascript
myShadowbox.off('opened');
```

### Properties

The Shadowbox object exposes several properties that provide information about its state and configuration.  Key properties include:

* **`isOpen`:** A boolean indicating whether the lightbox is currently open.
* **`options`:**  An object containing the current options of the lightbox.  This is a read-only property; modifying it directly won't affect the lightbox.
* **`content`:** The content currently displayed in the lightbox.


### Callbacks and Asynchronous Operations

Several Shadowbox methods, especially those related to content loading, operate asynchronously.  To handle the completion of these operations, developers can use callbacks within the configuration object or listen for specific events.  For example, the `contentloaded` event is fired when the content inside the Shadowbox has fully loaded.  This is particularly useful when loading images or other resources that may take time.  For more complex scenarios involving promises, use the standard JavaScript promise API.


## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Shadowbox Appearance

Beyond the basic theming options, Shadowbox offers extensive customization capabilities for its visual appearance.  You can deeply modify the lightbox's look and feel by directly manipulating its CSS within the Shadow DOM. While generally discouraged for maintainability reasons, direct DOM manipulation offers ultimate control.  To access the Shadow DOM, you can use the browser's developer tools. However,  **it is strongly recommended to utilize the provided CSS variables and theming mechanisms first**, before resorting to direct manipulation.  Directly modifying the Shadow DOM may break with future updates to Shadowbox.

Remember that any custom CSS should be scoped appropriately to avoid conflicts with other stylesheets on the page.  Consider creating a dedicated stylesheet for your Shadowbox customizations.


### Integration with Other Libraries

Shadowbox is designed to be compatible with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.  However, ensure compatibility by properly managing potential conflicts between JavaScript libraries. Carefully check for naming collisions, and ensure that the order of your script inclusions in your HTML file respects any dependencies between the libraries. If issues arise, consider using techniques like immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE's) to encapsulate your Shadowbox code and its interaction with other libraries, preventing global namespace pollution.


### Handling Errors and Edge Cases

While Shadowbox is built to be robust, it's crucial to handle potential errors gracefully.  The `error` event is fired when an error occurs during Shadowbox operation. This event provides details about the error, allowing you to implement appropriate error handling and display informative messages to the user, preventing unexpected behavior and improving the user experience.  Furthermore, consider implementing robust checks for invalid input data before passing it to the Shadowbox.


### Accessibility Considerations

Creating an accessible Shadowbox experience is vital. Ensure proper ARIA attributes are applied to elements within the Shadowbox to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.  Consider adding keyboard navigation, screen-reader-friendly labels, and sufficient color contrast to ensure the lightbox is usable by users who rely on assistive technologies.  Regularly test your implementation with assistive technologies to identify and address any accessibility issues.


### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance, especially when handling large amounts of content or many Shadowbox instances, follow these best practices:

* **Lazy loading:** If your Shadowbox content includes images or videos, utilize lazy loading techniques to defer loading until necessary. This improves initial page load time.
* **Minimize DOM manipulation:**  Avoid excessive or unnecessary updates to the Shadowbox's DOM.  Batch updates whenever possible.
* **Efficient content:** Ensure the content displayed in Shadowbox is lightweight and optimized for performance.  Avoid embedding large, unoptimized images or videos.
* **Caching:** If the Shadowbox content is static, consider caching it to reduce loading times for subsequent openings.
* **Optimize CSS:** Write efficient, well-structured CSS to minimize rendering time.  Avoid overly complex selectors and styles.





## Examples and Use Cases

### Basic Modal Implementation

A simple modal can be created using Shadowbox by providing HTML content as the `content` option.  This example demonstrates a basic modal with a title and a close button:


```html
<button id="openModal">Open Modal</button>

<script>
  const openModalButton = document.getElementById('openModal');
  openModalButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const myShadowbox = Shadowbox.create({
      content: `
        <div class="modal-content">
          <h3>Modal Title</h3>
          <p>This is the modal content.</p>
          <button onclick="myShadowbox.close()">Close</button>
        </div>
      `
    });
    myShadowbox.open();
  });
</script>
```

Remember to style the `.modal-content` class appropriately using CSS to achieve the desired visual appearance.


### Image Gallery Integration

Shadowbox can easily integrate with an image gallery to create a lightbox effect when clicking on thumbnails.  Here's a basic example:

```html
<div class="gallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1" data-shadowbox-src="image1.jpg">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2" data-shadowbox-src="image2.jpg">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3" data-shadowbox-src="image3.jpg">
</div>

<script>
  const galleryImages = document.querySelectorAll('.gallery img');
  galleryImages.forEach(img => {
    img.addEventListener('click', () => {
      const myShadowbox = Shadowbox.create({
        content: `<img src="${img.dataset.shadowboxSrc}" alt="${img.alt}">`
      });
      myShadowbox.open();
    });
  });
</script>
```

This example uses the `data-shadowbox-src` attribute to specify the high-resolution image to be displayed in the lightbox.  You'll need to adapt this to your specific gallery implementation.


### Form Overlay Creation

Shadowbox can also be used to create form overlays.  This example demonstrates a simple form within a Shadowbox:

```html
<button id="openForm">Open Form</button>

<script>
  const openFormButton = document.getElementById('openForm');
  openFormButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const myShadowbox = Shadowbox.create({
      content: `
        <form>
          <label for="name">Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
          <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
      `
    });
    myShadowbox.open();
  });
</script>
```

You would typically handle form submission using JavaScript within the form's `onsubmit` event.  Remember to style the form appropriately.


### Custom Component Development

For more complex scenarios, you can develop custom components to be used with Shadowbox. This involves creating a reusable component that encapsulates specific functionality and styling. You would then integrate this custom component into your Shadowbox instance.  This allows for greater code organization and reusability.  An example might be a custom media player component that you could then easily include in multiple Shadowbox instances.  Consider using a component-based framework (like React, Vue, or Angular) to help manage complexity for larger custom components.  Remember to manage any dependencies carefully.
