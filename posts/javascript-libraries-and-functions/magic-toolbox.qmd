## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

This section addresses frequently encountered issues and their solutions.

* **Issue:**  Magic Toolbox components are not rendering correctly.
    * **Solution:**  Check that the necessary JavaScript and CSS files are included in your project and that the paths are correct. Inspect your browser's developer console for errors. Ensure that any required dependencies are properly installed.  Verify that the HTML structure and component initialization code are correct.

* **Issue:**  Images are not loading or displaying correctly within the zoom/pan or 360° viewer.
    * **Solution:** Verify that the image paths are correct and accessible.  Check image formats for compatibility. Inspect the browser's network tab to ensure images are being downloaded successfully. If using very large images, consider image preloading or optimization techniques.

* **Issue:**  Performance issues, such as slow rendering or lag.
    * **Solution:** Optimize images by reducing their size and resolution while maintaining acceptable quality. Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for Magic Toolbox.  Check for any inefficient code or unnecessary computations in your application. Consider using image preloading or lazy loading for improved performance with large images.

* **Issue:**  Error messages are displayed in the console.
    * **Solution:** Carefully examine the error messages to understand the nature of the problem. Refer to the "Error Messages" section below for explanations of common errors.

* **Issue:**  Custom CSS is not being applied correctly.
    * **Solution:** Ensure your CSS is correctly linked and has higher specificity than the default Magic Toolbox styles. Check for CSS selector conflicts. Use browser developer tools to inspect the applied styles and identify any conflicts.


### Debugging Tips

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to debug JavaScript errors, inspect network requests, and analyze performance issues. The console tab will display JavaScript errors and warnings, and the network tab will show the loading status of resources, like images.

* **Console Logging:** Strategically place `console.log()` statements in your code to track variables, function calls, and component states.  This helps identify potential issues by revealing the flow of your code's execution.

* **Code Comments:**  Add detailed comments to your code to explain the purpose of different sections and the expected behavior.  This enhances code readability and facilitates debugging.

* **Simplify Your Code:**  Temporarily remove or disable sections of your code to isolate the source of the problem.  This helps identify which parts of your code are causing the issue.

* **Version Control:** Utilize a version control system (such as Git) to track changes in your code. This allows you to easily revert to earlier versions if necessary.


### Error Messages

A comprehensive list of error messages and their explanations can be found in the Appendix of this manual or on our website at [Insert Link Here]. Common error messages might include (but aren't limited to):

* `"Image not found":` The specified image path is incorrect or the image file is not accessible.
* `"Model loading failed":`  The 3D model could not be loaded correctly; check the file path, format, and network connectivity.
