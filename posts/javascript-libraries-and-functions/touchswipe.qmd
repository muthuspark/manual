## Introduction

### What is touchSwipe?

touchSwipe is a lightweight JavaScript library that provides a simple and intuitive way to add touch swipe gestures to your web applications.  It allows developers to easily detect and respond to various swipe directions (left, right, up, down) and other touch events on elements within their web pages.  It abstracts away the complexities of handling different browsers and devices, providing a consistent cross-platform experience.

### Why use touchSwipe?

Using touchSwipe offers several key advantages:

* **Cross-browser compatibility:**  It handles the inconsistencies in touch event handling across different browsers and devices, saving you significant development time and effort.
* **Simplicity and ease of use:** The API is straightforward and easy to learn, allowing rapid integration into existing projects.
* **Lightweight:** The library is small in size, minimizing the impact on your website's performance.
* **Customization:**  Offers options to customize the sensitivity and other aspects of swipe detection.
* **Multiple Gesture Support:**  Handles more than just simple swipes.


### Browser Compatibility

touchSwipe is designed to work across a wide range of modern browsers and devices.  While striving for maximum compatibility, optimal functionality is best achieved in browsers with robust touch event support.  We recommend testing your implementation across your target browsers.  Generally, good support exists in:

* Modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
* Most mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome, etc.)
* Older browsers may require polyfills for full functionality.  Consult the library documentation for specifics.


### Getting Started: Installation and Setup

There are several ways to include touchSwipe in your project:

**1. Downloading the library:**

* Download the latest version of the touchSwipe library from [link to download - replace with actual link].
* Include the `jquery.touchSwipe.min.js` file in your HTML file within the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag.  Ensure jQuery is also included *before* touchSwipe.  The order is important:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>  <!-- Or your jQuery path -->
<script src="jquery.touchSwipe.min.js"></script>
```

**2. Using a CDN:**

* A CDN (Content Delivery Network) can provide easy access to the library.  You can include it directly in your HTML using a CDN link.  (Note: Check for the most up-to-date CDN link for the touchSwipe library).  Again, ensure jQuery is included first.

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>  <!-- Or your jQuery path -->
<script src="[CDN link for touchSwipe]"></script>
```

**3. Using a Package Manager (npm):**

If using npm, you would install it via the command line and then import it into your project.


After including the library, you can start using the touchSwipe functions in your JavaScript code to add swipe functionality to your elements. Refer to the API documentation for details on available functions and options.


## Core Functionality

### Swipe Events

touchSwipe triggers several events based on swipe gestures.  These events are triggered on the element to which the touchSwipe functionality is applied.  The primary events are:

* **`swipe`:**  Fired when a swipe gesture is detected. This is a general swipe event.
* **`swipeLeft`:** Fired when a left-to-right swipe is detected.
* **`swipeRight`:** Fired when a right-to-left swipe is detected.
* **`swipeUp`:** Fired when an upward swipe is detected.
* **`swipeDown`:** Fired when a downward swipe is detected.
* **`swipeStatus`:**  Fired continuously during a swipe gesture, providing real-time status updates (useful for visual feedback).  This event provides data about the swipe's progress.

Each event passes an event object containing relevant data like the swipe direction and distance. Consult the detailed API documentation for the specific properties of each event object.

### Event Handling

Event handling is done using jQuery's standard `on()` method (or the older `bind()` method).  You bind the desired event handler to your element.

For example, to handle a swipeLeft event on an element with the ID "myElement":

```javascript
$('#myElement').on('swipeLeft', function(event){
  console.log("Swipe Left detected!");
  //Your code to handle the swipe left event
});
```

Similarly, you can handle other swipe events (`swipeRight`, `swipeUp`, `swipeDown`, `swipe`) using the appropriate event names.  The `swipeStatus` event allows for more granular control and real-time feedback.

```javascript
$('#myElement').on('swipeStatus', function(event, phase, direction, distance, duration, fingers) {
    // phase: start, move, cancel, end
    // direction: left, right, up, down
    // distance: the distance of the swipe
    // duration: the time of the swipe
    // fingers: the number of fingers used in the swipe
    console.log("Swipe Status:", phase, direction, distance);

    // Example: Show visual feedback based on swipe status
    if (phase === "move") {
      // Update a progress bar or indicator
    }
});

```

### Configuring Swipe Sensitivity

The sensitivity of swipe detection can be adjusted using the `threshold` option.  This option determines the minimum distance (in pixels) the user must swipe before a swipe event is triggered.  A higher threshold makes the detection less sensitive, requiring a larger swipe.

This option is passed as part of the `touchSwipe()` options object.  For instance:

```javascript
$('#myElement').touchSwipe({
  threshold: 100 // Requires a swipe of at least 100 pixels
});
```

### Controlling Swipe Direction

By default, touchSwipe detects swipes in all four directions. However, you can restrict the detection to specific directions using the `allowPageScroll` option. This option takes a string value combining 'vertical' and 'horizontal' to control scroll directions, or 'none' to disable scrolling completely during swipes.

For example, to allow only horizontal swipes:

```javascript
$('#myElement').touchSwipe({
  allowPageScroll: 'vertical' //Only vertical scrolling is allowed
});
```

To disable all scrolling while swiping:
```javascript
$('#myElement').touchSwipe({
  allowPageScroll: 'none'
});
```


### Handling Multiple Gestures

touchSwipe can handle multiple gestures on a single element.  Simply bind multiple event handlers to the element. Each event handler will be triggered independently when the corresponding gesture occurs.

For example:

```javascript
$('#myElement').on('swipeLeft', function(){
  //Handle left swipe
}).on('swipeRight', function(){
  //Handle right swipe
});
```

You can even combine swipe events with other jQuery touch events or mouse events for more complex interactions.  Remember to account for potential conflicts if multiple events could be triggered simultaneously.


## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Swipe Thresholds

While the global `threshold` option sets a minimum swipe distance, you can further refine swipe detection by customizing thresholds for individual directions.  This isn't directly supported by a single option, but can be achieved by checking the `distance` property within the `swipeStatus` event and only acting on swipes that meet specific distance requirements for each direction.

```javascript
$('#myElement').on('swipeStatus', function(event, phase, direction, distance) {
  if (phase === "end") {
    if (direction === "left" && distance > 150) { // Requires a longer swipe left
      // Handle left swipe
    } else if (direction === "right" && distance > 50) { // Shorter swipe right is okay
      // Handle right swipe
    }
  }
});
```

This approach provides granular control over the sensitivity of swipes in different directions.

### Implementing Swipe Triggers

By default, touchSwipe automatically detects swipes. However, you might want to trigger actions based on specific conditions in your application logic, rather than relying solely on the automatic detection.  This is best done using the `swipeStatus` event and conditionally triggering your actions based on the `phase` property.  For example, you might trigger an action only when the swipe ends (`phase === "end"`) and meets certain distance or velocity criteria.


```javascript
let swipeTriggered = false; // Flag to prevent multiple triggers

$('#myElement').on('swipeStatus', function(event, phase, direction, distance) {
  if (phase === "end" && !swipeTriggered) {
    if (direction === "left" && distance > 100) {
      swipeTriggered = true; // Prevent further triggering
      // Perform your action here...
    }
  }
});
```

The `swipeTriggered` flag prevents accidental multiple executions if the `swipeStatus` event triggers multiple times during one swipe.


### Working with Different Finger Counts

touchSwipe can detect gestures using different numbers of fingers. While the default behavior is to react to single-finger swipes, you can potentially filter events based on the `fingers` property within the `swipeStatus` event.  However, direct support for multi-finger gestures beyond basic swipe detection might require a different library or a more complex custom implementation.  You can check the `fingers` property to differentiate single-finger swipes from multi-finger interactions (e.g., pinch-to-zoom).


```javascript
$('#myElement').on('swipeStatus', function(event, phase, direction, distance, duration, fingers){
    if (fingers === 2 && phase === "end") {
        //Handle two-finger swipe (though exact behavior depends on the library implementation)
    } else if (fingers === 1 && phase === "end"){
        // Handle single-finger swipe
    }
});
```


### Handling Edge Swipes

Edge swipes, where the swipe starts near the edge of the element, often require special handling to avoid interfering with the browser's default scroll behavior or other UI elements. You can utilize the `swipeStatus` event to check the starting coordinates of the swipe relative to your element and modify your behavior accordingly.  Consider preventing default actions for edge swipes (see the next section).


### Preventing Default Actions

By default, touchSwipe might trigger browser default actions (like scrolling) when gestures are performed. You can use the `preventDefaultEvents` option to prevent this.

```javascript
$('#myElement').touchSwipe({
    preventDefaultEvents: true
});
```
This prevents the browser from performing its default actions during a swipe, ensuring that your custom handlers take complete control.  Alternatively, you could prevent default actions on a case-by-case basis within the `swipeStatus` event handler using `event.preventDefault()`,  potentially only for edge swipes or specific conditions.  However, using `preventDefaultEvents: true` globally is often simpler for suppressing unwanted browser behavior.


## Integration and Examples

### Integrating with Existing Projects

Integrating touchSwipe into existing projects is generally straightforward.  Ensure jQuery is included in your project *before* including the touchSwipe library.  Then, select the target elements using jQuery selectors and apply the `touchSwipe()` method.  Remember to consider the potential impact on existing event handlers;  you may need to adjust your code to work alongside touchSwipe's event handling.  If conflicts arise, carefully examine the event order and potentially use `event.preventDefault()` judiciously to prevent unwanted default behaviors.


### Basic Example: Single Swipe Gesture

This example demonstrates a basic left-to-right swipe on a div element that changes its background color:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>touchSwipe Example</title>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.touchSwipe.min.js"></script>
<style>
#myElement {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div id="myElement"></div>

<script>
$('#myElement').on('swipeRight', function(){
  $(this).css('background-color', 'lightgreen');
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Remember to replace `"jquery.touchSwipe.min.js"` with the actual path to your touchSwipe library file.


### Example: Multi-directional Swipe Navigation

This example demonstrates multi-directional swipe navigation, changing content based on the swipe direction:


```javascript
$('#navigationContainer').on('swipeLeft', function(){
  // Show next content
}).on('swipeRight', function(){
  // Show previous content
}).on('swipeUp', function(){
  // Show top content
}).on('swipeDown', function(){
  // Show bottom content
});
```

You would need to implement the logic for showing different content within the event handlers (e.g., using hidden elements, dynamically loading content, etc.).


### Example: Pinch-to-Zoom Integration

Direct pinch-to-zoom isn't a core feature of touchSwipe.  To implement pinch-to-zoom, you'll likely need to use a separate library specifically designed for that purpose (or create a custom solution involving touch event handling and transformations).  touchSwipe primarily focuses on swipe gestures.


### Example: Custom Swipe Actions

This example shows how to trigger custom actions based on swipes, going beyond simple visual changes:

```javascript
$('#myElement').on('swipeLeft', function(){
    $.ajax({
        url: 'some_url',
        type: 'GET',
        success: function(data){
            // Handle successful data retrieval
        },
        error: function(error){
            // Handle error
        }
    });
}).on('swipeRight', function(){
    // Perform another custom action here
});
```

This demonstrates triggering an AJAX call on a left swipe, showcasing how touchSwipe can integrate with other functionalities.  Remember to adapt the AJAX URL and error handling to your specific needs.

Remember to adapt these examples to your specific project requirements, HTML structure, and desired functionality.  You'll likely need to incorporate additional CSS and potentially more complex JavaScript logic to fully integrate touchSwipe into your application.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

* **Swipes not detected:**  Ensure that jQuery is included *before* touchSwipe and that the `touchSwipe()` method is correctly applied to your target element(s). Check the selector to make sure it's targeting the correct element.  Inspect your browser's console for any JavaScript errors.  Verify that the element is visible and has appropriate dimensions. Consider adjusting the `threshold` option to reduce sensitivity if swipes are too short.

* **Conflicting event handlers:** If touchSwipe events aren't working as expected, check for any conflicts with existing event handlers attached to the same element.  Use `event.preventDefault()` within your event handlers to prevent default actions that might interfere, or ensure your handlers are correctly ordered and prioritized.

* **Incorrect swipe direction:** Double-check that the event handler (e.g., `swipeLeft`, `swipeRight`) matches the intended swipe direction.  The library interprets the direction based on the swipe's start and end points.

* **Scrolling issues:**  If scrolling behaves unexpectedly, explore the `allowPageScroll` option to control which scrolling directions are allowed during swipes.  Experiment with different values (`vertical`, `horizontal`, `none`) to find the most suitable setting.  If default scrolling is interfering with your swipe gestures, consider using `preventDefaultEvents: true`  in the touchSwipe options.


### Debugging Tips

* **Browser's developer console:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually opened with F12) to inspect the console for JavaScript errors and warnings.  This is crucial for identifying issues related to library inclusion, event binding, or incorrect function calls.

* **`console.log()` statements:** Add `console.log()` statements to your event handlers to track the events being triggered and the values of relevant parameters (like `phase`, `direction`, `distance`, etc.) within the `swipeStatus` event. This helps verify that the events are firing correctly and provides insight into the swipe gesture's details.

* **Simplify your code:** Isolate the problem by creating a minimal, reproducible example.  Remove any unnecessary code to focus on the core functionality causing the issue. This helps pinpoint the source of the problem more easily.

* **Check for jQuery conflicts:** Make sure you aren't experiencing jQuery conflicts with other libraries on your page.  Use different versions of jQuery to test for compatibility, or ensure that your jQuery inclusion is properly managed to avoid conflicting versions.


### Performance Optimization

* **Minimize the number of event handlers:** Avoid attaching unnecessary event handlers, particularly the `swipeStatus` handler, as continuous updates can impact performance.  Only attach event handlers if absolutely necessary for your application's functionality.

* **Optimize selectors:** Ensure that your jQuery selectors are efficient and target elements precisely to avoid unnecessary DOM traversals.  Use appropriate caching mechanisms if you need to access elements repeatedly.

* **Consider alternatives:** For extremely performance-sensitive applications, explore whether a lighter-weight library or a custom implementation might be more suitable. touchSwipe is generally efficient, but in exceptionally demanding situations, you may find a need for optimization.


### Known Limitations

* **Complex gesture recognition:** touchSwipe is primarily focused on simple swipe gestures.  It might not handle complex multi-touch gestures (like rotation or scaling) as robustly as specialized libraries dedicated to such functionality.

* **Browser inconsistencies:** Although touchSwipe strives for cross-browser compatibility, minor inconsistencies might still exist across various browsers and devices due to differences in touch event handling.  Thorough testing across your target platforms is recommended.

* **Older browsers:**  Support for very old browsers might be limited.  Modern browsers are generally recommended for optimal performance and functionality.  You may need polyfills or alternative solutions for older browsers.


## API Reference

This section provides a detailed overview of the touchSwipe API.  Note that the specific properties and methods might vary slightly depending on the version of the library.  Always refer to the latest documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

### touchSwipe() Method

The core function of the library is the `touchSwipe()` method.  It's applied to a jQuery object representing the element(s) to which you want to add swipe functionality.  It takes an options object as an argument to configure the behavior.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
$(selector).touchSwipe(options);
```

* **`selector`:** A jQuery selector targeting the HTML element(s) to enable swipe gestures on.

* **`options`:** An object containing various configuration options (detailed below).  If omitted, default settings are used.


### Event Properties

The events triggered by touchSwipe (e.g., `swipe`, `swipeLeft`, `swipeRight`, `swipeUp`, `swipeDown`, `swipeStatus`) pass an event object as an argument to the event handler function.  This event object contains several useful properties:


* **`event.target`:** The DOM element that triggered the event.

* **`event.type`:** The type of event (e.g., "swipeLeft").

* **`event.originalEvent`:** The original browser touch event.

* **`event.phase` (for `swipeStatus`):**  Indicates the phase of the swipe (e.g., "start", "move", "end", "cancel").

* **`event.direction` (for `swipeStatus`):** The direction of the swipe (e.g., "left", "right", "up", "down").

* **`event.distance` (for `swipeStatus`):** The distance of the swipe in pixels.

* **`event.duration` (for `swipeStatus`):** The duration of the swipe in milliseconds.

* **`event.fingers` (for `swipeStatus`):** The number of fingers used in the swipe.

* **`event.data`:**  Custom data that can be passed when triggering the event.


### Options Configuration

The `touchSwipe()` method accepts an options object to customize its behavior.  Key options include:

* **`threshold`:** The minimum distance (in pixels) required for a swipe to be recognized (default value varies by version, check documentation).

* **`maxTimeThreshold`:** The maximum time (in milliseconds) allowed for a swipe to be recognized. Swipes exceeding this time will be ignored (default value varies, check documentation).

* **`fingers`:**  The number of fingers required for a swipe to be recognized (defaults to 1).

* **`swipe`:** A callback function executed on any swipe.

* **`swipeLeft`:** A callback function executed on a left swipe.

* **`swipeRight`:** A callback function executed on a right swipe.

* **`swipeUp`:** A callback function executed on an upward swipe.

* **`swipeDown`:** A callback function executed on a downward swipe.

* **`swipeStatus`:** A callback function that provides continuous updates during a swipe.

* **`preventDefaultEvents`:** A boolean value indicating whether to prevent default browser events (like scrolling) during swipes (default is usually `false`).

* **`allowPageScroll`:**  A string controlling allowed scrolling directions during swipes ('vertical', 'horizontal', 'none').


### Methods and Properties Overview

While `touchSwipe()` is the primary method,  the library doesn't expose many other public methods or properties directly on the jQuery object after applying `touchSwipe()`.  Its functionality is primarily event-driven.  The configuration is entirely handled through the options passed to `touchSwipe()`.  The primary interaction is through event handlers attached to the target element(s) using jQuery's `on()` or `bind()` methods, responding to the events fired by the library.  The behavior is largely determined through the options you provide during initialization using `touchSwipe()`.
