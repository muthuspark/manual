## Getting Started

### Installation

WOW Slider's installation is straightforward.  First, download the latest version of WOW Slider from [insert download link here].  Extract the downloaded archive to your desired location on your web server.  The extracted folder will contain all necessary files for the slider, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and a sample image folder.  You'll need to upload this entire folder (and its contents) to your web server via FTP or your hosting provider's file manager. Ensure that the folder and all its files have the appropriate permissions for your web server to access them.  After uploading, you'll need to adjust paths and settings within the configuration file (as detailed below) to match your website's structure.


### Basic Configuration

The core configuration of WOW Slider is managed through a single JSON configuration file typically named `slider.json`. This file contains settings that control various aspects of the slider, such as:

* **`width` and `height`:** Define the dimensions of the slider.  Adjust these values to fit your website's layout.
* **`images`:** An array of objects specifying paths to your slider images.  Each object typically contains a `url` property (path to the image file relative to the slider's directory) and optionally other properties like `title` and `description` for captions.
* **`effect`:**  Specifies the transition effect to use between slides. WOW Slider provides a variety of effects; consult the [Effects Reference](insert link here) for a complete list.
* **`interval`:** Controls the time (in milliseconds) between automatic slide transitions. Set to `0` to disable automatic transitions.
* **`controls`:** Enables or disables navigation controls (arrows, thumbnails, etc.).

A basic `slider.json` might look like this:

```json
{
  "width": 600,
  "height": 400,
  "images": [
    { "url": "images/image1.jpg", "title": "Image 1" },
    { "url": "images/image2.jpg", "title": "Image 2" },
    { "url": "images/image3.jpg", "title": "Image 3" }
  ],
  "effect": "fade",
  "interval": 5000
}
```

Remember to replace `"images/image1.jpg"`, `"images/image2.jpg"`, and `"images/image3.jpg"` with the actual paths to your images.


### First Slider Example

To create your first slider, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your images:** Place your images (e.g., `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`) into a subfolder named `images` within your WOW Slider directory.
2. **Create or modify `slider.json`:** Create a `slider.json` file (or modify the existing one)  with the image paths and settings as described in the "Basic Configuration" section.  Ensure the paths are correct relative to the `slider.json` file's location.
3. **Include the slider in your HTML:**  Insert the following code into your webpage's HTML where you want the slider to appear.  Adjust the path to `engine/slider.html` if necessary:

```html
<div id="wowslider-container">
<div id="wowslider-outer">
<div id="wowslider">
<div id="wows1-loading" style="position:absolute; top:50%; left:50%; margin:-22px 0 0 -22px; display:block;">Loading...</div>
<div id="wows1_arrow_left" class="ws_arrow"><span></span></div>
<div id="wows1_arrow_right" class="ws_arrow"><span></span></div>
</div>
<div id="wowslider-bot"></div>
<div id="ws_shadow"></div>
</div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="engine/wowslider.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="engine/script.js"></script>
```

4. **Test your slider:** Open your webpage in a web browser.  If everything is configured correctly, your WOW Slider should display your images. If you encounter errors, carefully check the file paths in `slider.json` and ensure that all the necessary files are correctly uploaded to your web server.


## Slider Settings

### General Settings

General settings in `slider.json` control the overall appearance and behavior of your WOW Slider. Key settings include:

* **`width` and `height`:**  Specify the slider's dimensions in pixels.  These values determine the initial size of the slider; responsive settings (discussed below) handle adjustments for different screen sizes.
* **`interval`:** Sets the time (in milliseconds) between automatic slide transitions.  A value of `0` disables auto-transitioning.
* **`autoPlay`:** A boolean value (`true` or `false`) to enable or disable automatic slideshow playback.  This setting overrides the `interval` setting if set to `false`.
* **`preload`:**  Determines how many images are preloaded before the slider starts.  Higher values improve initial loading time but increase initial resource consumption.
* **`loop`:** A boolean value indicating whether the slideshow should loop continuously (`true`) or stop after the last slide (`false`).
* **`stopOnHover`:** A boolean value controlling whether the slideshow pauses when the mouse hovers over the slider (`true`) or continues playing (`false`).
* **`background`:** Allows you to specify a background color or image for the slider container.  This can be a hex color code (e.g., `"#FFFFFF"` for white) or a URL to an image.

### Image Settings

Image-related settings control how images are displayed and handled within the slider:

* **`images`:** This is an array of objects, where each object represents a single slide. Each object *must* contain a `url` property specifying the path to the image file (relative to the `slider.json` file's location).  Optional properties include:
    * **`title`:**  The title of the slide, often used for captions.
    * **`description`:** A longer description for the slide.
    * **`link`:**  A URL to link the image to.
    * **`target`:**  The target for the link (e.g., `"_blank"` to open in a new tab).

* **`imageQuality`:** Controls the JPEG image quality (if applicable).  A higher value results in better quality but larger file sizes.


### Navigation Settings

Navigation settings control the elements users interact with to navigate the slider:

* **`controls`:** A boolean value (`true` or `false`) that enables or disables navigation controls altogether.
* **`bullets`:** A boolean value (`true` or `false`) enabling or disabling bullet navigation.
* **`thumbs`:** A boolean value enabling or disabling thumbnail navigation.
* **`playPause`:** A boolean value (`true` or `false`) to show/hide the play/pause button.
* **`keyboardNavigation`:** A boolean value controlling whether keyboard arrows can navigate the slider.


### Effects Settings

These settings determine the visual transitions between slides:

* **`effect`:** Specifies the transition effect to use.  WOW Slider offers a variety of effects (e.g., `fade`, `slide`, `crossfade`). Consult the [Effects Reference](insert link here) for available options.  You can often combine effects by using array notation e.g., `["fade", "zoom"]` to create more complex transitions.
* **`duration`:** The duration (in milliseconds) of the transition effect.


### Responsive Settings

Responsive settings ensure your slider adapts to different screen sizes:

* **`responsive`:** A boolean value (`true` or `false`) enabling or disabling responsive behavior.
* **`responsiveSizes`:** An array of objects defining breakpoints and corresponding slider dimensions for different screen sizes.  Each object would typically include properties like `width`, `height`, and `maxWidth` (or similar) to control the slider's appearance at different resolutions.  For example:

```json
"responsiveSizes":[
    {"width":600,"height":400},
    {"width":800,"height":600, "maxWidth": 1024},
    {"width":1200,"height":800}
]
```

### Accessibility Settings

Accessibility settings ensure your slider is usable by everyone:

* **`accessible`:** A boolean value (`true` or `false`) to enable or disable keyboard and screen reader support.  Enabling this is strongly recommended for inclusivity.
* **`altText`:**  Consider adding alternative text descriptions to your image objects (within the `images` array) to describe the image for screen readers.  This is crucial for accessibility.  (e.g.  `"alt": "A beautiful landscape image"`).  The slider will use this text when `accessible` is enabled.




## Advanced Features

### Customizing the Slider's Appearance

Beyond the basic settings in `slider.json`, you can extensively customize WOW Slider's appearance using CSS.  The main stylesheet is typically located at `engine/style.css`.  You can create a custom CSS file and link it to your HTML to override default styles.  Target specific elements using their ID or class names (e.g., `#wowslider`, `.ws_arrow`, `.ws_bullets`).  Remember to be mindful of specificity when writing your CSS to ensure your styles override the existing ones correctly. Consider using the browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and identify the appropriate classes or IDs to target.  You can also modify the HTML structure (though this is generally less recommended unless absolutely necessary), but always back up your files before making any direct modifications to the core WOW Slider files.


### Adding Thumbnails

WOW Slider supports thumbnail navigation. Enable thumbnails by setting the `thumbs` property to `true` in your `slider.json` file.  The slider will automatically generate thumbnails based on your images.  However, you can customize their appearance using CSS, targeting elements with classes like `.ws_thumbs` and related classes.  You might need to adjust the size and layout of the thumbnail container to fit your design. The location and style of the thumbnails can be controlled through CSS.


### Using the API

WOW Slider provides a JavaScript API allowing you to control the slider programmatically.  You can use functions like `wowSlider.start()`, `wowSlider.stop()`, `wowSlider.goToSlide(index)`, and others to interact with the slider.  These functions are documented in detail within the [API Reference](insert link here).  For example, to go to the third slide, you would use:  `wowSlider.goToSlide(2);` (remember that indexing starts at 0).


### Integrating with Other Libraries

Integrating WOW Slider with other JavaScript libraries usually involves careful consideration of potential conflicts.  Ensure that the libraries are loaded in the correct order, and check for any naming conflicts (e.g., using different variable names to avoid collisions).  Consider using a module bundler like Webpack if you are working with many different libraries to manage dependencies effectively.  Pay close attention to library initialization and ensure that it occurs after the WOW Slider is fully loaded to avoid timing issues and conflicts with other scripts.


### Handling Events

WOW Slider triggers various events during its operation, allowing you to respond to changes in the slider's state. These events can be useful to add additional functionality to your website such as animations or custom actions.  For example, you can listen for the `beforeChange` event to trigger an animation before a slide transition or the `afterChange` event to display associated content.  Refer to the [Events Reference](insert link here) for a list of available events and how to handle them.  These events are typically accessed using the WOW Slider API.


### Troubleshooting and Common Issues

**Blank Slider:** This often happens due to incorrect image paths in `slider.json`. Double-check that the paths are relative to the location of `slider.json` and that the images exist.

**Slider Not Responsive:** Ensure that the `responsive` setting in `slider.json` is set to `true` and that the `responsiveSizes` array is correctly configured.

**Conflicting Styles:**  CSS conflicts with other parts of your website may alter the slider's appearance.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect and troubleshoot conflicting styles.

**JavaScript Errors:**  Examine the browser's developer console for JavaScript errors, which often pinpoint problems in your code or conflicts with other libraries.

**Missing Files:**  Verify that all necessary WOW Slider files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are uploaded correctly to your server.  Check file permissions to ensure the web server has access to them.

If you encounter issues not resolved by these suggestions, consult the [FAQ](insert link here) or contact WOW Slider support.


## Themes and Skins

### Applying Predefined Themes

WOW Slider offers a range of predefined themes to quickly change the slider's visual style.  These themes typically consist of CSS files that modify the slider's appearance.  To apply a predefined theme, you'll generally need to locate the theme's CSS file (often within a `themes` directory within the WOW Slider installation) and link it to your HTML page.  This is usually done by adding a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML, replacing the path with the actual path to your chosen theme's CSS file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="themes/theme-name/style.css">
```

Replace `"themes/theme-name/style.css"` with the correct path to your theme's CSS file. Some themes may require additional files or modifications to your `slider.json` for complete functionality. Consult the specific theme's documentation if available.


### Creating Custom Themes

Creating custom themes involves modifying the existing CSS or creating a new CSS file to style the slider's components.  Start by inspecting the default CSS file (usually `engine/style.css` or a similar file depending on your WOW Slider version) to understand the structure and classes used.  Create a new CSS file (e.g., `my-custom-theme.css`) and add your custom styles.  You'll target specific elements using their CSS classes or IDs (e.g.,  `.ws_arrow`, `.ws_bullets`,  `.ws_caption`).  Remember to link your custom CSS file to your HTML page, ensuring it's linked *after* the default WOW Slider CSS to override the default styles as needed.


### Understanding Theme Structure

A WOW Slider theme typically consists of one or more CSS files which define styles for different slider elements.  The CSS classes often follow a naming convention to clearly indicate the element being styled (e.g.,  classes starting with `ws_` often pertain to WOW Slider).  These CSS files define the appearance of:

* **Navigation elements:** Arrows, bullets, thumbnails, play/pause buttons.
* **Slider container:** Overall dimensions, background, and borders.
* **Caption elements:**  The style of text displayed above or below the images.
* **Loading indicators:** The style of the loading message during initial slider loading.

Inspecting the default CSS and the structure of existing themes will help you understand which styles to target when creating or modifying your own themes.  Pay attention to selectors and specificity to avoid unintended style overrides.  Using your browser's developer tools is essential for this process to understand the hierarchy of styles applied to different elements and to identify the CSS classes to customize.


## Examples and Use Cases

### Showcase Slider Example

A showcase slider is ideal for highlighting key features, products, or services on a website's homepage or landing page.  To create this, focus on high-quality images and concise captions that emphasize the benefits of each showcased item.  Consider using a fade or subtle slide transition effect. The `slider.json` would contain a list of image objects, each with a `title` and `description` property. For instance:

```json
{
  "width": 1200,
  "height": 600,
  "images": [
    { "url": "images/showcase1.jpg", "title": "Feature 1", "description": "Description of Feature 1." },
    { "url": "images/showcase2.jpg", "title": "Feature 2", "description": "Description of Feature 2." },
    { "url": "images/showcase3.jpg", "title": "Feature 3", "description": "Description of Feature 3." }
  ],
  "effect": "fade",
  "interval": 7000,
  "controls": true
}
```

Use a clean and visually appealing theme, ensuring the slider complements the overall website design.  Consider adding links to relevant pages within the `link` property of the image objects.


### Product Slider Example

A product slider is suitable for showcasing multiple products on an e-commerce website or product page.  Each slide would typically feature a product image, name, and a brief description, possibly including a "Buy Now" button. The `link` property in `slider.json` would be crucial to link each image to its corresponding product page.  For example:


```json
{
  "width": 800,
  "height": 400,
  "images": [
    { "url": "images/product1.jpg", "title": "Product 1", "description": "A great product!", "link": "product1.html" },
    { "url": "images/product2.jpg", "title": "Product 2", "description": "Another great product!", "link": "product2.html" },
    { "url": "images/product3.jpg", "title": "Product 3", "description": "Yet another great product!", "link": "product3.html" }
  ],
  "effect": "slide",
  "interval": 5000,
  "controls": true,
  "thumbnails": true
}
```

Ensure the images are high-quality and accurately represent the products.  Consider using a theme that emphasizes product details.


### Image Gallery Example

An image gallery slider can present a collection of images, perhaps from an event or a portfolio.  In this case, the emphasis is on visual appeal and a smooth transition between images.  Captions might be less prominent, perhaps showing only the image title or a short description.  You could opt for a more visually dynamic effect like a crossfade or a more complex transition.


```json
{
  "width": 1000,
  "height": 700,
  "images": [
    { "url": "images/gallery1.jpg", "title": "Gallery Image 1" },
    { "url": "images/gallery2.jpg", "title": "Gallery Image 2" },
    { "url": "images/gallery3.jpg", "title": "Gallery Image 3" }
  ],
  "effect": "crossfade",
  "interval": 6000,
  "controls": true,
  "bullets": true
}
```

Choose a theme that allows images to be the focal point.  Using thumbnail navigation might be particularly useful for image galleries to allow quick browsing.  Consider adding lightbox functionality for larger image views.


## API Reference

This section details the JavaScript API for interacting with WOW Slider.  Remember that the specific API methods and properties might vary slightly depending on the version of WOW Slider you are using.  Always consult the documentation for your specific version for the most accurate and up-to-date information.


### Methods

WOW Slider exposes several methods to control its behavior.  These methods are typically accessed through the `wowSlider` global object after the slider has been initialized.

* **`wowSlider.start()`:** Starts the automatic slideshow.

* **`wowSlider.stop()`:** Stops the automatic slideshow.

* **`wowSlider.goToSlide(index)`:**  Navigates to the slide at the specified index (0-based).

* **`wowSlider.next()`:**  Moves to the next slide.

* **`wowSlider.prev()`:** Moves to the previous slide.

* **`wowSlider.play()`:** Starts the slideshow if it's paused.

* **`wowSlider.pause()`:** Pauses the slideshow if it's playing.

* **`wowSlider.getcurrentslide()`:** Returns the index of the currently displayed slide (0-based).

* **`wowSlider.gettotalSlides()`:** Returns the total number of slides in the slider.

* **`wowSlider.destroy()`:** Destroys the slider instance, removing it from the DOM.  Use this carefully as it removes the slider completely.


* **`wowSlider.addSlide(slideData)`:** Adds a new slide to the slider. `slideData` should be an object following the structure used in the `images` array of the `slider.json` file.


* **`wowSlider.removeSlide(index)`:** Removes a slide from the slider at the specified index (0-based).



### Properties

While fewer direct properties are exposed for modification, some properties can be accessed to retrieve information about the slider's state.

* **`wowSlider.currentSlide`:** (Read-only) Returns the index of the currently displayed slide (0-based).  This is functionally equivalent to `wowSlider.getCurrentSlide()`.

* **`wowSlider.totalSlides`:** (Read-only) Returns the total number of slides.  This is functionally equivalent to `wowSlider.getTotalSlides()`.


### Events

WOW Slider triggers various events that you can listen for to integrate custom functionality.  These events are usually handled by attaching event listeners using standard JavaScript `addEventListener` methods, targeting the WOW Slider container element or potentially using the API in newer versions.  Refer to the specific WOW Slider version's documentation for details on how to attach event listeners.  The list of events may vary by version. Some common events include:

* **`beforeChange`:** Triggered before a slide transition occurs.  You can use this to perform actions *before* the slide changes.

* **`afterChange`:** Triggered after a slide transition is complete.  Use this to perform actions *after* the slide change.

* **`start`:** Triggered when the automatic slideshow starts.

* **`stop`:** Triggered when the automatic slideshow stops.

* **`play`:** Triggered when the slideshow is resumed from a paused state.

* **`pause`:** Triggered when the slideshow is paused.


Remember to consult the official WOW Slider documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive API reference for your specific version.  The examples provided here are illustrative and may not cover all available methods, properties, or events.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

This section lists common errors encountered when using WOW Slider and suggests troubleshooting steps.

* **Blank Slider:**  The most frequent issue.  Verify:
    * **Image Paths:** Double-check the `url` properties within the `images` array in `slider.json`. Ensure the paths are correct relative to the location of the `slider.json` file.  Incorrect paths are the most common cause of a blank slider.
    * **Image Existence:** Confirm that all specified images exist in the correct location on your server.
    * **File Permissions:** Ensure your web server has the necessary permissions to access the image files and the `slider.json` file.
    * **Typos:** Carefully check for typos in file names and paths.

* **Slider Not Responsive:**
    * **`responsive` Setting:** Make sure the `responsive` setting in `slider.json` is set to `true`.
    * **`responsiveSizes` Array:** Check the `responsiveSizes` array in `slider.json` to ensure it's correctly configured for various screen sizes.  Incorrect values here can prevent proper responsiveness.
    * **CSS Conflicts:** Conflicting CSS rules might override responsive styles.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect CSS and identify any conflicts.

* **JavaScript Errors:** Examine your browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12) for JavaScript errors.  These errors often pinpoint problematic code, conflicts between JavaScript libraries, or issues loading the WOW Slider scripts.

* **Slider Not Appearing:**  Check:
    * **HTML Inclusion:** Ensure you've correctly included the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your webpage, as described in the installation instructions.
    * **File Paths:** Verify all file paths (HTML, CSS, JS, and images) are correctly specified.
    * **Conflicting IDs:** Make sure that the IDs used in the slider HTML (`wowslider-container`, etc.) don't conflict with other elements on your page.


* **Incorrect Captions or Links:**  Double-check the `title`, `description`, and `link` properties within the `images` array in `slider.json`.  Ensure that links are correctly formatted.

* **Theme Issues:** If using a custom theme, ensure that the CSS is correctly linked and that there aren't any conflicts with the default styles or other CSS on your page.


### Debugging Techniques

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of your slider.  The "Console" tab will show JavaScript errors, and the "Network" tab helps you check if resources are loading correctly.  The "Elements" tab allows you to inspect the structure and CSS of the slider.

* **Console Logging:**  Add `console.log()` statements to your JavaScript code to track the values of variables and check the execution flow. This is helpful in identifying where errors might be occurring, especially if you have added custom JavaScript code to interact with the slider.

* **Simplify:**  If you have a complex slider setup, try simplifying it to isolate the problem.  Remove custom CSS, JavaScript, or extra images to see if the issue persists.  This helps pinpoint whether the problem is within your custom code or in the core WOW Slider functionality.

* **Check for Conflicts:**  If you are using other JavaScript libraries, check for conflicts.  Try loading the libraries in different orders or disabling other libraries temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.



### Browser Compatibility

WOW Slider generally supports modern browsers.  However, very old or outdated browsers might not render the slider correctly or experience performance issues.  It’s important to always test your website on various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and provide a consistent user experience. While WOW Slider strives for broad compatibility, very old browsers might lack support for some CSS features or JavaScript functionalities used by the slider.  It’s generally recommended to test with the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and consider using polyfills for features that might not be supported in older browsers if absolute compatibility with such browsers is required.
