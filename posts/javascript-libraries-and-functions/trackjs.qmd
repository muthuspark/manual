## Getting Started

### Installation

TrackJS integrates seamlessly into your applications via a small JavaScript snippet.  The installation method varies slightly depending on your application's framework and build process.  Generally, you'll need to include the TrackJS script in your HTML, typically within the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag.

**For most applications:** You'll obtain your unique application key from your TrackJS dashboard after creating a new application.  Then include the following script, replacing `YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY` with your key:

```html
<script src="https://d16ntop171648.cloudfront.net/trackjs/track.js"></script>
<script>
  trackJs.configure({
    token: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY'
  });
</script>
```

**Using a Package Manager (npm or yarn):** While not strictly necessary for basic integration, using a package manager can streamline the process and help manage updates.  Currently, there's no official npm package, but you can still easily use the CDN method above.

**Important Considerations:** Ensure the TrackJS script is loaded *after* your main application JavaScript files to ensure proper error capturing.  For optimal performance, consider placing it asynchronously (though not strictly required).

### Configuration

Beyond the application token, TrackJS offers extensive configuration options allowing customization to your specific needs. These options are set via the `trackJs.configure()` method.  Key configuration settings include:

* **`token` (required):** Your unique application key.
* **`application`:**  A string identifying your application (useful for filtering data in the dashboard).
* **`user`:** An object containing user information (e.g., `email`, `id`). This helps contextualize errors.
* **`custom`:** An object allowing you to add your own custom data to error reports.  This is extremely useful for including debugging information or relevant context.
* **`console`:** A boolean controlling whether errors are logged to the browser's console.
* **`samplingRate`:**  A number between 0 and 1 representing the percentage of errors to be captured and sent to TrackJS.  Useful for reducing data volume on high-traffic applications.


Example of advanced configuration:

```javascript
trackJs.configure({
  token: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY',
  application: 'My Awesome App',
  user: { email: 'user@example.com', id: 123 },
  custom: { environment: 'production', version: '1.2.3' },
  console: false,
  samplingRate: 0.1 // 10% sampling
});
```

Refer to the full API documentation for a complete list of configuration options.


### First Application

The simplest application to demonstrate TrackJS is a single HTML file with some JavaScript that intentionally throws an error.  Create a file named `index.html` with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>TrackJS Example</title>
  <script src="https://d16ntop171648.cloudfront.net/trackjs/track.js"></script>
  <script>
    trackJs.configure({ token: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY' });

    function myFunction() {
      throw new Error("This is a test error!");
    }

    myFunction();
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>TrackJS Example</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY` with your actual key. Open this file in your browser.  The error should be caught by TrackJS and displayed in your TrackJS dashboard.

6. **Monitor errors in your TrackJS dashboard:** Log in to your TrackJS dashboard to view, analyze, and debug the captured errors.


## Core Concepts

### Error Tracking

TrackJS's core functionality centers around robust error tracking.  It captures JavaScript exceptions, AJAX errors, and unhandled promise rejections, providing detailed information to help developers quickly identify and resolve issues.  This goes beyond simple stack traces, including:

* **Detailed Stack Traces:**  Provides a complete call stack, pinpointing the exact line of code causing the error.
* **Network Request Details:** For AJAX errors, it captures information about the request (URL, method, headers, response).
* **Browser Context:**  It gathers data about the user's browser, operating system, and screen resolution, aiding in identifying browser-specific bugs.
* **User Context (Optional):** By configuring user information, you can associate errors with specific users, enabling easier debugging and prioritization.
* **Custom Data:**  Add your own custom data to error reports for extra context relevant to your application's state.
* **Error Grouping:**  Similar errors are automatically grouped together, reducing noise and helping you focus on distinct issues.
* **Source Maps Support:** TrackJS supports source maps allowing errors to be displayed in their original, unminified source code, greatly simplifying debugging.


### Performance Monitoring

TrackJS extends beyond error tracking to provide insights into your application's performance. By monitoring key metrics such as page load times and long tasks, it helps identify performance bottlenecks.  This performance monitoring enables you to proactively address slowdowns and improve the user experience.  Key features include:

* **Page Load Time Monitoring:**  Track the overall time taken to load your application's pages.
* **Long Task Detection:**  Identifies long-running JavaScript tasks that could be impacting responsiveness.
* **Performance Metrics Aggregation:**  Provides aggregated performance data, showing trends over time.
* **Integration with other tools:**  Potentially integrates with other performance monitoring tools for a holistic view.  (Check current capabilities on the TrackJS website).


### User Session Tracking

While not directly providing a full session recording, TrackJS provides valuable context through user-level data associated with errors and performance issues. By incorporating user identifiers in your configuration, you can see which users experienced particular errors or slowdowns, aiding in understanding user impact and prioritizing fixes.  This helps target problem areas related to specific user workflows or segments.

### Data Collection

TrackJS collects error and performance data responsibly.  The amount of data collected can be controlled via the `samplingRate` configuration option.  Data collected includes:

* **Error Details:**  Stack trace, error message, browser information, user data (if provided).
* **Performance Metrics:** Page load times, long task durations.
* **User Context (Optional):**  User identifiers, session details.
* **Custom Data (Optional):**  Any data you explicitly add through configuration.

TrackJS's privacy policy should be carefully reviewed to understand its data handling practices.

### Application Insights

Through the combination of error tracking and performance monitoring, TrackJS provides comprehensive insights into your application's health and performance.  These insights help you:

* **Identify and fix bugs:** Quickly locate and resolve errors impacting your users.
* **Improve application performance:**  Pinpoint performance bottlenecks and optimize your code.
* **Enhance user experience:** By addressing errors and performance issues, you directly improve the overall user experience.
* **Proactive problem solving:**  TrackJS allows you to anticipate problems *before* they impact a large number of users.
* **Prioritize development efforts:**  Focus on the issues most affecting your users.


The dashboard provides various visualizations and filtering options, making it easy to analyze the data and gain valuable insights into your application's behavior.


## API Reference

### `trackJs.configure()`

The core configuration method.  Use this to set various options affecting how TrackJS collects and reports data.  All options are set as key-value pairs within an object.

**Parameters:**

* `options` (object): An object containing configuration options.  See the [Configuration](link-to-configuration-section-if-applicable) section for a complete list of available options.

**Example:**

```javascript
trackJs.configure({
  token: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY',
  application: 'My App',
  user: { id: 123, email: 'user@example.com' }
});
```

**Return Value:**  `undefined`


### `trackJs.add()`

This method is generally **not recommended for direct use**. It's primarily used internally by TrackJS to manage error contexts and should not be called explicitly by developers.


### `trackJs.remove()`

Similar to `trackJs.add()`, this method is **generally not recommended for direct use** and is primarily used internally by TrackJS.


### `trackJs.notify()`

This method allows you to manually send a message to the TrackJS server, useful for logging custom events or application state information.  This doesn't capture an error in the same way as `trackJs.capture()`, but adds a custom message to the context of your application's activity.

**Parameters:**

* `message` (string): The message to send.
* `data` (object, optional):  Additional data to include with the message.

**Example:**

```javascript
trackJs.notify('User logged in', { userId: 123 });
```

**Return Value:** `undefined`



### `trackJs.capture()`

This method allows you to manually capture and report an error to TrackJS. Useful for handling errors that might not be automatically caught by TrackJS's built-in exception handling.

**Parameters:**

* `error` (Error): A JavaScript `Error` object representing the error.
* `message` (string, optional): An optional message to accompany the error.
* `data` (object, optional):  Optional additional data to include with the error report.

**Example:**

```javascript
try {
  // Some code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  trackJs.capture(error, 'Custom error message', {context: 'specific function'});
}
```

**Return Value:** `undefined`


### `trackJs.send()`

This method forces TrackJS to immediately send any pending error reports to the server.  Generally, TrackJS handles sending asynchronously, so this method is usually unnecessary.  However, it can be useful in situations where you need to guarantee data is sent before closing a connection or unloading a page.

**Parameters:** None

**Example:**

```javascript
trackJs.send();
```

**Return Value:** `undefined`


### Event Handling

TrackJS doesn't directly expose an API for handling specific error events within your application code.  Error handling is largely implicit; the library catches and reports errors automatically.  The configuration options, including custom data, provide control over what context is included in reports.


### Custom Error Handling

While TrackJS automatically captures many errors, you can add custom error handling to provide additional context or to handle specific errors differently. This typically involves using a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors, adding any relevant information to `trackJs.capture()` before re-throwing the error (if appropriate):


```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  const customData = {
    userInput: document.getElementById('user-input').value,
    action: 'button click'
  };
  trackJs.capture(error, 'Custom Error Context', customData);
  //Optionally rethrow if you want to handle the error in another way.  Consider the implications of rethrowing vs. not.
  //throw error; 
}
```

Remember that even with custom handling, TrackJS will still attempt to catch any errors that escape your `try...catch` blocks.


## Integrations

### Integrating with Popular Frameworks

TrackJS is designed to be framework-agnostic, working effectively with most JavaScript frameworks.  While there isn't framework-specific SDKs, the core JavaScript snippet integrates easily into most environments. The key is ensuring the TrackJS script is loaded correctly within your application's lifecycle.

**General Approach:** The standard integration method involves adding the TrackJS script tag to your HTML, typically within the `<head>` or before the closing `</body>` tag.

**React, Angular, Vue, etc.:**  These frameworks typically handle JavaScript loading within their build process.  Include the TrackJS script in your HTML template or your main application file according to your framework's best practices.  Pay attention to the timing of the script's inclusion to ensure it executes *after* your application's JavaScript.


**Specific Framework Considerations:**

* **Build Processes:**  Some build tools might minify or obfuscate your code, which could affect how TrackJS reports errors.  Ensure your source maps are correctly configured if you're using a build process.
* **Modular Architectures:**  If you use a modular architecture, ensure the TrackJS script is loaded in a central location that all your modules have access to.
* **Testing:**  In development or testing environments, you may want to adjust the `samplingRate` configuration option to reduce the volume of data sent to your TrackJS dashboard.


### Custom Integrations

If you need to integrate TrackJS with a custom system or a less common framework, the flexibility of the TrackJS API allows for considerable customization.  You could create a custom wrapper or integrate it into your existing logging or error-handling mechanisms.

The core interaction point is the `trackJs.capture()` method, which allows you to manually send error information to TrackJS.  You can send additional data providing context relevant to your custom environment.  This will require a deeper understanding of your system's architecture and error handling flows.


### Server-Side Integrations

TrackJS is primarily focused on client-side JavaScript error tracking.  There's no direct server-side integration provided by TrackJS itself.  While you can't send server-side errors directly to TrackJS, you can integrate your server-side logging with a separate system and potentially correlate server-side events with client-side errors reported by TrackJS via shared identifiers like user IDs or session tokens.  This may require custom logic to link server-side error logs and TrackJS data for a holistic view of application behavior.


## Advanced Usage

### Custom Error Reporting

Beyond the automatic error capture, TrackJS allows for highly customized error reporting.  This involves using `trackJs.capture()` to explicitly report errors, adding context beyond what's automatically collected. This is crucial for scenarios where you need to include specific data relevant to the application's state or user interaction that TrackJS might not otherwise capture.  Remember that even with custom reporting, TrackJS's built-in error handling remains active, catching any unhandled exceptions.


### Custom Data Attributes

Enrich your error reports with custom data attributes using the `custom` property in `trackJs.configure()` or as part of the `data` parameter in `trackJs.capture()`.  This allows you to include application-specific information crucial for debugging, such as user IDs, session IDs, feature flags, or other relevant contextual details.   Careful planning of what data to include is essential, balancing the value of the additional context with data privacy and security considerations.


### Filtering and Tagging

TrackJS's dashboard provides robust filtering capabilities to efficiently analyze error data.  You can filter by error message, browser, operating system, application version, and custom attributes.  Effectively using custom data attributes (as described above) enhances filtering capabilities, allowing you to isolate errors affecting specific user segments or application features.  The ability to effectively tag and filter errors is critical for managing and prioritizing error resolution in complex applications.


### User Privacy

Protecting user privacy is paramount. When using TrackJS, carefully consider the data you include in error reports.  Avoid including sensitive personal information (PII) such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or precise geolocation data.  If you need to include identifying information, consider using anonymized or hashed versions where possible.  Review and comply with all relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and TrackJS's own privacy policy.


### Data Security

TrackJS employs industry-standard security measures to protect the data it collects.  However, it's essential to be mindful of the security implications of the data you include in error reports.  Avoid including sensitive API keys, database credentials, or other security-sensitive information. Use appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms within your application to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.  Refer to TrackJS's security documentation for detailed information on their security practices.


### Rate Limiting

To prevent overwhelming the TrackJS servers and to manage data volume, TrackJS may employ rate limiting.  While generally not an issue for typical applications, extremely high volumes of errors could trigger rate limiting.  If you're experiencing high error rates, consider using the `samplingRate` configuration option to reduce the number of errors sent to TrackJS.  This reduces the load on the service while still providing a representative sample of errors for analysis.  Contact TrackJS support if you believe you are encountering issues due to rate limiting.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **No errors appearing in the dashboard:**  Double-check that you've correctly entered your application token in `trackJs.configure()`. Ensure the TrackJS script is included correctly in your HTML and is loaded after your application's JavaScript. Check your network settings to ensure your application can reach the TrackJS servers.  Verify that the `samplingRate` isn't set to 0, effectively disabling error reporting.

* **Errors appear as "Uncaught Error" with no stack trace:** This often indicates that the error occurred before TrackJS had a chance to fully initialize.  Ensure the TrackJS script is loaded early in your HTML (ideally before other scripts).

* **Incorrect or incomplete error details:**  Verify that your source maps are correctly configured if you're using minified or bundled JavaScript.  Incomplete stack traces might also indicate issues with your JavaScript code or browser compatibility.

* **High error volume overwhelming the dashboard:**  Reduce the data volume using the `samplingRate` configuration option to a value like 0.1 (10%) for production environments.


### Debugging Tips

* **Console Logging:**  Add `console.log` statements at various points in your code to track execution flow and identify potential error locations.

* **Browser Developer Tools:**  Use your browser's developer tools (Network, Console, Sources tabs) to examine network requests, console logs, and the call stack of errors.

* **Simplify the Code:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the cause of the issue. This helps identify if the problem is with your application code or a conflict with TrackJS.

* **Check for Conflicts:** Ensure there are no conflicts between TrackJS and other JavaScript libraries used in your application.

* **Test Environment:**  Replicate the issue in a controlled testing environment to better understand the context in which the error occurs.


### Troubleshooting Errors

When encountering errors, start by examining the details provided in the TrackJS dashboard.  Pay close attention to:

* **Error Message:**  The description of the error.
* **Stack Trace:** The sequence of function calls leading to the error.
