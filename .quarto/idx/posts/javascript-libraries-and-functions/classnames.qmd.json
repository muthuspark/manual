It takes an arbitrary number of arguments and returns a space-separated string of class names. This simplifies the process of generating class strings based on different states or props.  It eliminates the need for verbose `if/else` statements or ternary operators when constructing class name strings.\n\n### Why Use Classnames?\n\nUsing `classnames` offers several advantages:\n\n* **Readability:**  Makes your code cleaner and easier to read, particularly when dealing with complex conditional logic for class names.  Long, nested conditional statements are replaced with concise function calls.\n\n* **Maintainability:**  Simplifies the process of updating and maintaining your class names. Changes to styling are localized and less likely to introduce errors.\n\n* **Reusability:**  Allows for the creation of reusable class name functions that can be used throughout your application.\n\n* **Performance:**  While extremely efficient, `classnames` keeps performance overhead minimal compared to the verbose alternatives it replaces.\n\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\nThe easiest way to install `classnames` is using npm or yarn:\n\n**npm:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install classnames\n```\n\n**yarn:**\n\n```bash\nyarn add classnames\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can import it into your JavaScript files:\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n```\n\nor if you are using ES6 modules:\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames/bind'; // for binding to a prefix or other advanced functionality (see docs).\n```\n\n\n### Basic Usage Examples\n\nHere are some basic examples showcasing the functionality of `classnames`:\n\n**Example 1: Simple conditional class**\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst isHighlighted = true;\nconst myClass = classNames('base-class', { highlighted: isHighlighted });\nconsole.log(myClass); // Output: \"base-class highlighted\"\n\nconst isDisabled = false;\nconst myOtherClass = classNames('button', { disabled: isDisabled, active: true});\nconsole.log(myOtherClass); // Output: \"button active\"\n```\n\nIn this example,  `highlighted` is only added if `isHighlighted` is true.\n\n\n**Example 2: Multiple classes**\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst className = classNames('container', 'row', 'justify-content-center');\nconsole.log(className); // Output: \"container row justify-content-center\"\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates adding multiple classes directly.\n\n\n**Example 3: Using an array of classes**\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst size = 'large';\nconst alignment = ['left', 'text-align-center']; //Note that this allows for multiple values in the array\nconst myClass = classNames('text', size, alignment);\nconsole.log(myClass); // Output: \"text large left text-align-center\"\n```\n\nThis shows how to combine string and array arguments. Note that arrays are flattened and all values added.\n\n\n**Example 4:  Conditional classes with `false` values**\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst isError = false;\nconst myClass = classNames('input-field', { error: isError });\nconsole.log(myClass); // Output: \"input-field\"\n```\n\nA class is only added if the corresponding value is truthy (other than string \"false\").\n\n\nThese examples illustrate the basic usage of `classnames`.  For more advanced features and options, refer to the official documentation.\n\n\n### String-based Classnames\n\nThe simplest way to use `classnames` is by passing strings directly.  These strings represent individual CSS class names.  They are concatenated with spaces to form the final class string.\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst myClass = classNames('container', 'row', 'justify-content-center');\nconsole.log(myClass); // Output: \"container row justify-content-center\"\n```\n\nMultiple string arguments are added sequentially, separated by spaces.\n\n\n### Array-based Classnames\n\nYou can pass arrays of strings as arguments.  Each element in the array will be treated as an individual class name. Arrays are flattened during processing.\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst myClass = classNames('container', ['row', 'justify-content-center'], 'text-center');\nconsole.log(myClass); // Output: \"container row justify-content-center text-center\"\n\nconst myOtherClass = classNames(['btn','btn-primary'], ['large', 'text-bold']);\nconsole.log(myOtherClass); //Output: \"btn btn-primary large text-bold\"\n\n```\n\n\n### Object-based Classnames\n\nObject-based arguments allow for conditional class application.  The keys represent the class names, and the values represent boolean conditions.  A class is only added if its corresponding value is truthy (evaluates to `true` in a boolean context).  Note that values are evaluated strictly, and a string like \"false\" will be treated as a truthy value.  Use a boolean `false` for conditionally omitting a class.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst isActive = true;\nconst isError = false;\nconst myClass = classNames('button', { active: isActive, error: isError, 'text-large': true });\nconsole.log(myClass); // Output: \"button active text-large\"\n\nconst isDisabled = \"false\"; // This is still truthy\nconst anotherClass = classNames('btn', {disabled: isDisabled});\nconsole.log(anotherClass); //Output: \"btn disabled\"\n\nconst anotherClass2 = classNames('btn', {disabled: false});\nconsole.log(anotherClass2); //Output: \"btn\"\n```\n\nNote that keys with truthy values are included.  The example illustrates the use of quoted keys to use classes with spaces or hyphens (e.g., `'text-large'`).\n\n### Conditional Classnames\n\nConditional class names are typically implemented using object-based arguments as demonstrated above. The boolean values in the object determine whether a class is added or not.  This makes conditional styling concise and readable.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst isLoading = true;\nconst myClass = classNames('button', { loading: isLoading, 'button-disabled': !isLoading });\nconsole.log(myClass);  // Output: \"button loading\"\n\nconst anotherLoading = false;\nconst myOtherClass = classNames('button', {loading: anotherLoading, 'button-disabled': !anotherLoading});\nconsole.log(myOtherClass); //Output: \"button button-disabled\"\n\n```\n\nThis example shows how to use the `!` operator for negating boolean conditions.\n\n\n### Combining Different Approaches\n\nYou can combine string, array, and object arguments in a single `classnames` call.  The library processes them sequentially and intelligently merges them to form the final class string.\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst isActive = true;\nconst size = 'large';\nconst myClass = classNames('button', ['btn-primary'], { active: isActive }, size, ['margin-bottom-10']);\nconsole.log(myClass); // Output: \"button btn-primary active large margin-bottom-10\"\n```\n\nThis demonstrates the flexibility of the library in handling various input types for maximum expressiveness and conciseness in managing your CSS classes.  The order of arguments matters; string arguments will always come before conditional object-based arguments.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\nThis section explores more advanced usage patterns and optimization strategies for the `classnames` library.\n\n### Using Classnames with Frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)\n\n`classnames` is framework-agnostic and works seamlessly with various JavaScript frameworks.  Its primary benefit lies in its ability to create dynamic class names, which is particularly useful in component-based frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.\n\n**React Example:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const myClass = classNames('my-component', { active: props.isActive, error: props.hasError });\n  return <div className={myClass}>My Component</div>;\n}\n```\n\nThis React component uses `classnames` to dynamically apply classes based on props.  This approach keeps the rendering logic clean and avoids complicated ternary expressions or nested `if` statements within the JSX.  Similar approaches work in Vue and other frameworks by using the generated class string within the appropriate template mechanisms.\n\n\n### Dynamic Classnames\n\n`classnames` excels at generating dynamic class names based on runtime conditions.  This can involve variables, function calls, or the results of computations.\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst color = 'blue';\nconst size = 'large';\nconst isVisible = true;\n\nconst dynamicClass = classNames(\n  'item',\n  `color-${color}`, // Template literal for dynamic class names\n  isVisible ? size : 'small' // Conditional class based on isVisible\n);\n\nconsole.log(dynamicClass); // Output: 'item color-blue large' (if isVisible is true)\n```\n\nThis example leverages template literals for creating dynamic class names, directly integrating them into the `classnames` function.\n\n\n### Handling Nested Objects\n\nWhile `classnames` primarily handles flat objects for conditional classes, you can achieve nested conditional logic by creating helper functions or combining multiple `classnames` calls.\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nconst buttonState = {\n  type: 'primary',\n  size: 'large',\n  loading: false,\n};\n\nconst buttonClasses = classNames(\n  'btn',\n  buttonState.type,\n  buttonState.size,\n  { 'btn-loading': buttonState.loading }\n);\n\nconsole.log(buttonClasses); // Output: 'btn primary large'\n```\n\n\n### Custom Functions for Class Generation\n\nFor more complex class generation logic, you can create custom functions to generate class names dynamically and then pass those functions to `classnames`.  This promotes better code organization and reusability.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\n\nfunction generateButtonClasses(type, size) {\n  return classNames('btn', type, size);\n}\n\nconst buttonClass = generateButtonClasses('success', 'small');\nconsole.log(buttonClass); // Output: 'btn success small'\n\n```\n\nThis example shows how to encapsulate class generation into a reusable function, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\n\n### Optimizing Performance with Classnames\n\n`classnames` is already highly optimized for performance.  However, for extremely large-scale applications or situations involving an enormous number of conditional classes, consider these optimization strategies:\n\n* **Memoization:**  If the input to `classnames` remains unchanged between renders (common in React components), memoization can avoid redundant calculations.\n* **Pre-calculated Classes:**  For static or infrequently changing classes, calculate them once and store them as constants.  This reduces runtime overhead.\n* **Avoid Excessive Conditional Logic:**  Complex nested conditional statements can be less efficient. Optimize your conditional logic to minimize computational cost.\n\n\n\nBy applying these techniques, you can harness the full power and efficiency of `classnames` in even the most demanding applications. Remember to profile your application to identify any actual performance bottlenecks before applying extensive optimizations.\n\n\n## Best Practices\n\nThis section outlines best practices for using the `classnames` library to ensure clean, maintainable, and accessible code.\n\n### Organization and Readability\n\n* **Consistent Naming:**  Use a consistent naming convention for your CSS classes (e.g., BEM, SMACSS).  This improves readability and maintainability across your project.\n\n* **Logical Grouping:**  Group related classes together within your `classnames` calls to improve code readability.  Avoid excessively long chains of arguments.\n\n* **Helper Functions:**  For complex class generation logic, encapsulate it within helper functions to improve code organization and reduce redundancy.  This promotes reusability and makes your code easier to understand.\n\n* **Comments:**  Add comments where necessary to explain complex conditional logic within `classnames` calls.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nAlthough `classnames` itself doesn't handle runtime errors directly, errors usually stem from issues in your application logic that produces incorrect inputs to the `classnames` function.\n\n* **Input Validation:** If you're building a reusable component that uses `classnames`, consider validating inputs to ensure they're in the expected format (strings, arrays, or objects).  This will help prevent unexpected behavior.\n\n* **Logging:**  In development, consider using `console.log` to inspect the output of `classnames` to debug any unexpected behavior.  This helps in identifying where the problem lies – whether in the class name generation or the conditional logic that drives it.\n\n\n### Maintaining Consistency\n\n* **Version Control:** Track changes to your CSS classes and `classnames` usage using a version control system (like Git).  This helps in managing changes and rolling back if needed.\n\n* **Code Reviews:**  Incorporate code reviews as part of your development process.  This allows others to examine your `classnames` usage and provide feedback, improving consistency and identifying potential issues early.\n\n* **Style Guide:** Establish a style guide for your team that outlines best practices for using `classnames` and CSS class naming conventions.  This enforces consistency across your project.\n\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n`classnames` itself does not introduce any direct security vulnerabilities.  However, ensuring the security of your application depends on how you use it:\n\n* **Sanitize User Input:**  If the class names are influenced by user-provided data, always sanitize the input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  Never directly use user input as CSS class names without proper sanitization.\n\n* **Avoid Dynamically Generated Class Names from Untrusted Sources:**  If you absolutely must dynamically generate class names based on user inputs, use a robust sanitization function that ensures that only safe characters are included in the generated class names. This should be viewed as a last resort.\n\n\n### Accessibility Best Practices\n\n* **Semantic HTML:**  Prioritize using semantic HTML elements rather than relying solely on CSS classes for structural information.\n\n* **ARIA Attributes:**  When needed, use ARIA attributes to provide additional semantic information to assistive technologies.  Don't rely on CSS classes alone to convey meaning to screen readers.\n\n* **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.  Don't use CSS classes to override this crucial aspect of accessibility.  Instead, adhere to WCAG guidelines when defining styles directly.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can leverage `classnames` effectively, creating cleaner, safer, and more accessible applications. Remember that `classnames` is a utility; the ultimate responsibility for code quality, security, and accessibility lies with your overall application design and implementation.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\nThis section provides guidance on troubleshooting common problems and answering frequently asked questions related to the `classnames` library.\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Inspect the Output:** The simplest debugging step is to use `console.log(classNames(...yourArguments))` to see the exact string of class names generated.  This helps pinpoint discrepancies between expected and actual output.\n\n* **Check Input Types:** Verify that the arguments passed to `classnames` are of the correct type (strings, arrays, or objects).  Incorrect input types can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n* **Simplify the Logic:** If you have complex conditional logic, try simplifying it temporarily to isolate the source of the problem.  Break down large `classnames` calls into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n* **Use a Debugger:** Use your browser's developer tools or a JavaScript debugger to step through the code execution and inspect variables at runtime.  This allows you to trace the flow of execution and understand how the class names are being generated.\n\n* **Test with Simple Cases:** Create simple test cases to verify the behavior of `classnames` with different input combinations.  This helps isolate and fix issues more effectively.\n\n\n### Common Errors and Solutions\n\n* **Unexpected Class Names:** If you see class names that you didn't expect, check for typos in your class names or ensure your conditional logic is correctly evaluating to `true` or `false`.  Carefully review the boolean values in your object arguments.\n\n* **Missing Classes:**  If a class isn't being added when expected, double-check the truthiness of the corresponding value in the object argument passed to `classnames`. Remember that the value needs to be strictly truthy (not just a string that can be interpreted as true).\n\n* **Incorrect Spacing:**  `classnames` automatically handles spacing between class names.  You shouldn't manually add spaces within your arguments.\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n* **Q: Can I use `classnames` with a framework other than React?**\n    * A: Yes, `classnames` is framework-agnostic and works with any JavaScript project, including Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.  The core functionality remains consistent.\n\n* **Q: How do I handle nested conditional logic?**\n    * A: While `classnames` doesn't directly support nested objects, you can use helper functions or combine multiple `classnames` calls to manage complex conditional logic.  This keeps your code more readable.\n\n* **Q: What is the performance impact of `classnames`?**\n    * A: `classnames` is designed to be performant.  However, for very large-scale applications with extremely complex conditional class logic, consider optimization techniques like memoization or pre-calculating static class names.\n\n* **Q: How do I sanitize user input before using it with `classnames`?**\n    * A:  Never directly use unsanitized user input as CSS class names.  Always sanitize input using appropriate techniques to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  This is crucial for security.\n\n* **Q: Can I use `classnames` with CSS Modules or other CSS-in-JS solutions?**\n    * A: Yes, `classnames` works perfectly with CSS Modules and other CSS-in-JS solutions. You'll pass your class names (generated via your chosen CSS-in-JS method) as arguments.\n\n* **Q:  Why is my class not appearing even though the conditional logic seems correct?**\n    * A:  Double-check that the value associated with your class name in the object is actually truthy (true, a non-empty string, a non-zero number, etc.). A value of `0`, `false`, `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string (`\"\"`) will cause the class to be omitted.\n\n\nIf you encounter issues not covered here, consult the official `classnames` documentation or search for solutions on relevant online forums and communities.  Providing a code snippet illustrating your specific problem will usually help others assist you effectively.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a detailed reference to the `classnames` function and its behavior.\n\n### Classnames Function Details\n\nThe core of the `classnames` library is a single function: `classnames()`.  This function accepts a variable number of arguments and returns a single string representing the concatenated class names.  The key to its functionality is the intelligent handling of different data types passed as arguments.\n\n**Signature:**\n\n```javascript\nclassnames(...args: (string | string[] | { [className: string]: boolean })) => string\n```\n\nThe function accepts an arbitrary number of arguments (`...args`). Each argument can be one of the following types:\n\n* **String:** A single CSS class name.\n* **Array of Strings:** An array of CSS class names.\n* **Object:** An object where keys are class names and values are booleans indicating whether to include the class.\n\n\n### Supported Data Types\n\nAs mentioned above, `classnames` supports three primary data types:\n\n* **String:**  Represents a single CSS class name.  Example: `\"container\"`.\n\n* **Array of Strings:**  Represents a list of CSS class names.  Example: `[\"row\", \"justify-center\"]`.  The array is flattened; nested arrays are handled correctly.\n\n* **Object:**  Represents conditional classes. Keys are class names (strings), and values are booleans.  A class is included in the output only if its corresponding value is truthy (evaluates to `true` in a boolean context). Example: `{ active: true, disabled: false }`.  Keys can contain spaces or hyphens if they are wrapped in quotes (e.g., `{'my-class': true}`).\n\n\n### Return Values\n\nThe `classnames` function always returns a single string. This string is a space-separated list of the class names that were included based on the input arguments.  If no class names are included (e.g., all conditional classes are `false`), an empty string (`\"\"`) is returned.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Exceptions\n\nThe `classnames` library itself does not throw any exceptions.  It's designed to be robust and handle various input types gracefully.  However, unexpected behavior might arise from incorrect usage:\n\n* **Incorrect Input Types:** Passing arguments of unexpected types (e.g., numbers, objects with non-boolean values) will not result in errors but might lead to unexpected outputs.  The library will attempt to coerce values to a string representation in most cases, which may or may not be what was intended.\n\n* **Logic Errors:** Errors in your conditional logic (in object arguments) will not be caught by `classnames`.  Ensure your boolean conditions accurately reflect the desired class inclusion.\n\n* **Typos:** Typos in class names are not caught by `classnames`.  Always double-check your class names for accuracy.\n\n\nIt's best practice to carefully review the generated class names using `console.log` during development to ensure they match your expectations.  If you encounter unexpected behavior, try simplifying your `classnames` call to isolate the issue.  Remember that error handling in the context of `classnames` lies more in the logic of your application rather than within the library itself.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### What is Classnames?\n\n`classnames` is a small utility library that helps you compose CSS class names dynamically, especially useful when dealing with conditional styling in React (or any JavaScript project).

However, for extremely large-scale applications or situations involving an enormous number of conditional classes, consider these optimization strategies:\n\n* **Memoization:**  If the input to `classnames` remains unchanged between renders (common in React components), memoization can avoid redundant calculations.\n* **Pre-calculated Classes:**  For static or infrequently changing classes, calculate them once and store them as constants.  This reduces runtime overhead.\n* **Avoid Excessive Conditional Logic:**  Complex nested conditional statements can be less efficient. Optimize your conditional logic to minimize computational cost.\n\n\n\nBy applying these techniques, you can harness the full power and efficiency of `classnames` in even the most demanding applications. Remember to profile your application to identify any actual performance bottlenecks before applying extensive optimizations.\n\n\n## Best Practices\n\nThis section outlines best practices for using the `classnames` library to ensure clean, maintainable, and accessible code.\n\n### Organization and Readability\n\n* **Consistent Naming:**  Use a consistent naming convention for your CSS classes (e.g., BEM, SMACSS).  This improves readability and maintainability across your project.\n\n* **Logical Grouping:**  Group related classes together within your `classnames` calls to improve code readability.  Avoid excessively long chains of arguments.\n\n* **Helper Functions:**  For complex class generation logic, encapsulate it within helper functions to improve code organization and reduce redundancy.  This promotes reusability and makes your code easier to understand.\n\n* **Comments:**  Add comments where necessary to explain complex conditional logic within `classnames` calls.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nAlthough `classnames` itself doesn't handle runtime errors directly, errors usually stem from issues in your application logic that produces incorrect inputs to the `classnames` function.\n\n* **Input Validation:** If you're building a reusable component that uses `classnames`, consider validating inputs to ensure they're in the expected format (strings, arrays, or objects).  This will help prevent unexpected behavior.\n\n* **Logging:**  In development, consider using `console.log` to inspect the output of `classnames` to debug any unexpected behavior.  This helps in identifying where the problem lies – whether in the class name generation or the conditional logic that drives it.\n\n\n### Maintaining Consistency\n\n* **Version Control:** Track changes to your CSS classes and `classnames` usage using a version control system (like Git).  This helps in managing changes and rolling back if needed.\n\n* **Code Reviews:**  Incorporate code reviews as part of your development process.  This allows others to examine your `classnames` usage and provide feedback, improving consistency and identifying potential issues early.\n\n* **Style Guide:** Establish a style guide for your team that outlines best practices for using `classnames` and CSS class naming conventions.  This enforces consistency across your project.\n\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n`classnames` itself does not introduce any direct security vulnerabilities.  However, ensuring the security of your application depends on how you use it:\n\n* **Sanitize User Input:**  If the class names are influenced by user-provided data, always sanitize the input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  Never directly use user input as CSS class names without proper sanitization.\n\n* **Avoid Dynamically Generated Class Names from Untrusted Sources:**  If you absolutely must dynamically generate class names based on user inputs, use a robust sanitization function that ensures that only safe characters are included in the generated class names. This should be viewed as a last resort.\n\n\n### Accessibility Best Practices\n\n* **Semantic HTML:**  Prioritize using semantic HTML elements rather than relying solely on CSS classes for structural information.\n\n* **ARIA Attributes:**  When needed, use ARIA attributes to provide additional semantic information to assistive technologies.  Don't rely on CSS classes alone to convey meaning to screen readers.\n\n* **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.  Don't use CSS classes to override this crucial aspect of accessibility.  Instead, adhere to WCAG guidelines when defining styles directly.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can leverage `classnames` effectively, creating cleaner, safer, and more accessible applications. Remember that `classnames` is a utility; the ultimate responsibility for code quality, security, and accessibility lies with your overall application design and implementation.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\nThis section provides guidance on troubleshooting common problems and answering frequently asked questions related to the `classnames` library.\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Inspect the Output:** The simplest debugging step is to use `console.log(classNames(...yourArguments))` to see the exact string of class names generated.  This helps pinpoint discrepancies between expected and actual output.\n\n* **Check Input Types:** Verify that the arguments passed to `classnames` are of the correct type (strings, arrays, or objects).  Incorrect input types can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n* **Simplify the Logic:** If you have complex conditional logic, try simplifying it temporarily to isolate the source of the problem.  Break down large `classnames` calls into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n* **Use a Debugger:** Use your browser's developer tools or a JavaScript debugger to step through the code execution and inspect variables at runtime.  This allows you to trace the flow of execution and understand how the class names are being generated.\n\n* **Test with Simple Cases:** Create simple test cases to verify the behavior of `classnames` with different input combinations.  This helps isolate and fix issues more effectively.\n\n\n### Common Errors and Solutions\n\n* **Unexpected Class Names:** If you see class names that you didn't expect, check for typos in your class names or ensure your conditional logic is correctly evaluating to `true` or `false`.  Carefully review the boolean values in your object arguments.\n\n* **Missing Classes:**  If a class isn't being added when expected, double-check the truthiness of the corresponding value in the object argument passed to `classnames`. Remember that the value needs to be strictly truthy (not just a string that can be interpreted as true).\n\n* **Incorrect Spacing:**  `classnames` automatically handles spacing between class names.  You shouldn't manually add spaces within your arguments.\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n* **Q: Can I use `classnames` with a framework other than React?**\n    * A: Yes, `classnames` is framework-agnostic and works with any JavaScript project, including Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.  The core functionality remains consistent.\n\n* **Q: How do I handle nested conditional logic?**\n    * A: While `classnames` doesn't directly support nested objects, you can use helper functions or combine multiple `classnames` calls to manage complex conditional logic.  This keeps your code more readable.\n\n* **Q: What is the performance impact of `classnames`?**\n    * A: `classnames` is designed to be performant.  However, for very large-scale applications with extremely complex conditional class logic, consider optimization techniques like memoization or pre-calculating static class names.\n\n* **Q: How do I sanitize user input before using it with `classnames`?**\n    * A:  Never directly use unsanitized user input as CSS class names.  Always sanitize input using appropriate techniques to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  This is crucial for security.\n\n* **Q: Can I use `classnames` with CSS Modules or other CSS-in-JS solutions?**\n    * A: Yes, `classnames` works perfectly with CSS Modules and other CSS-in-JS solutions. You'll pass your class names (generated via your chosen CSS-in-JS method) as arguments.\n\n* **Q:  Why is my class not appearing even though the conditional logic seems correct?**\n    * A:  Double-check that the value associated with your class name in the object is actually truthy (true, a non-empty string, a non-zero number, etc.). A value of `0`, `false`, `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string (`\"\"`) will cause the class to be omitted.\n\n\nIf you encounter issues not covered here, consult the official `classnames` documentation or search for solutions on relevant online forums and communities.  Providing a code snippet illustrating your specific problem will usually help others assist you effectively.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a detailed reference to the `classnames` function and its behavior.\n\n### Classnames Function Details\n\nThe core of the `classnames` library is a single function: `classnames()`.  This function accepts a variable number of arguments and returns a single string representing the concatenated class names.  The key to its functionality is the intelligent handling of different data types passed as arguments.\n\n**Signature:**\n\n```javascript\nclassnames(...args: (string | string[] | { [className: string]: boolean })) => string\n```\n\nThe function accepts an arbitrary number of arguments (`...args`). Each argument can be one of the following types:\n\n* **String:** A single CSS class name.\n* **Array of Strings:** An array of CSS class names.\n* **Object:** An object where keys are class names and values are booleans indicating whether to include the class.\n\n\n### Supported Data Types\n\nAs mentioned above, `classnames` supports three primary data types:\n\n* **String:**  Represents a single CSS class name.  Example: `\"container\"`.\n\n* **Array of Strings:**  Represents a list of CSS class names.  Example: `[\"row\", \"justify-center\"]`.  The array is flattened; nested arrays are handled correctly.\n\n* **Object:**  Represents conditional classes. Keys are class names (strings), and values are booleans.  A class is included in the output only if its corresponding value is truthy (evaluates to `true` in a boolean context). Example: `{ active: true, disabled: false }`.  Keys can contain spaces or hyphens if they are wrapped in quotes (e.g., `{'my-class': true}`).\n\n\n### Return Values\n\nThe `classnames` function always returns a single string. This string is a space-separated list of the class names that were included based on the input arguments.  If no class names are included (e.g., all conditional classes are `false`), an empty string (`\"\"`) is returned.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Exceptions\n\nThe `classnames` library itself does not throw any exceptions.  It's designed to be robust and handle various input types gracefully.  However, unexpected behavior might arise from incorrect usage:\n\n* **Incorrect Input Types:** Passing arguments of unexpected types (e.g., numbers, objects with non-boolean values) will not result in errors but might lead to unexpected outputs.  The library will attempt to coerce values to a string representation in most cases, which may or may not be what was intended.\n\n* **Logic Errors:** Errors in your conditional logic (in object arguments) will not be caught by `classnames`.  Ensure your boolean conditions accurately reflect the desired class inclusion.\n\n* **Typos:** Typos in class names are not caught by `classnames`.  Always double-check your class names for accuracy.\n\n\nIt's best practice to carefully review the generated class names using `console.log` during development to ensure they match your expectations.  If you encounter unexpected behavior, try simplifying your `classnames` call to isolate the issue.  Remember that error handling in the context of `classnames` lies more in the logic of your application rather than within the library itself.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
