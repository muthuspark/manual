It achieves this without relying on server-side technologies or geolocation APIs, making it a simple and efficient client-side solution. The library determines the timezone by analyzing the user's browser's settings and the offset from UTC.  It returns the IANA timezone name (e.g., \"America/New_York\", \"Europe/London\").\n\n\n### Why use jsTimezoneDetect?\n\n* **Client-side detection:** jsTimezoneDetect operates entirely within the user's browser, eliminating the need for server-side calls or additional API dependencies.  This improves performance and reduces server load.\n\n* **Lightweight and efficient:**  The library is small and fast, minimizing the impact on your application's loading time and resource consumption.\n\n* **Accurate timezone detection:** While not foolproof (user settings can be manipulated), jsTimezoneDetect provides a reliable method for determining the user's timezone based on readily available browser information.\n\n* **Simple API:** The library features a straightforward and easy-to-use API, making integration into existing projects seamless.\n\n* **IANA Timezone Names:**  It returns IANA timezone names, the standard for representing timezones, ensuring compatibility with various date/time libraries and applications.\n\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\njsTimezoneDetect is available via npm and a CDN.\n\n**Using npm:**\n\n1.  Install the package:  `npm install jstimezonedetect`\n2.  Import it into your JavaScript code:\n\n```javascript\nimport jsTimezoneDetect from 'jstimezonedetect';\n\nconst timezone = jsTimezoneDetect.determine();\nconsole.log(timezone); // Output: e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"\n```\n\n**Using a CDN (e.g., jsDelivr):**\n\nInclude the library in your HTML `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jstimezonedetect@1.0.0/dist/jstimezonedetect.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThen, you can use it in your JavaScript code:\n\n```javascript\nconst timezone = jsTimezoneDetect.determine();\nconsole.log(timezone); // Output: e.g., \"Europe/Paris\"\n```\n\nAfter including the library, the `jsTimezoneDetect.determine()` function will return a string representing the detected IANA timezone name. If no timezone can be determined, it returns `null`.  Remember to handle the possibility of a `null` return value in your application logic.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Detecting the User's Timezone\n\nThe core functionality of jsTimezoneDetect revolves around the `determine()` method. This method analyzes the user's browser's time zone offset from UTC and other available browser information to infer the user's timezone.  It does *not* use geolocation data. The process is entirely client-side.\n\nThe `determine()` method returns a string representing the IANA timezone name (e.g., \"America/New_York\", \"Europe/London\").  If the library is unable to determine the timezone, it returns `null`.\n\n```javascript\nimport jsTimezoneDetect from 'jstimezonedetect';\n\nconst timezone = jsTimezoneDetect.determine();\n\nif (timezone) {\n  console.log(\"Detected timezone:\", timezone);\n  // Use the timezone value\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Could not determine timezone.\");\n  // Handle the case where timezone detection failed\n}\n```\n\n\n### Timezone Representation\n\njsTimezoneDetect consistently uses IANA timezone names (also known as Olson names) to represent timezones.  IANA names are the standard and are preferred over other representations because of their consistency and widespread support across various programming languages and libraries.  Using IANA names ensures interoperability and avoids ambiguity.  Examples of IANA timezone names include:\n\n* `America/New_York`\n* `Europe/London`\n* `Asia/Tokyo`\n* `Australia/Sydney`\n\n\n### Accuracy and Limitations\n\nWhile jsTimezoneDetect strives for accuracy, it's crucial to understand its limitations:\n\n* **User-Modifiable Settings:** The browser's timezone setting can be manually altered by the user.  This means the detected timezone might not accurately reflect the user's actual physical location.\n\n* **Browser Variations:**  Different browsers might handle timezone information slightly differently, potentially leading to minor inconsistencies in detection.\n\n* **No Geolocation:**  The library *does not* use geolocation data.  Therefore, it cannot determine the timezone based on the user's geographic coordinates.  It solely relies on the browser's internal timezone settings.\n\n* **Ambiguous Timezones:** In some cases, the offset from UTC might be shared by multiple timezones, leading to potential inaccuracies.  The library employs heuristics to minimize this but doesn't eliminate the possibility entirely.\n\n\n### Handling Errors\n\nThe primary error scenario is the inability to detect a timezone.  This is signaled by the `determine()` method returning `null`.  Robust applications should always check for this condition and implement appropriate fallback mechanisms.  For example, you might display a message asking the user to adjust their browser's timezone settings or use a default timezone.  The library itself does not throw exceptions.  Error handling is entirely the responsibility of the application using it.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nconst timezone = jsTimezoneDetect.determine();\nif (timezone === null) {\n  // Handle the error:  Display a message, use a default timezone, etc.\n  const defaultTimezone = 'UTC'; // Or another suitable default\n  console.log(\"Using default timezone:\", defaultTimezone);\n}\n```\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Detection Methods\n\njsTimezoneDetect's core functionality is encapsulated within the `determine()` method. While this method employs robust heuristics for timezone detection,  it does not offer direct customization of the underlying detection logic. The library's internal workings are optimized for accuracy and efficiency, and direct manipulation of these processes is not provided through a public API.  If you require highly specific or non-standard timezone detection behavior, you would need to implement a custom solution outside the scope of this library.  jsTimezoneDetect is designed to provide a simple, reliable, and widely compatible solution; deep customization is not a design goal.\n\n\n### Integrating with other libraries\n\njsTimezoneDetect seamlessly integrates with other JavaScript libraries that work with dates and times. Because it returns IANA timezone names, it's easily compatible with libraries like Moment Timezone, Luxon, date-fns-tz, and others that support IANA names.\n\nFor example, with Moment Timezone:\n\n```javascript\nimport jsTimezoneDetect from 'jstimezonedetect';\nimport moment from 'moment-timezone';\n\nconst timezone = jsTimezoneDetect.determine();\n\nif (timezone) {\n  const now = moment().tz(timezone);\n  console.log(now.format());\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Could not determine timezone.\");\n}\n```\n\nRemember to install the necessary dependencies (`moment` and `moment-timezone`).  Adapt the code snippet to match the specific API of your chosen date/time library.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\njsTimezoneDetect is already highly optimized for performance.  Its small size and efficient algorithm minimize the impact on your application's loading time and execution speed.  Further optimization efforts would typically be focused on the broader application context rather than the library itself.\n\nHere are some general performance considerations when using jsTimezoneDetect:\n\n* **Caching:** If you need to repeatedly determine the timezone, consider caching the result to avoid redundant calculations.  Store the detected timezone in a variable or browser storage (like `localStorage`) and retrieve it when needed.\n\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** If timezone detection is not critical for initial page load, consider performing it asynchronously using `setTimeout` or `Promise` to prevent blocking the main thread.\n\n* **Minimize Redundant Calls:** Only call `jsTimezoneDetect.determine()` when necessary. Avoid unnecessary calls within loops or frequently triggered events.\n\nRemember that the performance impact of `jsTimezoneDetect.determine()` is generally minimal, and premature optimization should be avoided. Focus your performance tuning efforts on other parts of your application if performance bottlenecks are identified.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\njsTimezoneDetect provides a straightforward API with a few key methods for timezone detection.  Note that the library does not directly offer methods to *set* the timezone; it only detects the user's existing browser-reported timezone.\n\n### `determine()`\n\nThis is the primary method for determining the user's timezone.  It returns a string representing the IANA timezone name (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\") or `null` if the timezone cannot be determined.\n\n```javascript\nimport jsTimezoneDetect from 'jstimezonedetect';\n\nconst timezone = jsTimezoneDetect.determine(); \nconsole.log(timezone); // Output: e.g., \"America/New_York\" or null\n```\n\n### `getAllTimezones()`\n\nThis method is **not** part of the core `jsTimezoneDetect` library.  The library does not have a built-in list of all time zones.  If you need such a list, you'll need to obtain it from another source, such as a separate timezone database or API.  The `jsTimezoneDetect` library focuses solely on detecting the *user's* timezone, not providing a comprehensive timezone list.\n\n### `setDefaultOptions()`\n\nThis method is **not** part of the core `jsTimezoneDetect` library. The library currently does not support configurable options.  Future versions *might* include options, but as of now, no options are available for setting or changing default behavior.\n\n\n### `getOptions()`\n\nThis method is **not** part of the core `jsTimezoneDetect` library.  Similar to `setDefaultOptions()`,  there are currently no configurable options, so this method would be unnecessary.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nMost issues encountered when using jsTimezoneDetect stem from incorrect usage or misunderstandings of its capabilities and limitations.\n\n* **`null` returned from `determine()`:** This is the most common scenario. It indicates that the library couldn't reliably determine the user's timezone. This isn't necessarily an error in the library itself; it means the browser didn't provide sufficient information.  Possible causes include:\n    * **Incorrectly configured browser settings:** The user might have manually set an incorrect timezone in their browser settings.\n    * **Browser limitations:** Some older or less common browsers might not provide consistent timezone information.\n    * **Privacy settings:**  In rare cases, strict privacy settings might prevent the library from accessing the necessary browser data.\n\n    **Solution:** Implement proper error handling in your code to gracefully handle `null` returns (see the \"Handling Errors\" section in the Core Functionality chapter).  Consider providing a fallback mechanism, such as using a default timezone or prompting the user to check their browser settings.\n\n* **Timezone is inaccurate:** The detected timezone might not always perfectly reflect the user's actual geographic location.  This is because the library relies on the browser's internal timezone setting, which is user-configurable and might not be accurate.\n    * **Solution:**  jsTimezoneDetect is intended to detect the *reported* timezone, not the *actual* geographic location. If geographic precision is paramount, consider using a geolocation API in conjunction with a timezone database.\n\n\n* **Library not loading:**  Ensure the library is correctly included in your project. Check the paths in your HTML or the import statements in your JavaScript code.\n\n    * **Solution:** Double-check the inclusion method (npm or CDN) and verify that the path to the library file is correct. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the network requests to ensure the library is successfully downloaded and parsed.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer console to inspect any errors during library loading or execution. Check the console for any `console.log` outputs to track the execution flow.\n\n* **Check the `determine()` return value:** Always explicitly check if `jsTimezoneDetect.determine()` returns `null`.  Don't assume it will always provide a valid timezone.\n\n* **Simplify your code:** If you encounter issues, isolate the jsTimezoneDetect part of your code to ensure the problem isn't related to other parts of your application.  Create a minimal, reproducible test case to pinpoint the problem.\n\n* **Check browser settings:**  If you suspect a problem with the user's timezone settings, you might want to add instructions guiding them on how to verify and correct their browser's timezone configuration.  However, you can't directly *correct* it through the library.\n\n\n* **Consult the source code:** If you have a very specific problem or suspect a bug in the library, you can examine the library's source code for clues. The codebase is fairly small and easy to understand.  But before assuming it's a bug, thoroughly test your usage with the library.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to jsTimezoneDetect!  Whether it's reporting bugs, suggesting new features, or improving the codebase, your involvement is valuable.\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\nIf you encounter a bug, please follow these steps:\n\n1. **Search existing issues:** Check if a similar issue has already been reported.
