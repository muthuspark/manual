It allows you to easily add client-side sorting capabilities to your tables, enabling users to interactively sort table rows based on the data within individual columns.  This enhances the usability of your tables, making it easier for users to find and analyze data.  Unlike server-side sorting, Tablesorter performs sorting directly in the user's browser, resulting in faster response times and reduced server load.\n\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Multiple Column Sorting:** Users can sort by multiple columns simultaneously, specifying ascending or descending order for each column.\n* **Customizable Sorting Types:**  Supports various data types including numbers, dates, strings (case-insensitive and case-sensitive), IP addresses, and more.  You can also define your own custom sorting functions for specialized data.\n* **Parser Support:**  Built-in parsers handle various data formats and automatically detect the appropriate sorting type.  Custom parsers can be created for complex data structures.\n* **Widgets:**  Extensible with widgets that add functionalities like filter rows, pagination, and styling enhancements.\n* **Header styling:** Easily customizable header styling to indicate sort order (ascending/descending).\n* **Lightweight and Efficient:**  Tablesorter is designed for performance and minimal impact on page load times.\n* **Extensive Documentation and Community Support:**  A well-documented plugin with a supportive community to assist with troubleshooting and development.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nTablesorter is designed to work across a wide range of modern web browsers.  While it aims for broad compatibility, optimal performance and feature support are best achieved with modern, up-to-date browsers.  For optimal results, we recommend using the latest versions of:\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Safari\n* Microsoft Edge\n\nOlder browsers might exhibit limited support or require additional configuration. Thorough testing across your target browsers is always recommended.\n\n\n### Getting Started: Installation and Setup\n\n1. **Include jQuery:** Tablesorter relies on jQuery. Ensure you have included the jQuery library in your HTML file before including the Tablesorter plugin.  You can download jQuery from [https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/) or use a CDN link:\n\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n   ```\n\n2. **Include Tablesorter:** Download the Tablesorter plugin files (typically `jquery.tablesorter.js` and `jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js`) and include them in your HTML after the jQuery inclusion:\n\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"jquery.tablesorter.js\"></script>\n   <script src=\"jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js\"></script>\n   ```  Alternatively, use a CDN link if available.\n\n3. **Initialize Tablesorter:**  Select your table element using a jQuery selector and call the `tablesorter()` method.\n\n   ```html\n   <table id=\"myTable\">\n       <thead>\n           <tr>\n               <th>Column 1</th>\n               <th>Column 2</th>\n           </tr>\n       </thead>\n       <tbody>\n           <tr><td>Data 1</td><td>Data 2</td></tr>\n           <tr><td>Data 3</td><td>Data 4</td></tr>\n       </tbody>\n   </table>\n\n   <script>\n       $(document).ready(function() {\n           $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter();\n       });\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n   This basic setup will enable sorting on all columns.  For more advanced configurations (e.g., specifying sorting types, using widgets), refer to the detailed documentation and examples provided with the plugin.\n\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n### Initializing Tablesorter\n\nThe simplest way to initialize Tablesorter is by including the necessary JavaScript files (as described in the \"Getting Started\" section) and then calling the `tablesorter()` method on your table element using a jQuery selector.  This will automatically enable sorting on all columns based on their data type.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter(); \n});\n```\n\nReplace `\"#myTable\"` with the appropriate jQuery selector for your table.  This code should be placed within a `$(document).ready()` function to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before initializing the plugin.\n\n\n### Sorting Options\n\nTablesorter provides several options to customize its behavior. These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `tablesorter()` method.  Some key options include:\n\n* `theme`:  Specifies the CSS theme to use (e.g., \"blue\", \"bootstrap\").\n* `headers`:  An array specifying which columns are sortable (true/false) and their sorting type.\n* `sortList`:  An array defining the initial sorting order (e.g., [[0,0], [1,1]] sorts the first column ascending and the second column ascending).\n* `widgets`: An array of widgets to enable (e.g., ['filter', 'zebra']).\n\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        theme: \"blue\",\n        headers: { \n            0: { sorter: false }, // Disable sorting for the first column\n            1: { sorter: 'currency' } //Use currency sorter for the second column\n        },\n        sortList: [[1,1]] //Sort second column ascending initially\n    });\n});\n```\n\n\n### Default Sorting\n\nBy default, Tablesorter attempts to intelligently determine the data type of each column and applies the appropriate sorting algorithm.  It uses a series of built-in parsers to handle common data types like numbers, dates, and strings.  For numeric and date columns, sorting is typically handled correctly without any additional configuration.  String columns are sorted lexicographically (case-insensitive by default).\n\n\n### Customizing Sorting\n\nYou can customize the sorting behavior for specific columns using the `headers` option.  This allows you to specify a custom sorting function or use a predefined sorter.\n\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        headers: {\n            2: { sorter: 'text' } //Case-sensitive text sorting for column 3\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\nTo define a completely custom sorting function, you provide a function that takes two arguments (the values to compare) and returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the sort order.\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        headers: {\n            3: { sorter: function(a, b) {\n                    // Custom sorting logic here\n                    return a.localeCompare(b);\n                  }\n            }\n        }\n    });\n});\n\n```\n\n\n### Header Customization\n\nYou can control which columns are sortable and modify their header appearance using the `headers` option. Setting a header's `sorter` property to `false` disables sorting for that column.  You can also use CSS to style the headers.  Tablesorter adds classes to the header cells to indicate the sort order (e.g., `headerSortUp`, `headerSortDown`, `headerSort`).\n\n\n### Handling Data Types\n\nTablesorter includes built-in parsers to automatically handle various data types.  These parsers ensure correct sorting for numbers, dates, currencies, and more.  However, for complex or unusual data types, you may need to create custom parsers. The plugin documentation provides details on creating and registering custom parsers.  Common data types are typically handled correctly without explicit parser configuration.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Multiple Tables\n\nTablesorter can be used on multiple tables on a single page.  Simply call the `tablesorter()` method on each table element using its appropriate jQuery selector.  Ensure that each table has a unique ID or class for proper selection.\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#table1\").tablesorter();\n    $(\"#table2\").tablesorter();\n});\n```\n\n\n### Nested Tables\n\nTablesorter directly supports sorting only on the outermost tables.  Nested tables (tables within table cells) will not be sorted by the plugin. To handle nested tables, you would need to implement a custom solution, potentially involving iterating through the nested tables and applying sorting logic individually.\n\n\n### Sorting by Multiple Columns\n\nUsers can sort by multiple columns simultaneously by clicking on the column headers.  The order in which columns are clicked determines the sort order. To specify an initial multi-column sort order, use the `sortList` option:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        sortList: [[0, 1], [1, 0]] //Sort column 1 ascending, then column 2 descending\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis initializes the table sorted by column 1 ascending and then column 2 descending.\n\n\n### Filtering\n\nThe `filter` widget allows users to filter table rows based on the text content of each cell.  Enable the widget by including it in the `widgets` option:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        widgets: [\"filter\"]\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis adds a filter input field above each column header, allowing users to filter rows based on the column contents.  Consult the Tablesorter documentation for details on widget options and customization.\n\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe `pager` widget provides pagination functionality for large tables.  Enable the widget similarly to the filter:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        widgets: [\"pager\"]\n    });\n});\n```\n\nYou will also need to include appropriate HTML elements (e.g., for page navigation) as described in the plugin's documentation.\n\n\n### Widgets\n\nTablesorter's functionality is greatly extended by widgets.  Widgets add features like filtering, pagination, and styling enhancements.  Enable widgets by including their names in the `widgets` option array.  See the plugin's documentation for a complete list of available widgets and their configurations.\n\n\n### Custom Parser Functions\n\nFor data types not automatically handled by the built-in parsers, you can create custom parser functions. These functions define how data in a column should be interpreted for sorting. Refer to the Tablesorter documentation for details on creating and registering custom parsers. This involves defining a function that takes a cell's content as input and returns a value suitable for comparison.\n\n\n### Using Themes\n\nTablesorter supports various CSS themes to customize the table's appearance.  Select a theme using the `theme` option:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        theme: \"bootstrap\" // or \"blue\", \"jui\", etc.\n    });\n});\n```\n\nYou'll need the corresponding theme CSS file included in your project.\n\n\n### Accessibility\n\nEnsure your tables are accessible by following accessibility best practices. Use appropriate ARIA attributes (like `aria-sort` on headers) to improve screen reader compatibility.  Tablesorter generally supports accessibility features, but proper implementation of ARIA attributes and semantic HTML is crucial.\n\n\n### Internationalization\n\nFor internationalization support (handling different languages and locales), you might need to use a suitable date/time library and potentially create custom parsers to handle locale-specific date and number formats.  Consider using the `localeCompare` method for string comparisons to handle language-specific sorting.  The plugin itself doesn't include built-in internationalization features beyond the default capabilities of JavaScript's built-in functions.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Methods\n\nTablesorter exposes several methods for interacting with the plugin after initialization.  These methods are called on the jQuery object representing the table.  Some key methods include:\n\n* **`destroy()`:** Removes Tablesorter functionality from the table and restores the table to its original state.\n* **`addRows(rows, [update])`:** Adds new rows to the table.  The `rows` argument is an array of rows (each row can be a string of HTML or a jQuery object).  The optional `update` argument (boolean) indicates whether to update the table's sorting after adding rows.\n* **`update()`:** Re-initializes the sorting for the table.  Useful after adding, removing, or modifying rows.\n* **`sortOn(column, order)`:** Programmatically sorts the table by a specified column and order. `column` is the column index (0-based), and `order` is 0 for ascending and 1 for descending.\n* **`getSortList()`:** Returns the current sort order as an array.\n* **`setHeaderFilter(value, column)`:** Sets the filter value for a specified column. Useful for programmatic filtering.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n$(\"#myTable\").tablesorter().tablesorter(\"addRows\", [ \"<tr><td>New Row 1</td><td>Data</td></tr>\" ]);\n$(\"#myTable\").tablesorter(\"sortOn\", 0, 0); //Sort the first column ascending\nlet sortOrder = $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter(\"getSortList\");\nconsole.log(sortOrder); // Output current sort order\n```\n\nConsult the full Tablesorter documentation for a complete list of available methods and their parameters.\n\n\n### Events\n\nTablesorter triggers several events throughout its lifecycle.  These events can be used to perform custom actions based on sorting or other plugin operations.  These are jQuery events, so you can use jQuery's `on()` method to listen for them.  Some important events include:\n\n* **`sortBegin`:** Triggered before the sorting process begins.\n* **`sortEnd`:** Triggered after the sorting process is complete.\n* **`pagerComplete`:** Triggered after the pager widget completes pagination (if the pager widget is enabled).\n* **`filterStart`:** Triggered when filtering starts (filter widget).\n* **`filterEnd`:** Triggered when filtering completes (filter widget).\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n$(\"#myTable\").on(\"sortEnd\", function(e, table) {\n    console.log(\"Sorting complete!\");\n});\n```\n\n\n### Options\n\nThe options passed to the `tablesorter()` method control various aspects of the plugin's behavior. These options were discussed partially in the Basic Usage and Advanced Usage sections.  Refer to the full Tablesorter documentation for the complete list of options and their descriptions.  Options are key-value pairs within a JavaScript object.  Some of the commonly used options were already illustrated previously (e.g., `theme`, `headers`, `widgets`, `sortList`).\n\n\n### Public Properties\n\nTablesorter doesn't expose many public properties directly accessible from outside the plugin.  Information like the current sort order is usually accessed using methods like `getSortList()`.  The plugin's internal data structure is not intended for direct manipulation. The primary way to interact with the plugin is through its methods and events.  Avoid directly accessing or modifying internal plugin properties, as this might break functionality and is not supported.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nThis section addresses frequently encountered problems when using Tablesorter.\n\n* **Table not sorting:**\n    * **Problem:**  The table doesn't respond to header clicks, and no sorting occurs.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that jQuery is included *before* the Tablesorter scripts.\n        * Check your jQuery selector; ensure it correctly targets your table element.\n        * Ensure the `tablesorter()` method is called correctly within a `$(document).ready()` function.\n        * Inspect your browser's console for JavaScript errors.\n        * Check for conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.\n\n* **Incorrect sorting order:**\n    * **Problem:**  Data isn't sorted as expected (e.g., numbers treated as strings).\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Examine your data types; ensure numbers are represented numerically and dates are in a consistent format.\n        * Use the `headers` option to specify custom sorters for specific columns (see the \"Customizing Sorting\" section).\n        * Create custom parser functions to handle unusual data formats.\n\n* **Widgets not working:**\n    * **Problem:**  Features like filtering or pagination are not functional even after enabling the corresponding widgets.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that the necessary widget scripts (`jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js`) are included.\n        * Check for typos in the `widgets` option array.\n        * Ensure that the HTML structure required by the widgets is correctly implemented (refer to the widget documentation for specific requirements).\n\n* **Conflicting CSS:**\n    * **Problem:** The table's styling is overridden by other CSS rules, affecting the appearance of sorted columns or widget elements.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Use browser developer tools to inspect the CSS applied to the table and identify conflicting styles.\n        * Use more specific CSS selectors to override conflicting styles.\n        * Ensure that Tablesorter's CSS is loaded correctly and after any other conflicting stylesheets.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:**  Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Check the console for errors and warnings.  Use the network tab to ensure that all necessary files are loaded correctly.\n\n* **Console Logging:**  Add `console.log()` statements to your JavaScript code to track variable values and the execution flow.  This helps pinpoint errors in your initialization code or custom functions.\n\n* **Simplified Test Cases:**  If you are encountering issues with complex tables, try creating a simplified test case with minimal data and features. This isolates the problem and makes it easier to debug.\n\n* **jQuery Debugging:**  If you suspect jQuery-related issues, use jQuery's debugging tools or add `console.log` statements to trace jQuery's behavior in your code.\n\n* **Check the Tablesorter Documentation:**  Thoroughly read the official Tablesorter documentation for detailed explanations of options, methods, and usage instructions.  The documentation often provides troubleshooting information for common problems.\n\n\n### Error Messages\n\nTablesorter generally doesn't throw many custom error messages.  Most errors will manifest as JavaScript errors in your browser's console (e.g., \"Uncaught TypeError,\" \"Uncaught ReferenceError\"). These errors will usually indicate problems with the inclusion of necessary files, incorrect use of the API, or conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.\n\nExamine the error messages in your browser's console carefully. They usually provide clues to the source and nature of the problem, including the line number of the problematic code.

The order in which columns are clicked determines the sort order. To specify an initial multi-column sort order, use the `sortList` option:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        sortList: [[0, 1], [1, 0]] //Sort column 1 ascending, then column 2 descending\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis initializes the table sorted by column 1 ascending and then column 2 descending.\n\n\n### Filtering\n\nThe `filter` widget allows users to filter table rows based on the text content of each cell.  Enable the widget by including it in the `widgets` option:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        widgets: [\"filter\"]\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis adds a filter input field above each column header, allowing users to filter rows based on the column contents.  Consult the Tablesorter documentation for details on widget options and customization.\n\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe `pager` widget provides pagination functionality for large tables.  Enable the widget similarly to the filter:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        widgets: [\"pager\"]\n    });\n});\n```\n\nYou will also need to include appropriate HTML elements (e.g., for page navigation) as described in the plugin's documentation.\n\n\n### Widgets\n\nTablesorter's functionality is greatly extended by widgets.  Widgets add features like filtering, pagination, and styling enhancements.  Enable widgets by including their names in the `widgets` option array.  See the plugin's documentation for a complete list of available widgets and their configurations.\n\n\n### Custom Parser Functions\n\nFor data types not automatically handled by the built-in parsers, you can create custom parser functions. These functions define how data in a column should be interpreted for sorting. Refer to the Tablesorter documentation for details on creating and registering custom parsers. This involves defining a function that takes a cell's content as input and returns a value suitable for comparison.\n\n\n### Using Themes\n\nTablesorter supports various CSS themes to customize the table's appearance.  Select a theme using the `theme` option:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter({\n        theme: \"bootstrap\" // or \"blue\", \"jui\", etc.\n    });\n});\n```\n\nYou'll need the corresponding theme CSS file included in your project.\n\n\n### Accessibility\n\nEnsure your tables are accessible by following accessibility best practices. Use appropriate ARIA attributes (like `aria-sort` on headers) to improve screen reader compatibility.  Tablesorter generally supports accessibility features, but proper implementation of ARIA attributes and semantic HTML is crucial.\n\n\n### Internationalization\n\nFor internationalization support (handling different languages and locales), you might need to use a suitable date/time library and potentially create custom parsers to handle locale-specific date and number formats.  Consider using the `localeCompare` method for string comparisons to handle language-specific sorting.  The plugin itself doesn't include built-in internationalization features beyond the default capabilities of JavaScript's built-in functions.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Methods\n\nTablesorter exposes several methods for interacting with the plugin after initialization.  These methods are called on the jQuery object representing the table.  Some key methods include:\n\n* **`destroy()`:** Removes Tablesorter functionality from the table and restores the table to its original state.\n* **`addRows(rows, [update])`:** Adds new rows to the table.  The `rows` argument is an array of rows (each row can be a string of HTML or a jQuery object).  The optional `update` argument (boolean) indicates whether to update the table's sorting after adding rows.\n* **`update()`:** Re-initializes the sorting for the table.  Useful after adding, removing, or modifying rows.\n* **`sortOn(column, order)`:** Programmatically sorts the table by a specified column and order. `column` is the column index (0-based), and `order` is 0 for ascending and 1 for descending.\n* **`getSortList()`:** Returns the current sort order as an array.\n* **`setHeaderFilter(value, column)`:** Sets the filter value for a specified column. Useful for programmatic filtering.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n$(\"#myTable\").tablesorter().tablesorter(\"addRows\", [ \"<tr><td>New Row 1</td><td>Data</td></tr>\" ]);\n$(\"#myTable\").tablesorter(\"sortOn\", 0, 0); //Sort the first column ascending\nlet sortOrder = $(\"#myTable\").tablesorter(\"getSortList\");\nconsole.log(sortOrder); // Output current sort order\n```\n\nConsult the full Tablesorter documentation for a complete list of available methods and their parameters.\n\n\n### Events\n\nTablesorter triggers several events throughout its lifecycle.  These events can be used to perform custom actions based on sorting or other plugin operations.  These are jQuery events, so you can use jQuery's `on()` method to listen for them.  Some important events include:\n\n* **`sortBegin`:** Triggered before the sorting process begins.\n* **`sortEnd`:** Triggered after the sorting process is complete.\n* **`pagerComplete`:** Triggered after the pager widget completes pagination (if the pager widget is enabled).\n* **`filterStart`:** Triggered when filtering starts (filter widget).\n* **`filterEnd`:** Triggered when filtering completes (filter widget).\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n$(\"#myTable\").on(\"sortEnd\", function(e, table) {\n    console.log(\"Sorting complete!\");\n});\n```\n\n\n### Options\n\nThe options passed to the `tablesorter()` method control various aspects of the plugin's behavior. These options were discussed partially in the Basic Usage and Advanced Usage sections.  Refer to the full Tablesorter documentation for the complete list of options and their descriptions.  Options are key-value pairs within a JavaScript object.  Some of the commonly used options were already illustrated previously (e.g., `theme`, `headers`, `widgets`, `sortList`).\n\n\n### Public Properties\n\nTablesorter doesn't expose many public properties directly accessible from outside the plugin.  Information like the current sort order is usually accessed using methods like `getSortList()`.  The plugin's internal data structure is not intended for direct manipulation. The primary way to interact with the plugin is through its methods and events.  Avoid directly accessing or modifying internal plugin properties, as this might break functionality and is not supported.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nThis section addresses frequently encountered problems when using Tablesorter.\n\n* **Table not sorting:**\n    * **Problem:**  The table doesn't respond to header clicks, and no sorting occurs.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that jQuery is included *before* the Tablesorter scripts.\n        * Check your jQuery selector; ensure it correctly targets your table element.\n        * Ensure the `tablesorter()` method is called correctly within a `$(document).ready()` function.\n        * Inspect your browser's console for JavaScript errors.\n        * Check for conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.\n\n* **Incorrect sorting order:**\n    * **Problem:**  Data isn't sorted as expected (e.g., numbers treated as strings).\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Examine your data types; ensure numbers are represented numerically and dates are in a consistent format.\n        * Use the `headers` option to specify custom sorters for specific columns (see the \"Customizing Sorting\" section).\n        * Create custom parser functions to handle unusual data formats.\n\n* **Widgets not working:**\n    * **Problem:**  Features like filtering or pagination are not functional even after enabling the corresponding widgets.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that the necessary widget scripts (`jquery.tablesorter.widgets.js`) are included.\n        * Check for typos in the `widgets` option array.\n        * Ensure that the HTML structure required by the widgets is correctly implemented (refer to the widget documentation for specific requirements).\n\n* **Conflicting CSS:**\n    * **Problem:** The table's styling is overridden by other CSS rules, affecting the appearance of sorted columns or widget elements.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Use browser developer tools to inspect the CSS applied to the table and identify conflicting styles.\n        * Use more specific CSS selectors to override conflicting styles.\n        * Ensure that Tablesorter's CSS is loaded correctly and after any other conflicting stylesheets.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:**  Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Check the console for errors and warnings.  Use the network tab to ensure that all necessary files are loaded correctly.\n\n* **Console Logging:**  Add `console.log()` statements to your JavaScript code to track variable values and the execution flow.  This helps pinpoint errors in your initialization code or custom functions.\n\n* **Simplified Test Cases:**  If you are encountering issues with complex tables, try creating a simplified test case with minimal data and features. This isolates the problem and makes it easier to debug.\n\n* **jQuery Debugging:**  If you suspect jQuery-related issues, use jQuery's debugging tools or add `console.log` statements to trace jQuery's behavior in your code.\n\n* **Check the Tablesorter Documentation:**  Thoroughly read the official Tablesorter documentation for detailed explanations of options, methods, and usage instructions.  The documentation often provides troubleshooting information for common problems.\n\n\n### Error Messages\n\nTablesorter generally doesn't throw many custom error messages.  Most errors will manifest as JavaScript errors in your browser's console (e.g., \"Uncaught TypeError,\" \"Uncaught ReferenceError\"). These errors will usually indicate problems with the inclusion of necessary files, incorrect use of the API, or conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.\n\nExamine the error messages in your browser's console carefully. They usually provide clues to the source and nature of the problem, including the line number of the problematic code.  If the error message is unclear, try the debugging tips described above to pinpoint the cause.  If you are unable to resolve the issue, check the Tablesorter's issue tracker or community forums for assistance.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to Tablesorter!
