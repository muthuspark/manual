### Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Headhesive can be easily integrated into your project using npm or a CDN.

**1. Using npm:**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install headhesive
   ```

   Then, import it into your JavaScript file:

   ```javascript
   import Headhesive from 'headhesive';

   // Your Headhesive code here...
   ```

**2. Using a CDN:**

   Include the Headhesive script in your HTML file's `<head>`:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/headhesive@latest/dist/headhesive.min.js"></script>
   ```

   Ensure this script is included *before* you attempt to use Headhesive in your JavaScript code.

**Basic Usage:**

After installation, you can initialize Headhesive with a simple configuration:

```javascript
const options = {
  offset: 0, // Adjust vertical offset
  offset_top: 0, // Adjust top offset
  classes: {
    clone: 'headhesive-clone', // Adjust class names as needed
    stuck: 'headhesive-stuck'
  },
  // More options available... refer to complete documentation
}

const element = document.querySelector('#my-sticky-element');
const headhesive = new Headhesive(element, options);
```

Remember to replace `'#my-sticky-element'` with the CSS selector for the element you want to make sticky.  Consult the full documentation for detailed information on available options and advanced usage.


## Core Concepts

### Data Structures

Headhesive primarily utilizes JavaScript objects to manage its internal state and configurations.  The core data structure is the options object passed to the `Headhesive` constructor. This object allows for highly customizable behavior.  Internally, Headhesive uses a combination of objects and arrays to track the positions of elements, handle collisions, and manage event listeners.  While developers don't directly interact with these internal structures, understanding their general nature helps in troubleshooting and optimizing performance. The key properties within the options object are documented separately.


### Headhesive Objects

The central component is the `Headhesive` object itself, created by instantiating the `Headhesive` class. This object manages the sticky element and its associated behavior.  It contains methods for controlling the sticky element's state (e.g., sticking, unsticking) and accessing its properties.  Each instance of `Headhesive` is independent and manages a single sticky element.  Notably, there's no inherent data sharing between different `Headhesive` objects; each operates autonomously.

### Working with the DOM

Headhesive manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to achieve its sticky behavior.  It typically creates a clone of the target element to handle the sticky effect. This clone is positioned absolutely and updated dynamically as the user scrolls. The original element remains in its place within the document's flow.  Interactions with the cloned element are usually (but not necessarily) relayed back to the original element. Understanding this cloning mechanism is key to grasping how Headhesive interacts with other elements and scripts on the page.  It's crucial to ensure that your CSS selectors and event listeners consider both the original element and its clone.


### Event Handling

Headhesive triggers several events throughout its lifecycle, offering opportunities for custom actions based on the sticky element's state. While specific events and their accompanying data are documented elsewhere, the general approach involves attaching event listeners to the `Headhesive` object. This allows developers to react to events like the element becoming sticky, becoming unsticky, or encountering collisions with other elements. These events facilitate advanced customizations, such as triggering animations or updating other UI elements.


### Asynchronous Operations

Headhesive itself doesn't perform inherently asynchronous operations; all its core functionality is synchronous.  However, the events triggered by Headhesive can be used to initiate asynchronous tasks (e.g., making an API request when an element becomes sticky). Developers are responsible for managing the asynchronous parts of their application using techniques like promises or async/await, ensuring these actions don't block the main thread and thus impact the performance of Headhesive's sticky behavior. The library is designed to be non-blocking and efficient, but any external asynchronous operations triggered in response to Headhesive events should be written with performance in mind.


## API Reference

### Headhesive Constructor

The `Headhesive` constructor creates a new `Headhesive` object, initiating the sticky behavior for a specified DOM element.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
new Headhesive(element, options);
```

**Parameters:**

* `element`:  (Required) A DOM element (or a CSS selector string) representing the element to make sticky.  This element will be cloned to create the sticky effect.
* `options`: (Optional) An object containing configuration options (see below).  If omitted, default settings are used.

**Example:**

```javascript
const element = document.getElementById('myStickyElement');
const headhesiveInstance = new Headhesive(element, { offset: 20 });
```


### Methods

Headhesive offers several methods to interact with the sticky element:

* **`destroy()`:** Removes the sticky behavior from the element.  This reverses any changes made to the DOM by Headhesive and removes all event listeners.

* **`unStick()`:**  Forces the element to become unsticky, regardless of the scroll position.

* **`reStick()`:** Recalculates the sticky state based on current scroll position. Useful after DOM manipulations that might affect the element's position or size.


### Properties

The `Headhesive` object exposes the following properties:

* **`stuck`:** (Read-only) A boolean indicating whether the element is currently stuck (true) or not (false).

* **`element`:** (Read-only) The original DOM element that was passed to the constructor.

* **`clone`:** (Read-only) The cloned DOM element used for the sticky behavior.

* **`options`:** (Read-only) The configuration options object used to initialize the `Headhesive` instance.



### Events

Headhesive triggers custom events on the associated element during its lifecycle.  You can listen for these events using standard JavaScript event listeners.  All events are dispatched on the *original* element passed to the constructor, not the clone.


* **`headhesive:stuck`:** Fired when the element becomes stuck.  The event object contains no additional data.

* **`headhesive:unstuck`:** Fired when the element becomes unstuck.  The event object contains no additional data.

* **`headhesive:collision`:** Fired when a collision occurs with another element. The event object may contain data specifying the colliding element.  (Implementation details of collision data are subject to change.)


**Example Event Listener:**

```javascript
const element = document.getElementById('myStickyElement');
const headhesiveInstance = new Headhesive(element);

element.addEventListener('headhesive:stuck', () => {
  console.log('Element is now stuck!');
});
```

Note:  The specific data structure within event objects (especially for `headhesive:collision`) might evolve in future versions, so always refer to the latest documentation for the most up-to-date details.


## Advanced Techniques

### Customizing Headhesive

Headhesive's flexibility extends beyond its core features through its configuration options.  The `options` object passed to the constructor allows for fine-grained control over many aspects of its behavior.  For instance, you can adjust the `offset` to control the distance between the top of the viewport and the sticky element, or modify `classes` to use custom CSS class names for the clone element.  Explore the full list of options in the detailed documentation for a comprehensive understanding of customization possibilities.  You can also manipulate the cloned element directly using CSS to style it further or integrate it with other UI components.

### Extending Headhesive

While Headhesive offers a comprehensive set of features, developers may need to add specialized behavior. This can be achieved by leveraging its event system.  By listening for events like `headhesive:stuck` and `headhesive:unstuck`, you can trigger custom functions in response to changes in the sticky element's state.  This enables integrating custom animations, data updates, or interactions with other parts of your application.  More complex extensions might require creating a custom plugin or subclassing the `Headhesive` class, but utilizing the existing event-driven architecture is often sufficient for most customization needs.


### Integration with Other Libraries

Headhesive is designed to work seamlessly alongside other JavaScript libraries.  Its compact nature and DOM-centric approach minimizes conflicts.  However, careful consideration should be given to potential interactions with libraries that also manipulate the DOM or manage scroll behavior.  For instance, ensure that you don't have conflicting CSS rules that could interfere with Headhesive's positioning.  When working with libraries that modify scroll behavior (e.g., parallax scrolling libraries), test thoroughly to avoid unexpected behavior and potential conflicts.  Prioritize efficient and clean interactions, avoiding direct manipulation of Headhesive's internal state or elements.


### Performance Optimization

While Headhesive is designed for performance, optimizing its usage within your application can further enhance its efficiency.  Avoid unnecessarily frequent calls to `reStick()`; only use this method when necessary after significant DOM modifications. Minimize the size and complexity of the target element.  Large and complex elements can impact rendering performance.  Ensure that your CSS selectors are efficient and specific to avoid unnecessary DOM traversal.  If performance becomes a critical bottleneck, consider profiling your application to identify areas for improvement.  Remember to always test with realistic datasets and user scenarios to assess the impact of any changes.


### Debugging and Troubleshooting

Debugging issues with Headhesive often involves inspecting the DOM and understanding its interactions with other parts of your application. Your browser's developer tools (especially the Elements and Console panels) are invaluable for this process.  Check for conflicting CSS rules that might interfere with the element's positioning. Use the browser's console to log the `stuck` property of the `Headhesive` instance to monitor the sticky state.  If you encounter unexpected behavior, review the event logs and check for any error messages.  Simplify your setup to isolate potential conflicts; try using a minimal example to reproduce the problem.  Remember to check for updates to Headhesive; newer versions may address bugs or introduce performance improvements.  If you are still unable to resolve an issue, providing a minimal, reproducible example helps others assist you with debugging.


## Examples and Use Cases

### Simple Example

This example demonstrates the most basic implementation of Headhesive, creating a sticky header:

**HTML (index.html):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Headhesive Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header id="myHeader">This is the header</header>
  <main>
    <p>Some content...</p>
    <p>More content...</p>
    <p>Even more content...</p>
  </main>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS (styles.css):**

```css
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
}
```


**JavaScript (script.js):**

```javascript
import Headhesive from 'headhesive';

const header = document.getElementById('myHeader');
new Headhesive(header);
```

This code will make the header element (`#myHeader`) sticky.  Remember to install Headhesive using npm or include it via a CDN as described in the "Getting Started" section.


### Complex Example

This example demonstrates more advanced usage, including offset and custom class names:

```javascript
import Headhesive from 'headhesive';

const header = document.getElementById('myHeader');
const options = {
  offset: 50, // Add a 50px offset from the top
  classes: {
    clone: 'my-sticky-clone',
    stuck: 'my-sticky-stuck'
  },
  onStick: () => { console.log("Header is stuck!"); },
  onUnstick: () => { console.log("Header is unstuck!"); }
};

new Headhesive(header, options);
```

This code adds a 50px top offset before the header becomes sticky and uses custom classes ('my-sticky-clone', 'my-sticky-stuck') for styling. The `onStick` and `onUnstick` callbacks demonstrate event handling. You would need to add corresponding CSS rules for the custom classes.


### Real-world Application Scenarios

Headhesive is applicable in various scenarios:

* **Sticky Navigation:** Create a header or navigation bar that remains visible while scrolling.
* **Persistent Sidebars:**  Maintain a sidebar fixed to the left or right of the viewport.
* **Always-Visible Footers:**  Keep important information in a footer permanently visible even when content extends beyond the screen height.
* **In-Page Table of Contents:** A table of contents that stays visible as the user scrolls through a long document.
* **Sticky Call-to-Action Elements:** Keep a prominent call-to-action button always in view.
* **Interactive Elements:**  Combine Headhesive with other libraries to create interactive sticky elements with animations or dynamic content updates.  For example, a sticky shopping cart that updates its contents as items are added.

These are just a few examples; Headhesive's versatility allows for a wide array of applications in creating enhanced user experiences. Remember to adapt the code and configuration based on your specific design and requirements.
