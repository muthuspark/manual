### What is Selectivizr?

Selectivizr is a small JavaScript library that enables the use of CSS3 selectors in Internet Explorer versions 6-8.  These older versions of IE have limited support for modern CSS selectors, meaning styles written using selectors like `:first-child`, `:nth-child`, `:hover`, and many others would not be applied correctly or at all. Selectivizr bridges this gap by emulating the behavior of these selectors, allowing developers to use current best practices in their CSS without needing to write separate stylesheets or use conditional comments for older IE versions.  It achieves this by parsing the CSS and applying the styles appropriately using JavaScript.


### Why use Selectivizr?

Using Selectivizr offers several key advantages:

* **Maintainable CSS:**  Write cleaner, more concise CSS using modern selectors.  You don't need to maintain separate stylesheets for different browsers. This simplifies your workflow and reduces the risk of inconsistencies.
* **Improved Code Readability:** Your CSS will be easier to understand and maintain when you don't have to work around IE's limitations with hacks and conditional comments.
* **Progressive Enhancement:** Selectivizr provides a graceful fallback for older browsers, ensuring your site still functions correctly, albeit without the full styling benefits of modern CSS, in older IE versions.  Modern browsers will ignore Selectivizr, allowing them to render the CSS natively for optimal performance.
* **Easier Development:** Focus on writing clean, well-structured CSS, without needing to constantly account for the idiosyncrasies of older IE.


### Browser Compatibility

Selectivizr is designed to work in Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8.  It does *not* need to be included in modern browsers (IE9 and above, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) as these browsers natively support the CSS selectors Selectivizr emulates.  In fact, including Selectivizr in modern browsers will have no effect.


### Installation and Setup

1. **Download:** Download the latest version of Selectivizr from [insert download link here].  The file will be a single `.js` file (e.g., `selectivizr.js`).

2. **Include in your HTML:** Place the `selectivizr.js` file in your project's JavaScript directory.  Then, include it in your HTML `<head>` section just before the closing `</head>` tag.  This ensures the script runs after the stylesheets have been parsed. For example:

   ```html
   <head>
       <!-- ... other head elements ... -->
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
       <script src="selectivizr.js"></script>
   </head>
   ```

3. **No further configuration is usually needed.** Selectivizr automatically detects and applies the necessary corrections.  However, for very complex stylesheets or specific issues, you may need to consult the [link to advanced usage/troubleshooting section if available].


## Core Functionality

### Enabling Selectivizr

Selectivizr's core functionality is activated simply by including the `selectivizr.js` file in your HTML document's `<head>`, as described in the Installation and Setup section.  No additional configuration or JavaScript calls are typically required.  Selectivizr automatically detects if it's needed (i.e., running in an older version of Internet Explorer) and applies its emulation layer.  It passively analyzes your CSS and modifies the DOM accordingly to simulate the behavior of unsupported selectors.  Modern browsers will simply ignore the script.


### How Selectivizr Works

Selectivizr operates by parsing the CSS stylesheets linked in your HTML document.  When it encounters a CSS selector that's not natively supported by the browser, it uses JavaScript to dynamically analyze the DOM and apply the corresponding styles.  This is done by traversing the document and identifying elements that match the selector, then applying the relevant styles to those elements.  For example, if a `:first-child` selector is used, Selectivizr will identify the first child element within each parent and apply the corresponding styles. The process is transparent to the user; they simply see the correct styling applied as if the browser natively supported the selectors.  It's crucial to understand that this is a DOM manipulation process and may slightly impact page load performance. However, the performance impact is generally negligible compared to the benefits of using modern CSS.

### Supported CSS Selectors

Selectivizr provides support for a wide range of CSS3 selectors that are typically unsupported in older versions of Internet Explorer.  This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Attribute selectors:**  `[attribute]`, `[attribute=value]`, `[attribute~=value]`, `[attribute|=value]`, `[attribute^=value]`, `[attribute$=value]`, `[attribute*=value]`
* **Pseudo-classes:** `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, `:link`, `:visited`, `:first-child`, `:last-child`, `:nth-child(n)`, `:nth-last-child(n)`, `:only-child`, `:empty`, `:target`, `:checked`, `:enabled`, `:disabled`, `:not(selector)`
* **Pseudo-elements:** `::before`, `::after` (note: content manipulation for pseudo-elements is limited; it's recommended to use JavaScript for more complex pseudo-element manipulations)


While Selectivizr strives for broad compatibility,  there might be very edge cases of complex selector combinations that are not fully supported.  If you encounter issues, please consult the [link to troubleshooting section if available].


### Limitations of Selectivizr

While Selectivizr is a powerful tool, it has some limitations:

* **Performance:**  Because Selectivizr uses JavaScript to emulate CSS selectors, there might be a slight performance overhead, especially on pages with complex stylesheets and many elements.  However, this overhead is generally minimal and often outweighed by the benefits of using modern CSS.

* **JavaScript Dependency:** Selectivizr requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser.  Users with JavaScript disabled will not see the styles applied correctly.

* **Complex Selectors:** Although Selectivizr supports a wide range of selectors, extremely complex or nested selectors might not always be perfectly emulated.

* **Dynamic Content:** Selectivizr primarily works on static content. While it attempts to handle some dynamic content updates,  it might not be as efficient in scenarios with frequent DOM changes or heavy use of AJAX.  In such cases, consider alternative approaches.

* **Pseudo-element Content Manipulation:**  While Selectivizr supports `::before` and `::after`,  complex manipulation of their content (beyond simple text) may require additional JavaScript code.


It's important to weigh these limitations against the advantages of using modern CSS before implementing Selectivizr. For most projects, the benefits significantly outweigh the drawbacks.


## Advanced Usage

### Conditional Statements

While Selectivizr primarily focuses on enabling CSS3 selectors, you can still use conditional comments within your CSS to target specific browser versions if needed.  Selectivizr will not interfere with these conditional comments.  For example:

```css
<!--[if lte IE 8]>
  /* Styles specific to IE 8 and below */
  .element {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
<![endif]-->

/* Styles for all other browsers */
.element {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

In this example, the yellow background will only apply to IE 8 and below, while blue will be applied to all other browsers, including those where Selectivizr is used to enable the other selectors within the same stylesheet.  This allows for targeted styling adjustments even when using Selectivizr.


### Customizing Selectivizr

Selectivizr offers minimal customization options.  The library is designed to be largely self-contained and requires no direct configuration.  Any modifications to the core `selectivizr.js` file are strongly discouraged, as they may break functionality and prevent future updates from working correctly.  Customizing the behavior of Selectivizr is best achieved by using conditional comments or separate CSS rules that target specific situations, as outlined in the previous section.


### Integration with Other Libraries

Selectivizr generally integrates well with other JavaScript libraries.  However,  it's important to ensure that Selectivizr is included *after* other libraries that might manipulate the DOM.  This ensures that Selectivizr operates on the fully rendered and updated DOM. If conflicts occur, carefully check the loading order of your scripts in your HTML file.  As always, avoid modifying the Selectivizr source directly.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Styles not applying:** Double-check that `selectivizr.js` is included correctly in your HTML `<head>` section, *after* your stylesheets. Ensure the file path is accurate.  Also, verify that JavaScript is enabled in the user's browser.

* **Performance issues:** If you experience significant performance problems, consider optimizing your CSS and potentially breaking down complex styles into smaller, more manageable stylesheets.  Avoid using overly complex selectors.  Excessive DOM manipulation could also slow down page load.

* **Selector conflicts:** If Selectivizr's emulated selectors conflict with other CSS rules, try being more specific in your selectors.  Using more precise selectors can help resolve such conflicts.

* **Dynamic content issues:** Selectivizr might not handle dynamic content changes as seamlessly as with static content. If facing issues with dynamically added elements, consider using JavaScript to re-apply Selectivizr's functionality to the new elements after they are added to the DOM.  This typically means using a combination of event listeners and custom code to trigger Selectivizr on the newly created elements.

* **Pseudo-element issues:**  Remember that content manipulation for pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) might require additional JavaScript to handle complex content beyond simple text.

If you encounter issues not covered here, refer to the [link to more extensive troubleshooting resources, if available] or consider posting your question on relevant developer forums or communities.  Always provide details like your browser version, relevant code snippets, and a clear description of the problem when seeking assistance.


## Best Practices

### Writing Efficient CSS

To maximize the performance of Selectivizr (and your website in general), it's crucial to write efficient and well-structured CSS.  Here are some key recommendations:

* **Use specific selectors:** Avoid overly generic selectors.  The more specific your selectors, the fewer elements Selectivizr needs to process, resulting in faster performance.

* **Minimize nesting:** Deeply nested selectors can increase processing time.  Aim for a flatter CSS structure where possible.

* **Avoid unnecessary selectors:** Don't use selectors that are redundant or don't contribute to the final styling.

* **Optimize your CSS structure:** Properly organize your CSS with clear class names and consistent naming conventions. This improves readability and maintainability, making it easier to identify potential performance bottlenecks.

* **Use CSS preprocessors (with caution):** Tools like Sass or Less can improve CSS organization and maintainability, but be aware that the output CSS needs to be well-structured for optimal performance with Selectivizr.  Avoid excessive nesting or unnecessarily complex selector combinations within your preprocessor code.

* **Combine selectors when possible:**  If multiple selectors apply the same styles, try to combine them using commas to reduce redundancy.


### Optimizing Selectivizr Performance

While Selectivizr is generally lightweight, you can further improve its performance by following these guidelines:

* **Minimize the use of complex selectors:**  Avoid very complex or deeply nested selectors as much as possible.  These require more processing by Selectivizr.

* **Optimize your HTML structure:** A well-structured HTML document simplifies DOM traversal for Selectivizr, leading to faster processing.

* **Avoid excessive DOM manipulation:**  If your page heavily relies on dynamic DOM changes (e.g., through AJAX), consider applying Selectivizr to new elements only after they are added to the DOM, instead of relying solely on its automatic detection.

* **Load Selectivizr strategically:**  Make sure it's loaded only when necessary (in older IE versions) and after CSS is loaded to avoid conflicts.

* **Test and profile:** Use browser developer tools to profile your page's performance and identify any bottlenecks related to Selectivizr.


### Maintaining Compatibility

Even with Selectivizr, always validate your CSS and test thoroughly across different versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, and 8).  Pay close attention to how dynamic content interacts with your styles.   Consider using a testing framework or automated testing tools to ensure consistent styling and functionality across all supported browsers.  Remember that Selectivizr is a *polyfill*—a way to bridge the gaps in older browsers; it doesn't provide perfect feature parity with modern browsers.  You might still need to employ conditional comments or other techniques for very specific styling quirks in those older IEs.


### Alternatives to Selectivizr

While Selectivizr is an effective solution for many, consider these alternatives:

* **Modern browsers:** The best way to ensure full CSS3 selector support is to encourage users to upgrade to modern browsers.  This eliminates the need for any polyfills.

* **CSS resets/normalizers:**  Tools like Normalize.css can help standardize styling across browsers, reducing the need for browser-specific CSS hacks and potentially reducing the reliance on Selectivizr for some basic styling concerns.

* **Feature detection:** Using feature detection techniques (checking for native support of specific selectors using JavaScript), you can conditionally load Selectivizr or apply alternative styles only when needed.

* **Conditional comments and CSS hacks:**  Though less elegant, conditional comments and browser-specific CSS hacks provide a more direct method for addressing individual styling issues in older IE versions, avoiding the need for Selectivizr in some cases.  However, this approach typically leads to more complex and less maintainable code.

The choice of alternative depends on your project requirements and priorities.  If maintaining compatibility with older IE versions is crucial and the CSS is complex, Selectivizr remains a robust option; but for simpler styling needs or with a more modern browser focus, other approaches may be preferable.
