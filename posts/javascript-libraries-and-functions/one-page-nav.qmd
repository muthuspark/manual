## Getting Started

### Installation

One Page Nav can be installed in several ways:

* **Download:** Download the latest version of One Page Nav from [Insert Download Link Here]. Extract the contents and include the necessary files in your project.

* **CDN:** Include One Page Nav via a CDN.  A popular option is [Insert CDN Link Here], allowing you to use One Page Nav without downloading it.  Note that using a CDN relies on an external server, so consider the implications for your project's reliability.

* **npm:** If you're using npm, install One Page Nav via the command line:  `npm install one-page-nav`

* **Yarn:** If you're using Yarn, install One Page Nav via the command line: `yarn add one-page-nav`


### Basic Setup and Configuration

After installation, you'll need to include the jQuery library (One Page Nav is a jQuery plugin) and the One Page Nav JavaScript file in your project.  Then,  you'll initialize the plugin on your navigation element using a simple jQuery call, passing any necessary options.  The basic setup involves selecting your navigation menu and calling the `onePageNav` function.  Configuration options allow you to tailor the plugin's behavior (e.g., scroll speed, animation, etc.).  Refer to the Options section for a full list of available options and their descriptions.


### Including the Script

Include both jQuery and the One Page Nav JavaScript file in your HTML's `<head>` section or before the closing `</body>` tag. Ensure that jQuery is included *before* the One Page Nav script.  An example using a CDN for jQuery and a local copy of One Page Nav would be:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/onepage-nav.min.js"></script>
```

Replace `"js/onepage-nav.min.js"` with the actual path to your One Page Nav JavaScript file.


### HTML Structure Requirements

Your HTML needs to have a navigation menu (typically an unordered list `<ul>`) and sections on the page that correspond to the navigation links.  Each `<a>` element within the navigation list should have an `href` attribute linking to an ID of a section on the same page (e.g., `#section1`, `#section2`).  These section IDs should be present in your page content as `id` attributes for the corresponding `<section>` or `<div>` elements.

Example:

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<section id="section1">...</section>
<section id="section2">...</section>
<section id="section3">...</section>
```

Make sure your section IDs are unique and consistently match the `href` values in your navigation links.  Proper HTML structure is crucial for One Page Nav to function correctly.


## Configuration Options

One Page Nav offers several configuration options to customize its behavior and appearance. These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `onePageNav` function.

### Navigation Item Selector

Specifies the CSS selector for the navigation items.  This defaults to `'nav a'`, targeting all anchor elements within a `<nav>` element.  If your navigation links are located elsewhere, adjust this selector accordingly.  For example, if your links are within a `div` with the class "menu", use  `'.menu a'`.

### Section Selector

Specifies the CSS selector for the page sections. This defaults to `'section'`, targeting all `<section>` elements. Change this if your sections are using different HTML tags (e.g., `'div'` for `'div.section'` or `'.my-sections'`.)

### Navigation Speed

Controls the speed of the scrolling animation in milliseconds.  The default is 750. Increase this value for slower scrolling, decrease it for faster scrolling.


### Smooth Scrolling

A boolean value (true/false) indicating whether to use smooth scrolling.  Defaults to `true`. Setting it to `false` will result in instant jumps to the sections.


### Offset

Specifies the vertical offset (in pixels) from the top of the window to which the page will scroll. This is useful for accounting for fixed headers or other elements that might obscure the top of the section. The default is 0.  For example, an offset of 50 would scroll 50 pixels below the top of the section.


### Current Class

Specifies the CSS class applied to the currently active navigation item. The default is `'current'`.  You can change this to any class name you prefer.


### Disable Mousewheel

A boolean value (true/false) that enables or disables the use of the mousewheel to scroll between sections. Defaults to `false` (mousewheel scrolling enabled).  Setting it to `true` will disable mousewheel scrolling.


### Filter

This option allows you to filter the links that One Page Nav will manage. It takes a function as its value. This function receives the link element as an argument, and should return `true` if the link should be managed by One Page Nav, and `false` otherwise. This can be useful to exclude certain links from the plugin's functionality.


### Advanced Configuration

For more advanced customizations, including event handling and extending the plugin's core functionality, refer to the  [Advanced Usage] section of the documentation. (Note: Replace "[Advanced Usage]" with an actual link if available in your documentation).  This section will cover topics such as extending the plugin with custom events and methods.


## Usage and Customization

This section details how to implement One Page Nav and customize its behavior to fit your project's needs.

### Basic Implementation

The most basic implementation involves including the necessary scripts (jQuery and One Page Nav) and initializing the plugin on your navigation element.  Assuming your navigation list is within a `<nav>` element with the ID "mainNav",  and you have sections with appropriate IDs, the JavaScript initialization would be:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#mainNav').onePageNav();
});
```

This will apply the default settings. To use custom settings, pass an options object as an argument:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#mainNav').onePageNav({
    currentClass: 'active',
    scrollSpeed: 1000,
    scrollThreshold: 0.5
  });
});
```

Remember to replace `'#mainNav'` with the appropriate selector for your navigation element.


### Customizing Navigation Styles

You can fully customize the visual style of your navigation menu using CSS.  Apply classes or IDs to the navigation element and its children (list items, links) and style them as needed.  One Page Nav itself does not impose any specific styling; it only manages the behavior of the scrolling.  The `currentClass` option (see Configuration Options) controls the class applied to the active navigation item; use CSS to style this class appropriately.


### Adding Animations

One Page Nav already incorporates smooth scrolling, but you can enhance this with additional animations using CSS transitions or animations.  Target the sections themselves and style transitions for properties like `opacity`, `transform` (for scale or other effects), or `filter` (for blur or other effects).  You will need to consider the timing of these animations in relation to the scrolling speed (`scrollSpeed` option) provided to One Page Nav.


### Handling Events

One Page Nav provides several events that you can hook into for more advanced control.  These events include `start`, `end`, `scroll`, and `scrollend`. You can listen to these events using jQuery's `on()` method. For instance:

```javascript
$('#mainNav').onePageNav({
  beforePage: function(index) {
    //Code to execute before a page is loaded
    console.log("Before page load: " + index);
  },
  afterPage: function(index) {
    //Code to execute after a page is loaded
    console.log("After page load: " + index);
  }
});
```

Refer to the complete list of events in the [Events] section (Replace "[Events]" with actual link if available).


### Integration with Other Libraries

One Page Nav is designed to work well with other JavaScript libraries.  Since it's a jQuery plugin, it's compatible with many other jQuery-based plugins.  However, ensure that there are no conflicts in terms of event handling or DOM manipulation.  If issues arise, you may need to adjust the initialization order of the scripts or use appropriate methods to prevent conflicts.  Thorough testing is recommended when integrating with other libraries.


## Advanced Techniques

This section covers more advanced usage scenarios and best practices for using One Page Nav.


### Programmatic Navigation Control

You can control One Page Nav programmatically using its methods.  For example, you can navigate to a specific section using the `$.fn.onePageNav.scrollTo()` method.  This allows you to trigger navigation from other parts of your application, such as from a button click or other user interaction.  You'll pass the index of the section or the section ID to this method.  Refer to the API documentation for a complete list of available methods.


### Dynamic Content Updates

If your page content changes dynamically after the initial page load (e.g., via AJAX), you might need to re-initialize One Page Nav.  This ensures that the plugin correctly updates its internal state to reflect the changes in the DOM.  Call the `onePageNav()` function again after the content has been updated.  Make sure you are using the correct selectors to target your navigation and sections after the dynamic update.  You may need to use event listeners to detect when the content updates to trigger the re-initialization.


### Responsive Design

One Page Nav is inherently responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.  However, you should carefully consider the responsiveness of your overall design. Ensure your navigation menu and sections are styled appropriately for various screen sizes using media queries.  Pay particular attention to the visual layout of your sections and the ease of navigation on smaller screens.


### Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is crucial.  Ensure that your navigation is usable by individuals with disabilities.  Use appropriate ARIA attributes to enhance the accessibility of your navigation menu.  For example, use ARIA labels for links and ensure proper keyboard navigation.  Use semantic HTML elements appropriately, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret your site's structure.  Consider providing alternative ways to navigate the page, such as a jump menu or keyboard shortcuts, for users who may not be able to use a mouse.  Thoroughly test the accessibility of your implementation using assistive technologies.


## Troubleshooting

This section provides guidance on resolving common issues encountered when using One Page Nav.


### Common Issues and Solutions

* **Navigation not working:** Double-check that jQuery is included *before* the One Page Nav script. Verify that your navigation links have correct `href` attributes pointing to valid section IDs.  Ensure that your section IDs match the `href` values exactly (case-sensitive).  Inspect your HTML structure to ensure it conforms to the requirements outlined in the HTML Structure Requirements section.

* **Incorrect scrolling position:** Verify the `offset` option is correctly set to account for fixed headers or other elements at the top of the page.  Inspect your CSS for any unintended margins or paddings affecting the positioning of your sections.

* **No smooth scrolling:**  Check that the `smoothScroll` option is set to `true` (its default value).  Ensure that your browser supports smooth scrolling and that no other JavaScript code is interfering with the scrolling behavior.

* **Active class not applied:** Verify the `currentClass` option is correctly set and that you've styled the class in your CSS. Make sure that the class is being applied by inspecting your element's attributes using your browser's developer tools.

* **Conflicts with other plugins:** If you're using other JavaScript libraries, particularly those affecting scrolling or DOM manipulation, ensure there's no conflict between those libraries and One Page Nav.  Try disabling other plugins temporarily to isolate the issue.


### Debugging Tips

* **Inspect the console:** Use your browser's developer console (usually opened with F12) to check for JavaScript errors.  These errors often provide valuable clues about the cause of the problem.

* **Use your browser's developer tools:** Use the developer tools to inspect the HTML and CSS of your page to verify that the structure and styling are correct.  Check the network tab to confirm that the necessary JavaScript files are being loaded and there are no network errors.

* **Simplify your code:** Create a minimal example to isolate the problem.  Start with a simple HTML structure and gradually add components until you identify the problematic code.

* **Test in different browsers:** Test your website in multiple browsers to rule out browser-specific issues.


### Troubleshooting Browser Compatibility

One Page Nav is designed to work across modern browsers. However, very old or outdated browsers might have limited support for some features, such as smooth scrolling. If compatibility issues arise with older browsers, you may need to consider using polyfills or alternative approaches for those specific browsers.  Test across a range of browsers to ensure a consistent experience.


### Error Handling

One Page Nav provides events that allow you to handle potential errors gracefully.  For instance, you can use the `beforePage` and `afterPage` events to add custom error handling. If an issue occurs during navigation, you can use these events to log the error or provide a user-friendly message. You can also add custom error handling in case of unexpected behaviors using a `try...catch` block in your JavaScript code that initializes or uses One Page Nav.


## API Reference

This section details the methods, events, and properties available for interacting with One Page Nav.  Note that the specific methods, events, and properties available might vary depending on the version of the plugin.  Always refer to the latest documentation for the most up-to-date information.


### Methods

* **`$.fn.onePageNav.updateNav(index)`:** Updates the navigation highlighting based on the provided index.  This is helpful if you're dynamically changing the page content and need to ensure the active link is correctly displayed.  `index` represents the 0-based index of the section to highlight.

* **`$.fn.onePageNav.scrollTo(target)`:** Scrolls to a specific section.  `target` can be either the index (0-based) of the section or a valid CSS selector (e.g., "#section2"). This allows you to programmatically control navigation.

* **`$.fn.onePageNav.destroy()`:** Removes One Page Nav's functionality from the element. This is useful if you need to completely remove the plugin, for example, if you're dynamically switching between different navigation styles.

* **`$.fn.onePageNav.options`:** Returns the current options object that is used by One Page Nav plugin.  This can be used to get the current configuration without having to re-declare them.


### Events

One Page Nav triggers several events that you can listen for using jQuery's `on()` method:

* **`beforePage`:** Triggered before a page is scrolled to. The event object contains the `index` of the target section.

* **`afterPage`:** Triggered after a page is scrolled to. The event object contains the `index` of the target section.

* **`scroll`:** Triggered during the scrolling animation.  The event object contains the `index` of the current section and the `scrollPercent` value representing the current scrolling progress (0-100).

* **`scrollend`:** Triggered when the scrolling animation completes. The event object contains the `index` of the target section.

To listen for these events, use code like this:

```javascript
$('#myNav').on('beforePage', function(event) {
  console.log("Before page: " + event.index);
});
```


### Properties

One Page Nav doesn't expose public properties directly in the same way as it exposes methods. The options object passed during initialization becomes the internal configuration. You can access the options using `$.fn.onePageNav.options` after One Page Nav has been initialized.  This allows you to retrieve the current configuration settings for the plugin. However, directly modifying this object after initialization might not always reflect the plugin's behavior reliably; it is better to re-initialize the plugin with updated options.

Remember to always consult the plugin's specific documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information about its API.


## Examples

This section provides several examples demonstrating various aspects of using One Page Nav.  These examples assume you have included the necessary jQuery and One Page Nav JavaScript files.  Remember to adapt the selectors to match your specific HTML structure.


### Simple Example

This example showcases the most basic implementation of One Page Nav with default settings:

**HTML:**

```html
<nav id="mainNav">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<section id="section1">Section 1 Content</section>
<section id="section2">Section 2 Content</section>
<section id="section3">Section 3 Content</section>
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#mainNav').onePageNav();
});
```


### Example with Custom Styling

This example demonstrates how to customize the appearance of the navigation and sections using CSS:

**HTML:** (Same as Simple Example)

**CSS:**

```css
#mainNav {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}

#mainNav a {
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
}

#mainNav a.active {
  color: gold;
}

section {
  padding: 50px 0;
  text-align: center;
}

#section1 {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#section2 {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

#section3 {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

**JavaScript:** (Same as Simple Example)


### Example with Animations

This example incorporates CSS transitions for a more visually appealing scroll effect:

**HTML:** (Same as Simple Example)

**CSS:**

```css
section {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

section.active {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#mainNav').onePageNav({
    scrollSpeed: 1000 // Adjust scrolling speed if needed
  });
});

```


### Example with Dynamic Content

This example shows how to handle dynamically added content. Note that this requires additional logic to re-initialize One Page Nav after the content is added:


**HTML:** (Initially only contains the navigation and one section)

```html
<nav id="mainNav">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<section id="section1">Section 1 Content</section>

<div id="content-container"></div>
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#mainNav').onePageNav();

  //Simulate dynamic content addition (replace with your actual content loading mechanism)
  setTimeout(function() {
      $('#content-container').append('<section id="section2">Dynamically added content</section>');
      $('#mainNav ul').append('<li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>');
      $('#mainNav').onePageNav('updateNav'); //Re-initialize
  }, 3000);
});
```

Remember that these are simplified examples.  Adapt them based on your specific design and requirements.  Always consult the API reference for detailed information on options and events.
