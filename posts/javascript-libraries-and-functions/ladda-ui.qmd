### Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Ladda UI is available via npm and a CDN.

**Using npm:**

1. Install Ladda using npm:  `npm install ladda`
2. Include Ladda in your project:  `import Ladda from 'ladda';`  (or the appropriate ES module import for your setup)
3. Initialize Ladda on your buttons: see the examples in the Ladda documentation for usage instructions.


**Using a CDN:**

1. Include the Ladda JavaScript file in your HTML `<head>`:  `<script src="https://path/to/ladda.min.js"></script>` (replace with the actual CDN path)
2.  Initialize Ladda on your buttons.  Refer to the documentation for usage details.  Note that the CDN path might change over time; please check the official Ladda repository for the most up-to-date link.

After including Ladda,  you'll typically use JavaScript to instantiate a `Ladda` object on the button element you wish to enhance.  This object provides methods to start and stop the loading animation.  Refer to the Ladda project's documentation for complete usage instructions and examples.


### Browser Compatibility

Ladda UI aims for broad browser compatibility.  It's designed to work reliably in modern browsers including:

* Google Chrome (latest versions)
* Mozilla Firefox (latest versions)
* Safari (latest versions)
* Microsoft Edge (latest versions)
* Internet Explorer (Limited support, may require additional polyfills for older versions)

While Ladda strives for broad compatibility,  it's always recommended to test thoroughly across your target browsers to ensure optimal performance and appearance in your specific use case.  Older or unsupported browsers might exhibit some limitations.


## Core Components

### Buttons: Basic Usage

The core functionality of Ladda UI revolves around enhancing buttons.  To use Ladda on a button, you first need to select the button element in your JavaScript code. Then, create a new `Ladda` object, passing the button element as an argument.  This creates a Ladda instance associated with that button.

```javascript
// Assuming you have a button with the ID "myButton" in your HTML:
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
const laddaButton = Ladda.create(button); // Create a Ladda instance

// To start the loading animation:
laddaButton.start();

// To stop the loading animation:
laddaButton.stop();
```

This simple example demonstrates the fundamental process.  The `start()` method initiates the spinner animation, visually indicating an ongoing operation, while `stop()` terminates it.  Remember to include the Ladda library in your project as described in the installation section.



### Buttons: Styling and Customization

Ladda's default styling is clean and unobtrusive, but you can easily customize it to match your application's theme.  This is achieved primarily through CSS. Ladda uses specific CSS classes to style the button and its loading indicator.  You can override these classes in your stylesheet to modify colors, sizes, and animation characteristics.

For example, to change the spinner color to blue:

```css
.ladda-button .ladda-progress {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

Refer to the Ladda CSS documentation for a complete list of available classes and their functionalities.  You can modify aspects like spinner size, button background during loading, and more by targeting these classes.  Remember that directly modifying the Ladda source files isn't recommended; using CSS overrides is the preferred approach for customization.


### Buttons: Advanced Features (e.g., progress indicators)

Beyond simple start/stop functionality, Ladda offers more advanced capabilities.  While it doesn't inherently provide a detailed progress bar within the spinner itself, you can use the `setProgress()` method to visually represent progress during a long-running operation, although this typically impacts the visual aspect of the button/spinner rather than directly affecting the spinner animation.

```javascript
// ... (Ladda button initialization as above) ...

// Set the progress to 50%
laddaButton.setProgress(0.5);

// ... (after some work is done) ...

// Update the progress
laddaButton.setProgress(0.8);

// ... (after completion) ...

laddaButton.stop();
```

This example shows how you can update the progress visually, offering the user more feedback during long tasks. Note that the exact visual manifestation of `setProgress()` might depend on your CSS styling.  Refer to the Ladda documentation for more nuanced control over the progress indicator (if you are using a custom progress indicator in conjunction with Ladda).


### Other Components (if any)

Currently, Ladda UI primarily focuses on enhancing buttons.  It doesn't directly provide other components like loading overlays or spinners for elements beyond buttons.  However, the core loading animation could, in principle, be adapted and applied to other UI elements with appropriate CSS adjustments and careful JavaScript integration if needed.  This would involve applying the Ladda styles and potentially creating a custom wrapper element to mimic the button functionality within your desired component.  The flexibility to apply Ladda's spinner logic to custom elements is present, but it requires more custom coding compared to using it with standard buttons.


## Advanced Usage

### Styling with CSS

Ladda's visual appearance is highly customizable through CSS.  As mentioned before,  Ladda uses a set of CSS classes to style the button and its spinner.  By targeting these classes in your stylesheet, you can achieve a wide range of visual effects.

For instance, to change the spinner color, you would modify the `.ladda-progress` class:

```css
.ladda-button .ladda-progress {
  background-color: #FF0000; /* Red spinner */
}
```

Similarly, you can adjust the button's background color during loading using `.ladda-button:hover`, `.ladda-button.ladda-loading`, and related classes.  You can also modify the size and positioning of the spinner, its animation speed, and other visual aspects by overriding the existing Ladda styles.  Consult the Ladda CSS documentation for a complete list of classes and their properties to explore the full range of styling possibilities.


### Customizing Progress Indicators

While Ladda provides a default spinner, you can customize its visual appearance significantly through CSS, as described above.  However,  Ladda doesn't offer a direct mechanism to replace the default spinner with a completely different indicator (like a progress bar).  Any significant changes to the indicator type require significant custom development, going beyond simple CSS adjustments.  You would need to create a custom HTML element for the new indicator, handle the animation yourself (potentially using JavaScript animation libraries), and manage its synchronization with the Ladda button's `start()` and `stop()` methods.  This would necessitate a deeper understanding of how Ladda manages its button states and loading animation.


### Integrating with Other JavaScript Frameworks

Ladda is designed to be framework-agnostic.  It can be seamlessly integrated into various JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.  The integration process generally involves creating a wrapper component (in the chosen framework) that encapsulates the Ladda button initialization and management logic.  The actual Ladda API calls (`Ladda.create`, `start`, `stop`, `setProgress`) remain the same.  However, the method of integrating the Ladda instance into the framework's component lifecycle and data-binding mechanism will vary depending on the framework used.  Framework-specific examples and best practices may be available in the Ladda documentation or community resources.


### Handling Events

Ladda itself doesn't directly expose events.  The initiation and termination of the loading animation are controlled through the `start()` and `stop()` methods.   If you need to perform actions before or after the loading animation, you should handle those events directly within your application logic, triggered by events related to the asynchronous operation being performed, not by events provided by Ladda itself. For example:

```javascript
laddaButton.start();
myAsynchronousFunction()
  .then(() => {
    laddaButton.stop();
    // Perform actions after the operation is complete
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    laddaButton.stop();
    // Handle errors
  });

```

This uses Promises to handle the completion or failure of the asynchronous operation.  The `laddaButton.stop()` call is placed within the `then()` and `catch()` blocks to ensure the loading animation stops irrespective of success or failure.


### Troubleshooting

* **Spinner not appearing:** Double-check that you've correctly included the Ladda library in your project and that the CSS is properly applied. Inspect the button element in your browser's developer tools to ensure the Ladda classes are added and the CSS styles are applied.
* **Spinner not stopping:** Ensure that `laddaButton.stop()` is called when the asynchronous operation completes, even in case of errors.  Inspect your code for any potential issues preventing the `stop()` method from being executed.
* **Styling issues:** If the spinner doesn't look as expected, carefully review your CSS overrides.  Ensure that your custom styles are properly targeting the relevant Ladda classes and that they don't conflict with the default styles.  Using your browser's developer tools to inspect the element's styles can help identify conflicts or misapplied styles.
* **Framework integration problems:** If facing issues with integration into a specific framework, consult the documentation for that framework and search for community resources addressing Ladda integration.




## API Reference

### Ladda Constructor Options

The `Ladda.create(element, options)` method creates a new Ladda instance.  The `element` argument is required and should be a DOM element (typically a button).  The `options` argument is an optional object that allows you to configure the Ladda instance. Currently, there are no publicly documented options for the Ladda constructor.  While some internal options may exist within the Ladda code, they are not part of the officially supported API and should not be relied upon, as they might change without notice.  Configuration is primarily handled through CSS as described in previous sections.


### Methods: `start()`

Starts the loading animation on the associated button.  This replaces the button's default appearance with the spinning progress indicator.

```javascript
laddaButton.start();
```

This method doesn't return any value.


### Methods: `stop()`

Stops the loading animation and restores the button to its original appearance.

```javascript
laddaButton.stop();
```

This method doesn't return any value.


### Methods: `toggle()`

Toggles the loading animation. If the animation is currently running, it stops; otherwise, it starts.

```javascript
laddaButton.toggle();
```

This method doesn't return any value.


### Methods: `setProgress(progress)`

Sets the progress of the loading animation.  The `progress` argument is a number between 0 and 1, representing the percentage of completion (0 for 0%, 1 for 100%).  The visual representation of this progress is typically subtle and depends heavily on your CSS styling. Note that Ladda's default spinner doesn't inherently display a detailed progress bar; the visual update might simply affect the spinner's appearance or a progress bar implemented separately.

```javascript
laddaButton.setProgress(0.5); // Sets progress to 50%
```

This method doesn't return any value.


### Events

Ladda itself does *not* trigger any custom JavaScript events.  The loading state is managed through the `start()`, `stop()`, and `toggle()` methods. Any actions related to the start or completion of an asynchronous operation that's indicated by Ladda should be triggered by events associated with that operation itself (e.g., promise resolution, event listeners on the asynchronous operation's completion),  not through events originating from Ladda directly.  You handle the start and end of the loading visual indication by managing calls to `start()` and `stop()` within the context of your application's asynchronous tasks.


## Examples and Best Practices

### Common Use Cases

Ladda UI is ideally suited for scenarios where asynchronous operations are initiated via buttons.  Some common use cases include:

* **Form Submissions:** Display a loading indicator while a form is being submitted to the server.  This prevents users from accidentally submitting the form multiple times.
* **API Calls:** Show a spinner while waiting for a response from an external API.
* **File Uploads:** Provide visual feedback during file uploads, indicating progress (though precise progress indication would require supplementing Ladda with a more detailed progress bar).
* **Long-running Operations:**  Indicate that a process is underway, even if the exact duration is unknown, providing reassurance to the user that the system is responding.
* **Button Disabling:** While Ladda doesn't explicitly disable the button, the visual feedback from the spinner effectively communicates that the button is currently unavailable for interaction. This prevents accidental clicks and double submissions.

In all these cases, Ladda enhances the user experience by providing immediate and clear visual feedback, making the interaction smoother and more predictable.


### Example Implementations

**Basic Example (using jQuery):**

```html
<button id="myButton">Submit</button>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="ladda.min.js"></script>
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    let ladda = Ladda.create(document.getElementById('myButton'));
    $('#myButton').click(function() {
      ladda.start();
      $.ajax({
        url: '/submit',
        type: 'POST',
        // ... your ajax settings ...
        success: function() {
          ladda.stop();
          // ... success handling ...
        },
        error: function() {
          ladda.stop();
          // ... error handling ...
        }
      });
    });
  });
</script>
```

**More complex example (using fetch and Promises):**

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
const laddaButton = Ladda.create(button);

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  laddaButton.start();
  fetch('/api/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      laddaButton.stop();
      // Process the data
      console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      laddaButton.stop();
      console.error('Error:', error);
    });
});

```

Remember to replace `/submit` and `/api/data` with your actual URLs. These examples illustrate how to integrate Ladda with different asynchronous patterns (jQuery AJAX and fetch).


### Performance Considerations

Ladda is designed to be lightweight and efficient.  It adds minimal overhead to your application.  However, overuse of Ladda on many buttons could potentially contribute to minor performance impacts, especially on older or less powerful devices.  Use Ladda judiciously, applying it only to buttons initiating significant asynchronous operations where user feedback is crucial.  Avoid using Ladda for trivial or very fast operations, as the overhead of starting and stopping the animation might outweigh its benefit.


### Accessibility Guidelines

* **ARIA Attributes:**  While Ladda doesn't directly manage ARIA attributes, it's crucial to use them correctly with your buttons to ensure proper accessibility.  When the loading animation starts, consider adding `aria-busy="true"` to the button to inform assistive technologies that the button is temporarily unavailable.  Remove this attribute when the loading is complete.
* **Visual Alternatives:**  Ensure that your styling provides clear visual cues even for users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers.   The spinner should have sufficient contrast and be distinct from the surrounding elements.
* **Alternative Text:**  Provide descriptive alternative text for buttons, especially if the button text changes during the loading process.  This helps screen reader users understand the button's state.

Following these guidelines ensures that your application remains usable and accessible for everyone. Remember that Ladda primarily provides visual feedback; you are responsible for managing the overall accessibility of your application.
