It's inspired by Flux, but offers a more concise and less opinionated approach.  At its core, RefluxJS simplifies the interaction between data sources (like network requests or user input) and the components that display that data. It achieves this primarily through the use of *stores* that manage application state and *actions* that trigger state changes.  Unlike more structured frameworks, RefluxJS has a looser coupling between stores and components, offering developers more flexibility.\n\n\n### Why use RefluxJS?\n\nRefluxJS is chosen for its simplicity and ease of use.  Developers often appreciate:\n\n* **Simplicity and Ease of Learning:** RefluxJS has a smaller API surface area compared to other frameworks like Redux, making it quicker to learn and integrate into a project.\n* **Flexibility:**  It provides less strict structure, allowing developers to adapt it to their specific application needs and preferences.  This can be beneficial for smaller projects or situations where a more rigid architecture feels overly prescriptive.\n* **Lightweight:** RefluxJS is a very small library, resulting in a smaller bundle size compared to more feature-rich alternatives.\n\n\n### RefluxJS vs. other frameworks (Flux, Redux)\n\n| Feature          | RefluxJS                     | Flux                         | Redux                        |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Structure**    | Less strict, more flexible   | Abstract, requires implementation| Strict, highly structured     |\n| **Complexity**   | Simpler, easier to learn      | More complex                  | More complex, steeper learning curve |\n| **Boilerplate**  | Less boilerplate code        | Moderate boilerplate          | More boilerplate              |\n| **Community**    | Smaller community             | Large community (though largely superseded) | Very large community          |\n| **Debugging**    | Easier debugging             | Can be more challenging     | Can be more challenging, requires specialized tools |\n\n\nRefluxJS trades some of the structure and tooling provided by Redux for greater simplicity and flexibility.  It's a good choice when a lightweight and straightforward approach is preferred, particularly for smaller applications or when learning the Flux principles. Redux, on the other hand, is better suited for larger, complex applications that benefit from its stricter structure and extensive ecosystem of tools. Flux serves mostly as a conceptual architecture and is rarely used directly in production.\n\n### Setting up a RefluxJS project.\n\nSetting up a RefluxJS project is straightforward.  You'll typically use a package manager like npm or yarn:\n\n1. **Install RefluxJS:**\n   ```bash\n   npm install refluxjs --save\n   # or\n   yarn add refluxjs\n   ```\n\n2. **Import and use in your code:**\n   ```javascript\n   import Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\n   // ... your RefluxJS code using Actions and Stores ...\n   ```\n\nThat's it!  You can then start creating Actions and Stores to manage your application's data flow.  Remember to consult the RefluxJS documentation for detailed examples and API reference.  Note that RefluxJS is not actively maintained and newer projects are generally advised to choose more actively maintained alternatives.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Stores\n\nStores are the heart of RefluxJS, responsible for holding and managing the application's data. They're essentially event emitters that listen for actions and update their state accordingly.  A store typically contains:\n\n* **State:**  The data the store manages.  This can be anything from simple values to complex objects.\n* **Listeners:**  Functions that are triggered whenever the store's state changes.  These listeners are typically React components that need to re-render when the data changes.\n* **Actions:**  The methods that trigger state changes.  These are often defined separately (see below), but are ultimately called by the store to update its data.\n\nA simplified example:\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n  data: 0,\n  init() {\n    this.listenTo(MyActions.increment, this.onIncrement);\n  },\n  onIncrement() {\n    this.data++;\n    this.trigger(this.data); // Notify listeners of the change\n  }\n});\n\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\n\n### Actions\n\nActions are essentially functions that trigger state changes within stores.  They act as the intermediary between user interactions (e.g., button clicks) and the stores that manage the data.   They serve to centralize and organize the events that lead to state updates, making the data flow easier to understand and maintain.  Actions are usually defined as simple functions that emit data to the listening stores:\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyActions = Reflux.createActions(['increment']);\n\nexport default MyActions;\n```\n\nThis creates an `increment` action that can be called from anywhere in the application to signal an increment operation.\n\n### Components\n\nComponents, usually React components, are the user interface elements that display data from stores. They subscribe to store changes via `listenTo` and re-render whenever the store triggers a change.  A simplified React component using a Reflux store might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { counter: 0 };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(counter => this.setState({ counter }));\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div>Counter: {this.state.counter}</div>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n### Lifecycle methods\n\nWhile RefluxJS itself doesn't define explicit lifecycle methods, the lifecycle methods of the components (like `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`) are crucial for managing subscriptions to stores.   `componentDidMount` is used to subscribe to store changes using `listenTo` or `listen`, while `componentWillUnmount` is essential for unsubscribing using the returned unsubscribe function to prevent memory leaks.\n\n\n### Data flow\n\nThe data flow in RefluxJS is unidirectional, similar to Flux:\n\n1. **User Interaction:** A user interacts with a component (e.g., clicks a button).\n2. **Action Triggered:** The component dispatches an action (e.g., `MyActions.increment()`).\n3. **Store Listens:** The store listens for this action and updates its internal state accordingly.\n4. **Store Triggers:** The store uses `this.trigger()` to notify its listeners that the data has changed.\n5. **Component Updates:**  The component that's listening to the store receives the updated data and re-renders, reflecting the new state in the UI.\n\nThis cycle ensures that data changes are predictable and traceable, simplifying debugging and maintenance.\n\n\n## Creating Stores\n\n### Defining a store\n\nA Reflux store is defined using `Reflux.createStore()`.  This function takes an object as an argument, which defines the store's behavior.  The object typically includes an `init()` method for initialization and methods to handle actions.  A basic store might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n  init() {\n    this.data = 0;\n  },\n  // ... methods to handle actions ...\n});\n\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\nThe `init()` method is called when the store is created.  It's a good place to initialize the store's state.\n\n\n### Handling actions\n\nStores handle actions using the `listenTo()` method. This method takes an action and a callback function as arguments.  The callback function is executed whenever the specified action is triggered.  Multiple actions can be listened for.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\nimport MyActions from './MyActions'; // Assuming MyActions is defined elsewhere\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n  init() {\n    this.data = 0;\n    this.listenTo(MyActions.increment, this.onIncrement);\n    this.listenTo(MyActions.decrement, this.onDecrement);\n  },\n  onIncrement() {\n    this.data++;\n    this.trigger(this.data);\n  },\n  onDecrement() {\n    this.data--;\n    this.trigger(this.data);\n  }\n});\n\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\nThe `onIncrement` and `onDecrement` functions are callbacks that handle the respective actions.\n\n\n### Triggering changes\n\nChanges to the store's state are signaled to listeners using the `trigger()` method.  This method takes the new state as an argument.  Listeners are automatically notified and re-render accordingly.  It's crucial to call `trigger()` after any state modification to update the UI.\n\n```javascript\nthis.data++;\nthis.trigger(this.data); // Notify listeners of the change\n```\n\n\n### Listening for changes\n\nComponents listen for changes in the store's state using the `listen()` method. This method takes a callback function as an argument. This function will be called every time the store's state changes.  It's important to unsubscribe from the listener in `componentWillUnmount` to prevent memory leaks.\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(data => this.setState({ data }));\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  // ... rest of component ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `listen()` method returns an unsubscribe function; this function should be called in `componentWillUnmount`.\n\n\n### Managing state\n\nThe store's state is managed within the store itself. It is recommended to keep the state as simple and predictable as possible for maintainability and debugging.  Use immutable update patterns to help with performance and debugging.\n\n```javascript\n// Instead of:\n// this.data = this.data + 1;\n\n// Use:\nthis.data = this.data + 1; //While technically mutable, the approach is still simple for this example.  For larger states, use immutability libraries.\nthis.trigger(this.data);\n```\n\n\n### Asynchronous operations\n\nAsynchronous operations (like AJAX requests) should be handled within the actions or within helper functions called by the actions, not directly within the store.  The store should only update its state in response to completed asynchronous operations. This helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and improves predictability.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\nimport MyActions from './MyActions';\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n    init(){\n        this.listenTo(MyActions.fetchData, this.onFetchData);\n    },\n    onFetchData(){\n        fetch('/api/data')\n            .then(response => response.json())\n            .then(data => {\n                this.data = data;\n                this.trigger(this.data);\n            })\n            .catch(error => {\n                //handle errors\n                this.trigger(null, error); //Trigger error to listeners\n            })\n    }\n});\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\n### Error handling\n\nError handling should be implemented within the actions and/or any helper functions that perform asynchronous operations.  If an error occurs, the store can trigger an error state to inform components, allowing for appropriate error display or retry mechanisms.  The example above shows how to pass an error alongside the data using `this.trigger(null, error)`.  Components listening should check for `null` data and handle the error accordingly.\n\n\n## Working with Actions\n\n### Creating actions\n\nActions are created using `Reflux.createActions()`.  This function takes an array of action names as an argument, and returns an object with methods for each action.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyActions = Reflux.createActions(['increment', 'decrement', 'fetchData']);\n\nexport default MyActions;\n```\n\nThis creates an object `MyActions` with three methods: `MyActions.increment()`, `MyActions.decrement()`, and `MyActions.fetchData()`.  These methods can then be called to dispatch actions.\n\n\n### Dispatching actions\n\nActions are dispatched by simply calling the action method. When called, the action emits an event that stores listening for it can react to.\n\n```javascript\nMyActions.increment();\nMyActions.decrement();\nMyActions.fetchData();\n```\n\n\n### Action creators\n\nFor more complex actions, especially those involving asynchronous operations or data transformation, it's beneficial to use action creators. Action creators are functions that return actions.  They encapsulate the logic for preparing the data before dispatching the action.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyActions = Reflux.createActions(['dataReceived']);\n\nconst fetchData = () => {\n    return fetch('/api/data')\n        .then(response => response.json())\n        .then(data => MyActions.dataReceived(data))\n        .catch(error => {\n            //handle error appropriately, may trigger a separate error action\n            console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n            //Optionally trigger an error action here\n        });\n};\n\n\nexport default {MyActions, fetchData}; //Export both the actions and the action creator\n```\n\nIn this example, `fetchData` fetches data and then dispatches the `dataReceived` action with the fetched data. Error handling is shown within the action creator to manage potential problems before passing data to the store.\n\n### Action payloads\n\nActions can carry data, known as payloads, with them.  This allows for passing information to the stores.  Payloads are passed as arguments to the action method.\n\n```javascript\n//Simple payload\nMyActions.increment(5); //Increments by 5 instead of 1\n\n// More complex payload\nMyActions.dataReceived({items: [1,2,3], timestamp: Date.now()}); \n```\n\nThe stores can then access this data within their action handlers (e.g., `onIncrement(amount)` or `onDataReceived(data)`).  This makes actions more versatile and expressive.\n\n\n## Integrating with Components\n\n### Connecting stores to components\n\nRefluxJS doesn't enforce a specific way to connect stores and components; it's generally done within the component itself. The component subscribes to the store's changes and updates its state based on those changes.  This flexibility is a key feature of RefluxJS.\n\n\n### Listening for store changes in components\n\nComponents listen for changes in a store using the store's `listen()` method within the component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.  This method takes a callback function as an argument which is executed whenever the store triggers a change.  Crucially,  `componentWillUnmount` must include a call to the returned unsubscribe function to avoid memory leaks.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { data: null };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(data => this.setState({ data }));\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {this.state.data ? <p>Data: {this.state.data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n\n```\n\nThe `listen()` method returns an unsubscribe function which is stored in `this.unsubscribe` and called in `componentWillUnmount`.\n\n\n### Updating components based on store changes\n\nThe callback function passed to `listen()` updates the component's state based on the new data from the store.  React's efficient rendering mechanism ensures that the component re-renders only when the state changes.  Using functional components with React Hooks offers a slightly cleaner syntax:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(setData);\n    return () => unsubscribe();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {data ? <p>Data: {data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n\n### Best practices for component design\n\n* **Keep components focused:** Each component should have a clear responsibility and manage a small, well-defined part of the UI.\n* **Data fetching in actions:**  Avoid directly fetching data within components.  Use actions to handle data fetching and pass the results to the stores.\n* **Efficient state updates:** Use immutable update patterns (e.g., using spread syntax or libraries like Immer) to prevent unexpected behavior and improve performance.\n* **Clear separation of concerns:** Separate the logic for updating state (handled by the store) from the logic for rendering the UI (handled by the component).\n* **Error handling:** Implement proper error handling within both actions and components to gracefully handle potential issues.\n* **Use functional components with Hooks (if possible):** Functional components with `useEffect` provide a cleaner and often more readable way to manage subscriptions and state updates than class components.\n\n\n\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### Mixins\n\nRefluxJS itself doesn't directly support mixins in the same way some other frameworks do.  The concept of a mixin—adding reusable functionality to components—is typically achieved through composition and custom higher-order components (HOCs) in React applications using Reflux.  Instead of relying on a built-in mixin mechanism, you'd create reusable functions or components that provide the desired functionality.  This approach provides better encapsulation and avoids potential conflicts compared to traditional mixins.\n\n\n### Higher-order components (HOCs)\n\nHigher-order components are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new enhanced component.  They're extremely useful for abstracting away common logic, such as connecting to stores.  An example of an HOC that connects a component to a Reflux store:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst withStore = (store) => (WrappedComponent) => {\n  return class extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n      super(props);\n      this.state = { data: null };\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n      this.unsubscribe = store.listen(data => this.setState({ data }));\n    }\n\n    componentWillUnmount() {\n      this.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} data={this.state.data} />;\n    }\n  };\n};\n\nexport default withStore;\n```\n\nThis `withStore` HOC takes a store and a wrapped component and returns a new component that listens to the store and passes the data as a prop.\n\n\n### Testing RefluxJS applications\n\nTesting RefluxJS applications involves testing both the actions and stores independently.  For actions, you primarily test that they dispatch correctly and handle asynchronous operations as expected.  For stores, you verify that they handle actions appropriately and update their state correctly.  Common testing libraries like Jest and Enzyme can be used effectively.  Mocking actions and stores during testing is often necessary to isolate units of code and make testing more efficient.\n\n\n### Performance optimization\n\nPerformance optimization in RefluxJS applications is similar to general React performance optimization.  Strategies include:\n\n* **Efficient state updates:** Utilize immutable update patterns to minimize re-renders.\n* **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` or equivalent techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components if their props haven't changed.\n* **ShouldComponentUpdate:** (In class components) Override `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent re-rendering when the state or props haven't meaningfully changed.\n* **Data fetching optimization:** Optimize asynchronous operations to minimize loading times.\n* **Code splitting:** Break down your application into smaller chunks to improve initial load times.\n\n\n### Debugging RefluxJS applications\n\nDebugging RefluxJS applications generally involves using your browser's developer tools to inspect the application's state and track the flow of actions and data updates.  Setting breakpoints in stores and actions helps to pinpoint the source of problems.  The use of Redux DevTools (although not strictly for Reflux) can be adapted to give visual representations of data flows if needed.  Logging key events and state changes throughout the application can also assist during debugging.\n\n\n### Working with external libraries\n\nRefluxJS is designed to work well with other libraries.  Integration with React is straightforward, as demonstrated throughout this manual.  You can integrate it with other libraries such as routing libraries (React Router), data fetching libraries (axios, fetch), state management libraries (although this contradicts the purpose of using Reflux), and testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, Enzyme).  The flexibility of RefluxJS makes it adaptable to various project needs and external dependencies.  However, it's crucial to maintain a clean separation of concerns when integrating with external libraries to avoid unnecessary complexity and maintainability issues.\n\n\n## Best Practices and Patterns\n\n### Structuring your application\n\nA well-structured RefluxJS application typically follows a clear separation of concerns.  Organize your code into logical units:\n\n* **Actions:** Keep actions focused on specific events and data transformations.  Avoid complex logic within actions; delegate complex operations to helper functions.\n* **Stores:** Stores should be self-contained and responsible for managing a specific part of the application's state.  Keep stores small and focused. Avoid having a single \"giant\" store.\n* **Components:** Components should primarily focus on rendering the UI and receiving data from stores.  Minimize logic within components; delegate complex logic to stores or actions.\n* **Helpers:** Create separate helper functions for common tasks or complex operations to improve code readability and reusability.  These often support both Actions and Stores.\n\nConsider a modular design where features are organized into self-contained modules.  Each module can have its own set of actions and stores. This promotes better code organization and testability.\n\n\n### Data normalization\n\nData normalization is essential for efficient data management and improved performance.  When fetching data from external sources, aim to structure the data in a consistent and normalized way to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.  This reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and manipulated, leading to better performance and easier updates.\n\n\n### Managing application state\n\nRefluxJS emphasizes a unidirectional data flow.  To effectively manage application state:\n\n* **Keep stores focused:**  Each store should be responsible for a specific part of the application's state.  Avoid creating a single, large store that manages everything.\n* **Use immutable updates:** Use immutable update patterns (e.g., using the spread operator or libraries like Immer) to prevent unintended side effects and make debugging easier.\n* **Optimize state updates:** Only update the necessary parts of the state to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.\n* **Efficient Data handling:** Design efficient methods for handling large datasets within your stores; consider pagination, data filtering, or more advanced techniques if your application demands it.\n\n\n### Code organization and maintainability\n\nTo ensure long-term maintainability:\n\n* **Follow a consistent coding style:** Adhere to a coding style guide (e.g., Airbnb style guide) to ensure consistency and readability across your codebase.\n* **Use meaningful names:** Choose descriptive names for actions, stores, and components.\n* **Write clean and well-documented code:** Add comments to explain complex logic or unusual patterns.\n* **Use version control:** Employ a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.\n* **Write unit tests:**  Thoroughly test actions and stores to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.\n* **Refactor regularly:** Regularly review and refactor your code to eliminate redundancy, improve readability, and enhance maintainability.  Regular refactoring is a crucial aspect of building a sustainable project.\n* **Keep it simple:** Avoid unnecessary complexity.  RefluxJS is designed for simplicity; leverage its strengths and avoid over-engineering solutions.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n### Debugging tips\n\nDebugging RefluxJS applications often involves using your browser's developer tools.  Here are some helpful techniques:\n\n* **Console Logging:**  Strategically place `console.log` statements in your actions and stores to track the flow of data and identify potential issues.  Log the state of stores before and after actions are handled.\n* **Breakpoints:** Set breakpoints in your browser's developer tools to pause execution at specific points in your code.  This allows you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the state of your application at various points.\n* **Network Monitoring:** Use the Network tab of your browser's developer tools to monitor network requests and responses to identify potential problems with data fetching.\n* **React Developer Tools:** Use the React Developer Tools extension to inspect the component tree and track state updates.  This can help identify if components are re-rendering unexpectedly.\n* **RefluxJS Specific Debugging:** While RefluxJS doesn't have dedicated debugging tools, understanding the data flow—actions triggering store updates, which in turn trigger component re-renders—is key.  Careful observation of this flow during debugging will isolate the source of most issues.  Thorough logging of actions, data, and states throughout the process will be invaluable.\n\n\n\n### Common errors and solutions\n\n* **Unhandled exceptions:**  Ensure proper error handling within your actions and stores. Wrap asynchronous operations in `try...catch` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.  Log any uncaught exceptions to help identify the source of the problem.\n* **Incorrect state updates:** Verify that you're updating the store's state correctly.  Use immutable update techniques to prevent unintended side effects.  Check for any accidental direct mutations of state.\n* **Listener issues:**  Make sure components correctly subscribe to and unsubscribe from stores using `listen()` and the returned unsubscribe function in `componentWillUnmount` (or the equivalent `useEffect` cleanup function in functional components). Failing to unsubscribe can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.\n* **Asynchronous issues:**  Carefully handle asynchronous operations within actions and ensure that the store's state is updated correctly once the asynchronous operation completes.  Use promises or async/await to manage asynchronous flows effectively.\n* **Incorrect action dispatch:** Double-check that actions are being dispatched correctly and that the correct payload data is being passed to the stores.\n\n\n### Performance issues and solutions\n\n* **Excessive re-renders:**  Use techniques like `React.memo` (or `shouldComponentUpdate` in class components) and immutable updates to optimize rendering performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.  Profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks.\n* **Inefficient state updates:**  Avoid updating the entire state unnecessarily.  Only update the parts of the state that have actually changed.\n* **Large datasets:** Handle large datasets efficiently.  Consider techniques such as pagination, data filtering, and virtualization to improve performance when dealing with extensive data.  Ensure you are using the most efficient data structures and algorithms for your specific needs.\n* **Slow asynchronous operations:** Optimize your asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls) to reduce loading times. Consider techniques like caching and data optimization strategies.\n* **Inefficient data transformations:** If performing complex data transformations in your stores or actions, consider optimizing these processes to reduce computational overhead.  Consider using more efficient libraries or algorithms for data manipulation if necessary.  Profiling your application can help identify these areas.\n\nRemember that optimizing performance often involves a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency.  Choose optimization strategies that improve performance significantly without making your code overly complex or difficult to maintain.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Glossary of terms\n\n* **Action:** A function that triggers a state change in a store.

It's inspired by Flux, but offers a more concise and less opinionated approach.  At its core, RefluxJS simplifies the interaction between data sources (like network requests or user input) and the components that display that data. It achieves this primarily through the use of *stores* that manage application state and *actions* that trigger state changes.  Unlike more structured frameworks, RefluxJS has a looser coupling between stores and components, offering developers more flexibility.\n\n\n### Why use RefluxJS?\n\nRefluxJS is chosen for its simplicity and ease of use.  Developers often appreciate:\n\n* **Simplicity and Ease of Learning:** RefluxJS has a smaller API surface area compared to other frameworks like Redux, making it quicker to learn and integrate into a project.\n* **Flexibility:**  It provides less strict structure, allowing developers to adapt it to their specific application needs and preferences.  This can be beneficial for smaller projects or situations where a more rigid architecture feels overly prescriptive.\n* **Lightweight:** RefluxJS is a very small library, resulting in a smaller bundle size compared to more feature-rich alternatives.\n\n\n### RefluxJS vs. other frameworks (Flux, Redux)\n\n| Feature          | RefluxJS                     | Flux                         | Redux                        |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Structure**    | Less strict, more flexible   | Abstract, requires implementation| Strict, highly structured     |\n| **Complexity**   | Simpler, easier to learn      | More complex                  | More complex, steeper learning curve |\n| **Boilerplate**  | Less boilerplate code        | Moderate boilerplate          | More boilerplate              |\n| **Community**    | Smaller community             | Large community (though largely superseded) | Very large community          |\n| **Debugging**    | Easier debugging             | Can be more challenging     | Can be more challenging, requires specialized tools |\n\n\nRefluxJS trades some of the structure and tooling provided by Redux for greater simplicity and flexibility.  It's a good choice when a lightweight and straightforward approach is preferred, particularly for smaller applications or when learning the Flux principles. Redux, on the other hand, is better suited for larger, complex applications that benefit from its stricter structure and extensive ecosystem of tools. Flux serves mostly as a conceptual architecture and is rarely used directly in production.\n\n### Setting up a RefluxJS project.\n\nSetting up a RefluxJS project is straightforward.  You'll typically use a package manager like npm or yarn:\n\n1. **Install RefluxJS:**\n   ```bash\n   npm install refluxjs --save\n   # or\n   yarn add refluxjs\n   ```\n\n2. **Import and use in your code:**\n   ```javascript\n   import Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\n   // ... your RefluxJS code using Actions and Stores ...\n   ```\n\nThat's it!  You can then start creating Actions and Stores to manage your application's data flow.  Remember to consult the RefluxJS documentation for detailed examples and API reference.  Note that RefluxJS is not actively maintained and newer projects are generally advised to choose more actively maintained alternatives.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Stores\n\nStores are the heart of RefluxJS, responsible for holding and managing the application's data. They're essentially event emitters that listen for actions and update their state accordingly.  A store typically contains:\n\n* **State:**  The data the store manages.  This can be anything from simple values to complex objects.\n* **Listeners:**  Functions that are triggered whenever the store's state changes.  These listeners are typically React components that need to re-render when the data changes.\n* **Actions:**  The methods that trigger state changes.  These are often defined separately (see below), but are ultimately called by the store to update its data.\n\nA simplified example:\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n  data: 0,\n  init() {\n    this.listenTo(MyActions.increment, this.onIncrement);\n  },\n  onIncrement() {\n    this.data++;\n    this.trigger(this.data); // Notify listeners of the change\n  }\n});\n\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\n\n### Actions\n\nActions are essentially functions that trigger state changes within stores.  They act as the intermediary between user interactions (e.g., button clicks) and the stores that manage the data.   They serve to centralize and organize the events that lead to state updates, making the data flow easier to understand and maintain.  Actions are usually defined as simple functions that emit data to the listening stores:\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyActions = Reflux.createActions(['increment']);\n\nexport default MyActions;\n```\n\nThis creates an `increment` action that can be called from anywhere in the application to signal an increment operation.\n\n### Components\n\nComponents, usually React components, are the user interface elements that display data from stores. They subscribe to store changes via `listenTo` and re-render whenever the store triggers a change.  A simplified React component using a Reflux store might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { counter: 0 };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(counter => this.setState({ counter }));\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div>Counter: {this.state.counter}</div>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n### Lifecycle methods\n\nWhile RefluxJS itself doesn't define explicit lifecycle methods, the lifecycle methods of the components (like `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`) are crucial for managing subscriptions to stores.   `componentDidMount` is used to subscribe to store changes using `listenTo` or `listen`, while `componentWillUnmount` is essential for unsubscribing using the returned unsubscribe function to prevent memory leaks.\n\n\n### Data flow\n\nThe data flow in RefluxJS is unidirectional, similar to Flux:\n\n1. **User Interaction:** A user interacts with a component (e.g., clicks a button).\n2. **Action Triggered:** The component dispatches an action (e.g., `MyActions.increment()`).\n3. **Store Listens:** The store listens for this action and updates its internal state accordingly.\n4. **Store Triggers:** The store uses `this.trigger()` to notify its listeners that the data has changed.\n5. **Component Updates:**  The component that's listening to the store receives the updated data and re-renders, reflecting the new state in the UI.\n\nThis cycle ensures that data changes are predictable and traceable, simplifying debugging and maintenance.\n\n\n## Creating Stores\n\n### Defining a store\n\nA Reflux store is defined using `Reflux.createStore()`.  This function takes an object as an argument, which defines the store's behavior.  The object typically includes an `init()` method for initialization and methods to handle actions.  A basic store might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n  init() {\n    this.data = 0;\n  },\n  // ... methods to handle actions ...\n});\n\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\nThe `init()` method is called when the store is created.  It's a good place to initialize the store's state.\n\n\n### Handling actions\n\nStores handle actions using the `listenTo()` method. This method takes an action and a callback function as arguments.  The callback function is executed whenever the specified action is triggered.  Multiple actions can be listened for.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\nimport MyActions from './MyActions'; // Assuming MyActions is defined elsewhere\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n  init() {\n    this.data = 0;\n    this.listenTo(MyActions.increment, this.onIncrement);\n    this.listenTo(MyActions.decrement, this.onDecrement);\n  },\n  onIncrement() {\n    this.data++;\n    this.trigger(this.data);\n  },\n  onDecrement() {\n    this.data--;\n    this.trigger(this.data);\n  }\n});\n\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\nThe `onIncrement` and `onDecrement` functions are callbacks that handle the respective actions.\n\n\n### Triggering changes\n\nChanges to the store's state are signaled to listeners using the `trigger()` method.  This method takes the new state as an argument.  Listeners are automatically notified and re-render accordingly.  It's crucial to call `trigger()` after any state modification to update the UI.\n\n```javascript\nthis.data++;\nthis.trigger(this.data); // Notify listeners of the change\n```\n\n\n### Listening for changes\n\nComponents listen for changes in the store's state using the `listen()` method. This method takes a callback function as an argument. This function will be called every time the store's state changes.  It's important to unsubscribe from the listener in `componentWillUnmount` to prevent memory leaks.\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(data => this.setState({ data }));\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  // ... rest of component ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `listen()` method returns an unsubscribe function; this function should be called in `componentWillUnmount`.\n\n\n### Managing state\n\nThe store's state is managed within the store itself. It is recommended to keep the state as simple and predictable as possible for maintainability and debugging.  Use immutable update patterns to help with performance and debugging.\n\n```javascript\n// Instead of:\n// this.data = this.data + 1;\n\n// Use:\nthis.data = this.data + 1; //While technically mutable, the approach is still simple for this example.  For larger states, use immutability libraries.\nthis.trigger(this.data);\n```\n\n\n### Asynchronous operations\n\nAsynchronous operations (like AJAX requests) should be handled within the actions or within helper functions called by the actions, not directly within the store.  The store should only update its state in response to completed asynchronous operations. This helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and improves predictability.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\nimport MyActions from './MyActions';\n\nconst MyStore = Reflux.createStore({\n    init(){\n        this.listenTo(MyActions.fetchData, this.onFetchData);\n    },\n    onFetchData(){\n        fetch('/api/data')\n            .then(response => response.json())\n            .then(data => {\n                this.data = data;\n                this.trigger(this.data);\n            })\n            .catch(error => {\n                //handle errors\n                this.trigger(null, error); //Trigger error to listeners\n            })\n    }\n});\nexport default MyStore;\n```\n\n### Error handling\n\nError handling should be implemented within the actions and/or any helper functions that perform asynchronous operations.  If an error occurs, the store can trigger an error state to inform components, allowing for appropriate error display or retry mechanisms.  The example above shows how to pass an error alongside the data using `this.trigger(null, error)`.  Components listening should check for `null` data and handle the error accordingly.\n\n\n## Working with Actions\n\n### Creating actions\n\nActions are created using `Reflux.createActions()`.  This function takes an array of action names as an argument, and returns an object with methods for each action.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyActions = Reflux.createActions(['increment', 'decrement', 'fetchData']);\n\nexport default MyActions;\n```\n\nThis creates an object `MyActions` with three methods: `MyActions.increment()`, `MyActions.decrement()`, and `MyActions.fetchData()`.  These methods can then be called to dispatch actions.\n\n\n### Dispatching actions\n\nActions are dispatched by simply calling the action method. When called, the action emits an event that stores listening for it can react to.\n\n```javascript\nMyActions.increment();\nMyActions.decrement();\nMyActions.fetchData();\n```\n\n\n### Action creators\n\nFor more complex actions, especially those involving asynchronous operations or data transformation, it's beneficial to use action creators. Action creators are functions that return actions.  They encapsulate the logic for preparing the data before dispatching the action.\n\n```javascript\nimport Reflux from 'refluxjs';\n\nconst MyActions = Reflux.createActions(['dataReceived']);\n\nconst fetchData = () => {\n    return fetch('/api/data')\n        .then(response => response.json())\n        .then(data => MyActions.dataReceived(data))\n        .catch(error => {\n            //handle error appropriately, may trigger a separate error action\n            console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n            //Optionally trigger an error action here\n        });\n};\n\n\nexport default {MyActions, fetchData}; //Export both the actions and the action creator\n```\n\nIn this example, `fetchData` fetches data and then dispatches the `dataReceived` action with the fetched data. Error handling is shown within the action creator to manage potential problems before passing data to the store.\n\n### Action payloads\n\nActions can carry data, known as payloads, with them.  This allows for passing information to the stores.  Payloads are passed as arguments to the action method.\n\n```javascript\n//Simple payload\nMyActions.increment(5); //Increments by 5 instead of 1\n\n// More complex payload\nMyActions.dataReceived({items: [1,2,3], timestamp: Date.now()}); \n```\n\nThe stores can then access this data within their action handlers (e.g., `onIncrement(amount)` or `onDataReceived(data)`).  This makes actions more versatile and expressive.\n\n\n## Integrating with Components\n\n### Connecting stores to components\n\nRefluxJS doesn't enforce a specific way to connect stores and components; it's generally done within the component itself. The component subscribes to the store's changes and updates its state based on those changes.  This flexibility is a key feature of RefluxJS.\n\n\n### Listening for store changes in components\n\nComponents listen for changes in a store using the store's `listen()` method within the component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.  This method takes a callback function as an argument which is executed whenever the store triggers a change.  Crucially,  `componentWillUnmount` must include a call to the returned unsubscribe function to avoid memory leaks.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { data: null };\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(data => this.setState({ data }));\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {this.state.data ? <p>Data: {this.state.data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n\n```\n\nThe `listen()` method returns an unsubscribe function which is stored in `this.unsubscribe` and called in `componentWillUnmount`.\n\n\n### Updating components based on store changes\n\nThe callback function passed to `listen()` updates the component's state based on the new data from the store.  React's efficient rendering mechanism ensures that the component re-renders only when the state changes.  Using functional components with React Hooks offers a slightly cleaner syntax:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport MyStore from './MyStore';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribe = MyStore.listen(setData);\n    return () => unsubscribe();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {data ? <p>Data: {data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n\n### Best practices for component design\n\n* **Keep components focused:** Each component should have a clear responsibility and manage a small, well-defined part of the UI.\n* **Data fetching in actions:**  Avoid directly fetching data within components.  Use actions to handle data fetching and pass the results to the stores.\n* **Efficient state updates:** Use immutable update patterns (e.g., using spread syntax or libraries like Immer) to prevent unexpected behavior and improve performance.\n* **Clear separation of concerns:** Separate the logic for updating state (handled by the store) from the logic for rendering the UI (handled by the component).\n* **Error handling:** Implement proper error handling within both actions and components to gracefully handle potential issues.\n* **Use functional components with Hooks (if possible):** Functional components with `useEffect` provide a cleaner and often more readable way to manage subscriptions and state updates than class components.\n\n\n\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### Mixins\n\nRefluxJS itself doesn't directly support mixins in the same way some other frameworks do.  The concept of a mixin—adding reusable functionality to components—is typically achieved through composition and custom higher-order components (HOCs) in React applications using Reflux.  Instead of relying on a built-in mixin mechanism, you'd create reusable functions or components that provide the desired functionality.  This approach provides better encapsulation and avoids potential conflicts compared to traditional mixins.\n\n\n### Higher-order components (HOCs)\n\nHigher-order components are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new enhanced component.  They're extremely useful for abstracting away common logic, such as connecting to stores.  An example of an HOC that connects a component to a Reflux store:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst withStore = (store) => (WrappedComponent) => {\n  return class extends React.Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n      super(props);\n      this.state = { data: null };\n    }\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n      this.unsubscribe = store.listen(data => this.setState({ data }));\n    }\n\n    componentWillUnmount() {\n      this.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} data={this.state.data} />;\n    }\n  };\n};\n\nexport default withStore;\n```\n\nThis `withStore` HOC takes a store and a wrapped component and returns a new component that listens to the store and passes the data as a prop.\n\n\n### Testing RefluxJS applications\n\nTesting RefluxJS applications involves testing both the actions and stores independently.  For actions, you primarily test that they dispatch correctly and handle asynchronous operations as expected.  For stores, you verify that they handle actions appropriately and update their state correctly.  Common testing libraries like Jest and Enzyme can be used effectively.  Mocking actions and stores during testing is often necessary to isolate units of code and make testing more efficient.\n\n\n### Performance optimization\n\nPerformance optimization in RefluxJS applications is similar to general React performance optimization.  Strategies include:\n\n* **Efficient state updates:** Utilize immutable update patterns to minimize re-renders.\n* **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` or equivalent techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components if their props haven't changed.\n* **ShouldComponentUpdate:** (In class components) Override `shouldComponentUpdate` to prevent re-rendering when the state or props haven't meaningfully changed.\n* **Data fetching optimization:** Optimize asynchronous operations to minimize loading times.\n* **Code splitting:** Break down your application into smaller chunks to improve initial load times.\n\n\n### Debugging RefluxJS applications\n\nDebugging RefluxJS applications generally involves using your browser's developer tools to inspect the application's state and track the flow of actions and data updates.  Setting breakpoints in stores and actions helps to pinpoint the source of problems.  The use of Redux DevTools (although not strictly for Reflux) can be adapted to give visual representations of data flows if needed.  Logging key events and state changes throughout the application can also assist during debugging.\n\n\n### Working with external libraries\n\nRefluxJS is designed to work well with other libraries.  Integration with React is straightforward, as demonstrated throughout this manual.  You can integrate it with other libraries such as routing libraries (React Router), data fetching libraries (axios, fetch), state management libraries (although this contradicts the purpose of using Reflux), and testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, Enzyme).  The flexibility of RefluxJS makes it adaptable to various project needs and external dependencies.  However, it's crucial to maintain a clean separation of concerns when integrating with external libraries to avoid unnecessary complexity and maintainability issues.\n\n\n## Best Practices and Patterns\n\n### Structuring your application\n\nA well-structured RefluxJS application typically follows a clear separation of concerns.  Organize your code into logical units:\n\n* **Actions:** Keep actions focused on specific events and data transformations.  Avoid complex logic within actions; delegate complex operations to helper functions.\n* **Stores:** Stores should be self-contained and responsible for managing a specific part of the application's state.  Keep stores small and focused. Avoid having a single \"giant\" store.\n* **Components:** Components should primarily focus on rendering the UI and receiving data from stores.  Minimize logic within components; delegate complex logic to stores or actions.\n* **Helpers:** Create separate helper functions for common tasks or complex operations to improve code readability and reusability.  These often support both Actions and Stores.\n\nConsider a modular design where features are organized into self-contained modules.  Each module can have its own set of actions and stores. This promotes better code organization and testability.\n\n\n### Data normalization\n\nData normalization is essential for efficient data management and improved performance.  When fetching data from external sources, aim to structure the data in a consistent and normalized way to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.  This reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and manipulated, leading to better performance and easier updates.\n\n\n### Managing application state\n\nRefluxJS emphasizes a unidirectional data flow.  To effectively manage application state:\n\n* **Keep stores focused:**  Each store should be responsible for a specific part of the application's state.  Avoid creating a single, large store that manages everything.\n* **Use immutable updates:** Use immutable update patterns (e.g., using the spread operator or libraries like Immer) to prevent unintended side effects and make debugging easier.\n* **Optimize state updates:** Only update the necessary parts of the state to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.\n* **Efficient Data handling:** Design efficient methods for handling large datasets within your stores; consider pagination, data filtering, or more advanced techniques if your application demands it.\n\n\n### Code organization and maintainability\n\nTo ensure long-term maintainability:\n\n* **Follow a consistent coding style:** Adhere to a coding style guide (e.g., Airbnb style guide) to ensure consistency and readability across your codebase.\n* **Use meaningful names:** Choose descriptive names for actions, stores, and components.\n* **Write clean and well-documented code:** Add comments to explain complex logic or unusual patterns.\n* **Use version control:** Employ a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.\n* **Write unit tests:**  Thoroughly test actions and stores to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.\n* **Refactor regularly:** Regularly review and refactor your code to eliminate redundancy, improve readability, and enhance maintainability.  Regular refactoring is a crucial aspect of building a sustainable project.\n* **Keep it simple:** Avoid unnecessary complexity.  RefluxJS is designed for simplicity; leverage its strengths and avoid over-engineering solutions.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Common Issues\n\n### Debugging tips\n\nDebugging RefluxJS applications often involves using your browser's developer tools.  Here are some helpful techniques:\n\n* **Console Logging:**  Strategically place `console.log` statements in your actions and stores to track the flow of data and identify potential issues.  Log the state of stores before and after actions are handled.\n* **Breakpoints:** Set breakpoints in your browser's developer tools to pause execution at specific points in your code.  This allows you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the state of your application at various points.\n* **Network Monitoring:** Use the Network tab of your browser's developer tools to monitor network requests and responses to identify potential problems with data fetching.\n* **React Developer Tools:** Use the React Developer Tools extension to inspect the component tree and track state updates.  This can help identify if components are re-rendering unexpectedly.\n* **RefluxJS Specific Debugging:** While RefluxJS doesn't have dedicated debugging tools, understanding the data flow—actions triggering store updates, which in turn trigger component re-renders—is key.  Careful observation of this flow during debugging will isolate the source of most issues.  Thorough logging of actions, data, and states throughout the process will be invaluable.\n\n\n\n### Common errors and solutions\n\n* **Unhandled exceptions:**  Ensure proper error handling within your actions and stores. Wrap asynchronous operations in `try...catch` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.  Log any uncaught exceptions to help identify the source of the problem.\n* **Incorrect state updates:** Verify that you're updating the store's state correctly.  Use immutable update techniques to prevent unintended side effects.  Check for any accidental direct mutations of state.\n* **Listener issues:**  Make sure components correctly subscribe to and unsubscribe from stores using `listen()` and the returned unsubscribe function in `componentWillUnmount` (or the equivalent `useEffect` cleanup function in functional components). Failing to unsubscribe can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.\n* **Asynchronous issues:**  Carefully handle asynchronous operations within actions and ensure that the store's state is updated correctly once the asynchronous operation completes.  Use promises or async/await to manage asynchronous flows effectively.\n* **Incorrect action dispatch:** Double-check that actions are being dispatched correctly and that the correct payload data is being passed to the stores.\n\n\n### Performance issues and solutions\n\n* **Excessive re-renders:**  Use techniques like `React.memo` (or `shouldComponentUpdate` in class components) and immutable updates to optimize rendering performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.  Profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks.\n* **Inefficient state updates:**  Avoid updating the entire state unnecessarily.  Only update the parts of the state that have actually changed.\n* **Large datasets:** Handle large datasets efficiently.  Consider techniques such as pagination, data filtering, and virtualization to improve performance when dealing with extensive data.  Ensure you are using the most efficient data structures and algorithms for your specific needs.\n* **Slow asynchronous operations:** Optimize your asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls) to reduce loading times. Consider techniques like caching and data optimization strategies.\n* **Inefficient data transformations:** If performing complex data transformations in your stores or actions, consider optimizing these processes to reduce computational overhead.  Consider using more efficient libraries or algorithms for data manipulation if necessary.  Profiling your application can help identify these areas.\n\nRemember that optimizing performance often involves a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency.  Choose optimization strategies that improve performance significantly without making your code overly complex or difficult to maintain.\n\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Glossary of terms\n\n* **Action:** A function that triggers a state change in a store.

Redux offers a more structured approach to state management.\n* **MobX:** Consider MobX, another popular state management library that provides a more reactive approach.\n* **React Documentation:**  Familiarize yourself with React's lifecycle methods and component structure, as it is essential for using RefluxJS effectively.\n\nNote that because RefluxJS is no longer actively maintained, finding up-to-date resources might be challenging.  The information provided here is based on the last available official documentation, but alternative state management libraries might be a more robust and supported option for new projects.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
