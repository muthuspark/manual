It parses the user agent string provided by the browser to identify the device type and version information.  This allows developers to tailor their web applications or websites based on the user's device capabilities.  It avoids reliance on CSS media queries alone, offering a programmatic way to access device information.\n\n\n### Why use mobile-detect.js?\n\n* **Reliable Device Detection:**  Accurately identifies a wide range of devices and operating systems, going beyond basic device type detection.\n* **Programmatic Access:** Provides a simple API to access device information directly within your JavaScript code, allowing for dynamic content adaptation.\n* **Lightweight and Efficient:**  Minimal impact on page load time due to its small size.\n* **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Works consistently across various browsers and their respective user agent string implementations.\n* **Easy Integration:**  Simple to integrate into existing web projects.\n\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\nThe simplest way to include mobile-detect.js is via a `<script>` tag in your HTML file.  You can download the library from [Insert download link here] and place it in your project. Then, include it in your HTML like this:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"mobile-detect.js\"></script>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a package manager like npm or yarn if your project uses one:\n\n```bash\n# npm\nnpm install mobile-detect\n\n# yarn\nyarn add mobile-detect\n```\n\nAfter installation (via either method), you'll need to require or import the library depending on your module system (e.g., ES modules, CommonJS):\n\n```javascript\n// ES Modules\nimport MobileDetect from 'mobile-detect';\n\n// CommonJS\nconst MobileDetect = require('mobile-detect');\n```\n\n\n### Basic Usage Example\n\nThis example demonstrates how to create a MobileDetect object and use its methods to detect various device properties:\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(window.navigator.userAgent);\n\n// Check if it's a mobile device\nif (md.isMobile()) {\n  console.log('This is a mobile device!');\n}\n\n// Get the operating system\nconst os = md.os();\nconsole.log('Operating System:', os);\n\n// Get the device type\nconst device = md.device();\nconsole.log('Device Type:', device);\n\n// Check for specific devices or OS versions\nif (md.is('iPhone')) {\n  console.log('This is an iPhone!');\n}\n\nif (md.version('Android') >= 8) {\n  console.log('Android version 8 or higher');\n}\n\n\n// Get a comprehensive report\nconsole.log('Full device info:', md.userAgent()); // For debugging\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"mobile-detect.js\"` with the actual path to the library file if you downloaded it manually.  This basic example shows how to initialize the library and check for different device characteristics.  The complete API documentation provides a more exhaustive list of methods and their functionalities.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Detecting Mobile Devices\n\nmobile-detect.js offers several methods to detect mobile devices. The primary method is `isMobile()`, which returns `true` if the user agent indicates a mobile device and `false` otherwise.  More specific detection is possible using methods like `is('iPhone')`, `is('iPad')`, `is('Android')`, etc.  These methods check for specific device models or brands.  Remember that user agent strings can be manipulated, so this detection is based on the information provided by the browser.\n\n\n### Detecting Operating Systems\n\nThe library provides methods to identify the operating system. `os()` returns a string representing the detected operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\", \"Windows Phone\").  You can also check for specific OS versions using `version('Android')` or similar methods.  These return a version number as a string (e.g., \"8.1\", \"16\"), or `null` if the OS is not detected or the version information is unavailable.\n\n\n\n### Detecting Browsers\n\nWhile primarily focused on device detection, mobile-detect.js can also infer the browser being used through the user agent string.  However, this is a secondary feature;  more robust browser detection might require a dedicated library if that's a primary need for your project.  You can indirectly infer information about the browser by analyzing other properties (like the OS) and comparing them to common browser-OS pairings.\n\n\n### Detecting Features (e.g., Touch)\n\nmobile-detect.js doesn't directly detect features like touch input, but infers the likelihood of touch capabilities based on the detected device type.  For example, if `isMobile()` returns `true` and the device is identified as a smartphone or tablet, it's highly probable that the device supports touch input.  However, this is an indirect inference, and you should use browser feature detection (e.g., `'ontouchstart' in window`) for accurate and reliable feature detection.\n\n\n\n### Using the `mobileDetect` Object\n\nThe core of the library revolves around the `MobileDetect` object. You create an instance by passing the user agent string to the constructor:\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(window.navigator.userAgent);\n```\n\nOnce you have a `md` object, you can call its various methods to access information:\n\n* **`isMobile()`:** Boolean, true if a mobile device is detected.\n* **`isTablet()`:** Boolean, true if a tablet is detected.\n* **`is('deviceName')`:** Boolean, true if the specified device is detected (e.g., `is('iPhone')`, `is('iPad')`).\n* **`os()`:** String, the detected operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\").\n* **`version(osName)`:** String, the version of a specific OS (e.g., `version('Android')`).\n* **`device()`:** String, returns the detected device type (e.g., \"iPhone\", \"Samsung Galaxy S8\").  May return null.\n* **`userAgent()`:** String, returns the original user agent string.  Useful for debugging.\n\nEach method returns the detected information or `null` if the information is unavailable or not applicable.  Always check for `null` values before using the returned data to prevent errors in your application.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Detection Rules\n\nWhile mobile-detect.js provides a comprehensive set of default detection rules, you might need to customize them for specific scenarios.  This is not directly supported through a configuration API within the library itself. The detection logic is embedded within the library's core. To customize, you'd need to fork the library and modify its internal regular expressions and conditional logic directly; then, rebuild and use your customized version. This approach requires a good understanding of the library's source code and regular expression syntax.  Consider the maintenance implications if you choose this route.\n\n### Handling Specific Devices or OS Versions\n\nThe library provides methods to handle specific devices and OS versions.  Use `is('deviceName')` to check for specific devices (e.g., `md.is('iPhone')`), and `version('osName')` to get the version of a particular OS (e.g., `md.version('Android')`). You can combine these methods to create conditional logic for your application based on specific devices and OS versions.  For instance:\n\n```javascript\nif (md.is('iPhone') && parseFloat(md.version('iOS')) >= 15) {\n  // Code for iPhones running iOS 15 or higher\n}\n```\n\nRemember that version numbers are returned as strings; you might need to parse them using `parseFloat()` for numerical comparisons.\n\n### Integration with Frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)\n\nIntegrating mobile-detect.js with frameworks like React or Angular is straightforward.  For React, you can use it within functional components or class components:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport MobileDetect from 'mobile-detect';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const md = new MobileDetect(window.navigator.userAgent);\n    setIsMobile(md.isMobile());\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isMobile ? <p>Mobile device detected</p> : <p>Not a mobile device</p>}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFor Angular, you can inject it into a service or component similarly, depending on your application's architecture.  The core principle remains the same:  instantiate `MobileDetect` and access its methods to determine the device information within the context of your framework's lifecycle methods (e.g., `ngOnInit` in Angular, `useEffect` in React).\n\n\n### Asynchronous Detection\n\nmobile-detect.js is synchronous; it performs detection immediately when the `MobileDetect` object is created.  No asynchronous operations are involved.  If you need to perform detection within an asynchronous context (e.g., after fetching data from an API), you can simply call the detection methods within your asynchronous callback or promise.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Fallbacks\n\nThe library's methods generally return `null` if no information is available.  Always check for `null` values before using the returned data.  Consider providing fallback mechanisms in your application's logic to gracefully handle cases where device information cannot be reliably determined:\n\n```javascript\nconst os = md.os() || 'Unknown OS'; // Provides a fallback if OS detection fails\n```\n\nThis approach prevents errors and ensures your application handles unexpected situations robustly.  You may also add overall error handling using try-catch blocks if necessary, though the library itself generally doesn't throw errors.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `mobileDetect.version(osName)`\n\nThis method returns the version number of a specified operating system.  The `osName` argument is a string representing the operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\").  The method returns a string representing the version number if detected, otherwise `null`.  Note that the version number is a string and might need to be parsed (e.g., using `parseFloat()`) for numerical comparisons.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst androidVersion = md.version('Android'); // Returns a string like \"12\", \"13\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Android Version:\", androidVersion);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.phone()`\n\nReturns a string indicating the detected phone model or brand if available; otherwise, it returns `null`.  The detection relies on patterns within the user agent string and might not be perfectly accurate in all cases.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst phone = md.phone(); // Returns a string like \"iPhone\", \"Samsung Galaxy S23\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Phone:\", phone);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.tablet()`\n\nSimilar to `mobileDetect.phone()`, this method returns a string representing the detected tablet model or brand if available, and `null` otherwise.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst tablet = md.tablet(); // Returns a string like \"iPad\", \"Samsung Galaxy Tab S8\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Tablet:\", tablet);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.os()`\n\nReturns a string representing the detected operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\", \"Windows Phone\", etc.). Returns `null` if no operating system can be reliably identified.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst operatingSystem = md.os(); // Returns a string like \"Android\", \"iOS\", \"Windows\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Operating System:\", operatingSystem);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.browser()`\n\nReturns a string representing the detected browser (e.g., \"Chrome\", \"Firefox\", \"Safari\").  Keep in mind that browser detection in this library is less emphasized than OS and device detection. Returns `null` if the browser cannot be confidently identified.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst browser = md.browser(); // Returns a string like \"Chrome\", \"Firefox\", \"Safari\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Browser:\", browser);\n```\n\n\n\n### All other detection methods\n\nBeyond the methods listed above, mobile-detect.js provides a range of other detection methods, generally following the pattern `is(string)` where `string` represents the device or feature to check.  Examples include `isMobile()`, `isTablet()`, `is('iPhone')`, `is('iPad')`, `is('Android')`, and many others. These methods return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the specified device or feature is detected.  Consult the full list available in the library documentation for a complete reference.\n\n\n### Utility methods\n\nThe primary utility method is `userAgent()`, which returns the original user agent string passed to the `MobileDetect` constructor. This is helpful for debugging and understanding the source data used for device detection.  There are no other significant \"utility\" methods beyond this core functionality.\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconsole.log(\"User Agent:\", md.userAgent());\n```\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Incorrect Device Detection:**  The most common issue is inaccurate device detection. This often stems from outdated or unusual user agent strings.  Ensure you are using the latest version of mobile-detect.js. If the problem persists, examine the user agent string directly (`md.userAgent()`) to identify any unusual patterns. Consider using a dedicated user agent string parser for more advanced analysis if needed.  Keep in mind that user agent strings can be spoofed, making perfect detection impossible.\n\n* **Version Detection Errors:**  Errors related to version detection are usually caused by malformed or inconsistent version information in the user agent string. Check the user agent string for the relevant part and see if the version information is present and formatted as expected by the library.\n\n* **Missing or Null Values:** If a method returns `null`, it means that the information was not found in the user agent string. Always handle `null` returns gracefully in your code to prevent errors.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Inspect the User Agent String:** The first step in debugging is always to examine the user agent string using `md.userAgent()`. This reveals the raw data the library uses for detection. This helps pinpoint inconsistencies or missing information.\n\n* **Test with Different User Agents:** Test your code with a variety of user agent strings representing different devices and operating systems.  You can find lists of user agent strings online to simulate various devices and browsers.\n\n* **Console Logging:** Use `console.log()` statements to track the values returned by different methods.  This helps trace the flow of your code and isolate potential problems.\n\n* **Simplify Your Logic:**  Break down complex conditional logic into smaller, more manageable parts to identify the specific source of errors.\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n* **Q: Is mobile-detect.js compatible with all browsers?**  A:  It's compatible with most modern browsers. However, very old or unusual browsers might exhibit unexpected behavior.\n\n* **Q: How accurate is the device detection?** A: The accuracy depends on the quality and consistency of the user agent string provided by the browser. User agent strings can be manipulated, impacting detection accuracy. The library strives for high accuracy, but perfect detection is not always guaranteed.\n\n* **Q: Can I customize the detection rules?** A: Direct customization of the detection rules within the library is not officially supported. You would need to modify the library's source code directly.\n\n* **Q: What if the library doesn't detect my specific device?** A: If your device isn't detected, it's likely due to an unusual or uncommon user agent string. Providing feedback and the user agent string to the project maintainers can be helpful.\n\n\n### Support and Community Resources\n\nFor support, you can check the project's [GitHub repository](insert_github_link_here) for issues and discussions.

This basic example shows how to initialize the library and check for different device characteristics.  The complete API documentation provides a more exhaustive list of methods and their functionalities.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Detecting Mobile Devices\n\nmobile-detect.js offers several methods to detect mobile devices. The primary method is `isMobile()`, which returns `true` if the user agent indicates a mobile device and `false` otherwise.  More specific detection is possible using methods like `is('iPhone')`, `is('iPad')`, `is('Android')`, etc.  These methods check for specific device models or brands.  Remember that user agent strings can be manipulated, so this detection is based on the information provided by the browser.\n\n\n### Detecting Operating Systems\n\nThe library provides methods to identify the operating system. `os()` returns a string representing the detected operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\", \"Windows Phone\").  You can also check for specific OS versions using `version('Android')` or similar methods.  These return a version number as a string (e.g., \"8.1\", \"16\"), or `null` if the OS is not detected or the version information is unavailable.\n\n\n\n### Detecting Browsers\n\nWhile primarily focused on device detection, mobile-detect.js can also infer the browser being used through the user agent string.  However, this is a secondary feature;  more robust browser detection might require a dedicated library if that's a primary need for your project.  You can indirectly infer information about the browser by analyzing other properties (like the OS) and comparing them to common browser-OS pairings.\n\n\n### Detecting Features (e.g., Touch)\n\nmobile-detect.js doesn't directly detect features like touch input, but infers the likelihood of touch capabilities based on the detected device type.  For example, if `isMobile()` returns `true` and the device is identified as a smartphone or tablet, it's highly probable that the device supports touch input.  However, this is an indirect inference, and you should use browser feature detection (e.g., `'ontouchstart' in window`) for accurate and reliable feature detection.\n\n\n\n### Using the `mobileDetect` Object\n\nThe core of the library revolves around the `MobileDetect` object. You create an instance by passing the user agent string to the constructor:\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(window.navigator.userAgent);\n```\n\nOnce you have a `md` object, you can call its various methods to access information:\n\n* **`isMobile()`:** Boolean, true if a mobile device is detected.\n* **`isTablet()`:** Boolean, true if a tablet is detected.\n* **`is('deviceName')`:** Boolean, true if the specified device is detected (e.g., `is('iPhone')`, `is('iPad')`).\n* **`os()`:** String, the detected operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\").\n* **`version(osName)`:** String, the version of a specific OS (e.g., `version('Android')`).\n* **`device()`:** String, returns the detected device type (e.g., \"iPhone\", \"Samsung Galaxy S8\").  May return null.\n* **`userAgent()`:** String, returns the original user agent string.  Useful for debugging.\n\nEach method returns the detected information or `null` if the information is unavailable or not applicable.  Always check for `null` values before using the returned data to prevent errors in your application.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Detection Rules\n\nWhile mobile-detect.js provides a comprehensive set of default detection rules, you might need to customize them for specific scenarios.  This is not directly supported through a configuration API within the library itself. The detection logic is embedded within the library's core. To customize, you'd need to fork the library and modify its internal regular expressions and conditional logic directly; then, rebuild and use your customized version. This approach requires a good understanding of the library's source code and regular expression syntax.  Consider the maintenance implications if you choose this route.\n\n### Handling Specific Devices or OS Versions\n\nThe library provides methods to handle specific devices and OS versions.  Use `is('deviceName')` to check for specific devices (e.g., `md.is('iPhone')`), and `version('osName')` to get the version of a particular OS (e.g., `md.version('Android')`). You can combine these methods to create conditional logic for your application based on specific devices and OS versions.  For instance:\n\n```javascript\nif (md.is('iPhone') && parseFloat(md.version('iOS')) >= 15) {\n  // Code for iPhones running iOS 15 or higher\n}\n```\n\nRemember that version numbers are returned as strings; you might need to parse them using `parseFloat()` for numerical comparisons.\n\n### Integration with Frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)\n\nIntegrating mobile-detect.js with frameworks like React or Angular is straightforward.  For React, you can use it within functional components or class components:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport MobileDetect from 'mobile-detect';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const md = new MobileDetect(window.navigator.userAgent);\n    setIsMobile(md.isMobile());\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isMobile ? <p>Mobile device detected</p> : <p>Not a mobile device</p>}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFor Angular, you can inject it into a service or component similarly, depending on your application's architecture.  The core principle remains the same:  instantiate `MobileDetect` and access its methods to determine the device information within the context of your framework's lifecycle methods (e.g., `ngOnInit` in Angular, `useEffect` in React).\n\n\n### Asynchronous Detection\n\nmobile-detect.js is synchronous; it performs detection immediately when the `MobileDetect` object is created.  No asynchronous operations are involved.  If you need to perform detection within an asynchronous context (e.g., after fetching data from an API), you can simply call the detection methods within your asynchronous callback or promise.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Fallbacks\n\nThe library's methods generally return `null` if no information is available.  Always check for `null` values before using the returned data.  Consider providing fallback mechanisms in your application's logic to gracefully handle cases where device information cannot be reliably determined:\n\n```javascript\nconst os = md.os() || 'Unknown OS'; // Provides a fallback if OS detection fails\n```\n\nThis approach prevents errors and ensures your application handles unexpected situations robustly.  You may also add overall error handling using try-catch blocks if necessary, though the library itself generally doesn't throw errors.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `mobileDetect.version(osName)`\n\nThis method returns the version number of a specified operating system.  The `osName` argument is a string representing the operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\").  The method returns a string representing the version number if detected, otherwise `null`.  Note that the version number is a string and might need to be parsed (e.g., using `parseFloat()`) for numerical comparisons.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst androidVersion = md.version('Android'); // Returns a string like \"12\", \"13\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Android Version:\", androidVersion);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.phone()`\n\nReturns a string indicating the detected phone model or brand if available; otherwise, it returns `null`.  The detection relies on patterns within the user agent string and might not be perfectly accurate in all cases.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst phone = md.phone(); // Returns a string like \"iPhone\", \"Samsung Galaxy S23\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Phone:\", phone);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.tablet()`\n\nSimilar to `mobileDetect.phone()`, this method returns a string representing the detected tablet model or brand if available, and `null` otherwise.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst tablet = md.tablet(); // Returns a string like \"iPad\", \"Samsung Galaxy Tab S8\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Tablet:\", tablet);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.os()`\n\nReturns a string representing the detected operating system (e.g., \"Android\", \"iOS\", \"Windows Phone\", etc.). Returns `null` if no operating system can be reliably identified.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst operatingSystem = md.os(); // Returns a string like \"Android\", \"iOS\", \"Windows\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Operating System:\", operatingSystem);\n```\n\n\n### `mobileDetect.browser()`\n\nReturns a string representing the detected browser (e.g., \"Chrome\", \"Firefox\", \"Safari\").  Keep in mind that browser detection in this library is less emphasized than OS and device detection. Returns `null` if the browser cannot be confidently identified.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconst browser = md.browser(); // Returns a string like \"Chrome\", \"Firefox\", \"Safari\", null, etc.\nconsole.log(\"Browser:\", browser);\n```\n\n\n\n### All other detection methods\n\nBeyond the methods listed above, mobile-detect.js provides a range of other detection methods, generally following the pattern `is(string)` where `string` represents the device or feature to check.  Examples include `isMobile()`, `isTablet()`, `is('iPhone')`, `is('iPad')`, `is('Android')`, and many others. These methods return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the specified device or feature is detected.  Consult the full list available in the library documentation for a complete reference.\n\n\n### Utility methods\n\nThe primary utility method is `userAgent()`, which returns the original user agent string passed to the `MobileDetect` constructor. This is helpful for debugging and understanding the source data used for device detection.  There are no other significant \"utility\" methods beyond this core functionality.\n\n```javascript\nconst md = new MobileDetect(navigator.userAgent);\nconsole.log(\"User Agent:\", md.userAgent());\n```\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Incorrect Device Detection:**  The most common issue is inaccurate device detection. This often stems from outdated or unusual user agent strings.  Ensure you are using the latest version of mobile-detect.js. If the problem persists, examine the user agent string directly (`md.userAgent()`) to identify any unusual patterns. Consider using a dedicated user agent string parser for more advanced analysis if needed.  Keep in mind that user agent strings can be spoofed, making perfect detection impossible.\n\n* **Version Detection Errors:**  Errors related to version detection are usually caused by malformed or inconsistent version information in the user agent string. Check the user agent string for the relevant part and see if the version information is present and formatted as expected by the library.\n\n* **Missing or Null Values:** If a method returns `null`, it means that the information was not found in the user agent string. Always handle `null` returns gracefully in your code to prevent errors.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Inspect the User Agent String:** The first step in debugging is always to examine the user agent string using `md.userAgent()`. This reveals the raw data the library uses for detection. This helps pinpoint inconsistencies or missing information.\n\n* **Test with Different User Agents:** Test your code with a variety of user agent strings representing different devices and operating systems.  You can find lists of user agent strings online to simulate various devices and browsers.\n\n* **Console Logging:** Use `console.log()` statements to track the values returned by different methods.  This helps trace the flow of your code and isolate potential problems.\n\n* **Simplify Your Logic:**  Break down complex conditional logic into smaller, more manageable parts to identify the specific source of errors.\n\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n* **Q: Is mobile-detect.js compatible with all browsers?**  A:  It's compatible with most modern browsers. However, very old or unusual browsers might exhibit unexpected behavior.\n\n* **Q: How accurate is the device detection?** A: The accuracy depends on the quality and consistency of the user agent string provided by the browser. User agent strings can be manipulated, impacting detection accuracy. The library strives for high accuracy, but perfect detection is not always guaranteed.\n\n* **Q: Can I customize the detection rules?** A: Direct customization of the detection rules within the library is not officially supported. You would need to modify the library's source code directly.\n\n* **Q: What if the library doesn't detect my specific device?** A: If your device isn't detected, it's likely due to an unusual or uncommon user agent string. Providing feedback and the user agent string to the project maintainers can be helpful.\n\n\n### Support and Community Resources\n\nFor support, you can check the project's [GitHub repository](insert_github_link_here) for issues and discussions.
