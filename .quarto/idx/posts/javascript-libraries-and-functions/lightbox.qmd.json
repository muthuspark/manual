Start the server using the instructions provided in the `README.md` file (e.g., `npm start` or `yarn start`).  This will typically open the Lightbox in your browser.\n5. **Exploring the Codebase:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure and the different files within the repository.  The `README.md` file will contain additional details and instructions.\n\nNow you are ready to start developing with Lightbox! Proceed to the next section for a detailed explanation of the API and usage examples.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\nThe installation method for Lightbox depends on how it's distributed (e.g., npm package, CDN, direct download).  Follow the instructions below relevant to your chosen method.\n\n**Method 1: Using npm (Node Package Manager)**\n\nIf you are using npm for managing dependencies, install Lightbox via the command line:\n\n```bash\nnpm install lightbox-library-name  // Replace 'lightbox-library-name' with the actual package name.\n```\n\nThen import it into your project (example using ES6 modules):\n\n```javascript\nimport Lightbox from 'lightbox-library-name';\n```\n\n**Method 2: Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network)**\n\nIf you prefer using a CDN, include the Lightbox script in your HTML file's `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"[CDN URL for Lightbox library]\"></script>\n```\nRemember to replace `[CDN URL for Lightbox library]` with the actual URL provided by the Lightbox CDN.  You may also need to include a CSS file for styling.\n\n**Method 3: Direct Download (If applicable)**\n\nIf Lightbox is offered as a direct download, download the files and include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your project according to the instructions provided in the download package.\n\n\n### Basic Usage Example\n\nThis example demonstrates the most basic implementation of Lightbox.  Assume you've already installed Lightbox using one of the methods above.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n\n<script>\n  // Initialize Lightbox (adapt this to your specific Lightbox library's initialization)\n  lightbox.init(); // Or whatever the initialization function is called.\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code adds three images with the `data-lightbox=\"mygallery\"` attribute.  Lightbox will use this attribute to group the images together into a single gallery.  When a user clicks on an image, the Lightbox will open, displaying the selected image.\n\n**JavaScript (Further Initialization or Customization - Adapt to your library):**\n\nMany lightbox implementations offer more control via JavaScript. For example you might:\n\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Adding options during initialization\nlightbox.init({\n  loop: true, // Allows looping through images\n  zoom: true, // Enables zoom functionality\n  // ... other options\n});\n```\n\nRemember to adapt this to your specific Lightbox library's API and methods.\n\n\n### Including Lightbox in your Project\n\nAfter installing Lightbox, you need to integrate it into your project's HTML and JavaScript.  The specific method depends on the Lightbox implementation.  Generally, it involves:\n\n1. **Linking CSS:** Include the Lightbox CSS file (if provided separately) in your HTML's `<head>` section using a `<link>` tag.\n2. **Including JavaScript:** Include the Lightbox JavaScript file in your HTML's `<body>` section (usually just before the closing `</body>` tag) using a `<script>` tag.\n3. **Initializing Lightbox:**  Call the Lightbox initialization function (often named `lightbox.init()` or similar) in your JavaScript code, after the Lightbox script has loaded.  Refer to your library's documentation for specific details.\n4. **Marking Images or Media:** Add appropriate attributes to your images (or other media elements) to indicate that they should be handled by Lightbox.  Common attributes include `data-lightbox` for grouping images into galleries.\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nLightbox typically offers a range of configuration options to customize its behavior and appearance.  These options are usually passed as an object to the initialization function.  Common options might include:\n\n* `gallery`:  The ID or name of the gallery (used to group related images).\n* `imageSelector`: A CSS selector to specify which images should be included in the Lightbox.\n* `caption`: Whether or not to display captions (often requiring specific attributes on image elements).\n* `loop`:  Whether to loop through images when reaching the end/beginning of a gallery.\n* `zoom`:  Whether to enable zoom functionality.\n* `overlayClose`:  Whether closing the Lightbox is possible by clicking outside the image.\n* `keyboardNav`: Whether keyboard navigation is enabled.\n* `closeBtn`: Whether to display a close button.\n* `disableScrolling`: Whether scrolling is disabled while the Lightbox is open.\n\nRefer to the Lightbox library's documentation for a complete list of available configuration options and their usage. Remember to consult your chosen Lightbox implementation's documentation for the precise options and their syntax.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Opening and Closing the Lightbox\n\nThe method for opening and closing the Lightbox depends on your Lightbox implementation.  Generally, it's triggered by user interaction (e.g., clicking an image) and handled automatically by the library. However, some libraries might offer programmatic control.\n\n**Automatic Opening:** This is the most common approach.  By assigning the appropriate attributes (like `data-lightbox`) to your images, the Lightbox will automatically open when the user clicks on an image.\n\n**Programmatic Control (if supported by your library):**  Some advanced Lightbox implementations might allow you to open and close the Lightbox programmatically using JavaScript functions.  For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Example (adapt to your library's API):\nconst lightbox = new Lightbox(); // Initialize if not already done\n\n// Open the lightbox targeting a specific image\nlightbox.open('image-id'); // Replace 'image-id' with the ID of the image\n\n// Close the lightbox\nlightbox.close();\n```\n\nConsult your specific Lightbox library's documentation for the exact methods and parameters.\n\n\n### Image Display and Navigation\n\nLightbox handles image display automatically.  It typically enlarges the image, centers it, and adds a dark overlay to the background.  Navigation is usually achieved through:\n\n* **Clicking:** Clicking on the image closes the Lightbox. In multi-image galleries, clicking will usually advance to the next image.\n* **Arrows/Buttons:**  Most Lightboxes provide arrow buttons or similar controls to navigate through multiple images in a gallery.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Support for keyboard navigation (e.g., left and right arrow keys) is a common feature.\n\n\n### Video Support\n\nMany Lightbox implementations support video playback.  This typically involves providing video URLs or embedding `<video>` tags in your HTML.  Ensure that the video files are appropriately formatted and accessible.\n\n\nTo use video support, you will generally need to add the video element (e.g. an `<iframe>` for YouTube or Vimeo, or a `<video>` tag for local videos) to your page. The Lightbox will usually detect the video type and handle playback within the Lightbox.\n\n\n### Customizable Captions and Titles\n\nAdding captions and titles enhances the user experience. The method for adding captions depends on your Lightbox implementation.  Some common approaches:\n\n* **`alt` attribute:** Using the `alt` attribute of the `<img>` tag to provide a caption.  The Lightbox will usually display this text.\n* **`data` attributes:** Using custom `data-*` attributes (e.g., `data-caption`) to specify the caption separately.\n* **JavaScript:**  Programmatically setting the caption through the Lightbox API (if available).\n\n\nExample using a data attribute (adapt to your library):\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" data-lightbox=\"gallery1\" data-caption=\"This is my amazing image!\">\n```\n\n\n### Handling Multiple Images/Videos\n\nLightbox excels at handling multiple images and videos.  You group them together by using the same value for the `data-lightbox` attribute.  For instance:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<video src=\"video1.mp4\" controls data-lightbox=\"mygallery\"></video>\n```\n\nAll three elements are now part of the \"mygallery\" gallery, enabling seamless navigation between them within the Lightbox.\n\n\n### Responsive Design and Mobile Support\n\nModern Lightbox implementations are designed to be responsive.  They automatically adjust the size and layout of the Lightbox to fit different screen sizes and orientations.  They should seamlessly work on mobile devices, utilizing touch gestures for navigation when appropriate.  Ensure your chosen Lightbox library is responsive and tests well across different devices and browsers.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Styling the Lightbox (CSS)\n\nLightbox usually provides a default CSS stylesheet that defines its appearance.  However, you can extensively customize its styling using your own CSS.  The specific CSS classes and selectors will depend on the Lightbox implementation, but common elements include:\n\n* **Overlay:** The darkened background overlay that appears when the Lightbox is open.\n* **Container:** The main container holding the image or video.\n* **Image/Video:** The image or video element itself.\n* **Close Button:** The button used to close the Lightbox.\n* **Navigation Buttons:** Buttons for navigating through multiple images/videos.\n* **Caption Container:** The element where captions are displayed.\n\nTo customize the Lightbox's appearance, you'll typically override the default CSS rules using your own CSS file.  You may need to inspect the Lightbox's default CSS to identify the appropriate selectors for the elements you want to modify.\n\n\n**Example (Illustrative):**  This is a hypothetical example, and the actual class names will vary depending on your Lightbox library.\n\n```css\n/* Overriding default Lightbox styles */\n.lightbox-overlay {\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); /* Adjust overlay opacity */\n}\n\n.lightbox-container {\n  border: 5px solid #fff; /* Add a border to the container */\n}\n\n.lightbox-close-button {\n  color: white; /* Change close button color */\n}\n```\n\nRemember to link your custom CSS file to your HTML after the Lightbox's default CSS file to ensure your styles take precedence.\n\n\n### Customizing the UI Elements\n\nBeyond styling, some Lightbox libraries allow more advanced UI customization. This might involve:\n\n* **Adding new UI elements:**  You might add custom buttons, controls, or other elements to the Lightbox.  This usually requires extending the Lightbox's JavaScript functionality.\n* **Modifying existing elements:**  You might change the HTML structure of existing UI elements (e.g., replacing the default close button with a custom image).  This also involves modifications to the library's JavaScript and potentially CSS.\n\nThe specific methods for customizing UI elements will heavily depend on the Lightbox library's API and structure. Check the library's documentation for details on how to extend or modify the UI.\n\n\n### Adding Custom Functionality\n\nExtending Lightbox's capabilities beyond its default features can be achieved through various techniques:\n\n* **JavaScript Events:**  Lightbox libraries typically offer events that you can listen for (e.g., `lightbox.on('open')`, `lightbox.on('close')`). You can trigger custom actions in response to these events.\n* **Custom JavaScript Functions:**  You can write your own JavaScript functions that interact with the Lightbox API (if one exists), adding features like custom animations, data fetching, or external service integrations.\n* **Direct Manipulation (Advanced):**  For advanced customization, you might directly modify the Lightbox's source code (not recommended unless you're comfortable with the library's internal workings).\n\n\n### Extending Lightbox with Plugins\n\nIf your Lightbox supports plugins, this offers a structured and maintainable way to add functionality without directly modifying the core library.  A plugin typically provides a set of functions or features that integrate seamlessly with the Lightbox.  Consult the Lightbox's documentation for information about available plugins and how to install and use them.\n\n\n### Theming and Presets\n\nSome Lightbox libraries offer pre-built themes or presets that provide different visual styles.  This allows for quick customization without writing custom CSS.  The availability of themes depends on the library.  Check the library's documentation for details on applying themes or presets.  This usually involves specifying a theme name or ID as a configuration option during initialization.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Integration with JavaScript Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)\n\nIntegrating Lightbox with popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue often involves using a wrapper component or adapting the library to work within the framework's component model.\n\n**React:**  You might create a React component that wraps the Lightbox functionality, managing state and props to control the Lightbox's behavior and appearance.\n\n**Angular:**  You could create an Angular component that encapsulates the Lightbox, using Angular's data binding and change detection mechanisms to update the Lightbox based on component state.\n\n**Vue:**  A Vue component would similarly wrap the Lightbox, using Vue's reactivity system to manage data and updates.\n\nThe specific implementation details depend heavily on the Lightbox library and the framework you are using. Search for existing community-contributed wrappers or follow the framework-specific instructions provided by the Lightbox library's documentation.  If no official integration exists, you may need to create your own wrapper component.\n\n\n### Handling Events (Opening, Closing, Navigation)\n\nLightbox libraries often provide events you can listen to for programmatic control and integration with other parts of your application.  Common events might include:\n\n* `lightbox:open`: Triggered when the Lightbox opens.\n* `lightbox:close`: Triggered when the Lightbox closes.\n* `lightbox:beforeOpen`: Triggered just before the Lightbox opens.\n* `lightbox:beforeClose`: Triggered just before the Lightbox closes.\n* `lightbox:next`: Triggered when navigating to the next item.\n* `lightbox:prev`: Triggered when navigating to the previous item.\n\n\n**Example (JavaScript - adapt to your library's event system):**\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.on('lightbox:open', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox opened!');\n  // Add your custom logic here\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:close', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox closed!');\n  // Add your custom logic here\n});\n```\n\n\n### Programmatic Control of the Lightbox\n\nBeyond event handling, many Lightbox libraries allow you to directly control the Lightbox's behavior through JavaScript functions. This usually includes:\n\n* **Opening the Lightbox:**  A function to explicitly open the Lightbox, potentially targeting a specific image or item.\n* **Closing the Lightbox:** A function to close the Lightbox.\n* **Navigating:** Functions to go to the next or previous item in a gallery.\n* **Setting options:**  Functions to dynamically change Lightbox options (e.g., captions, zoom level) after initialization.\n\nConsult your specific Lightbox library's documentation for the available programmatic control functions.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nBuilding an accessible Lightbox involves focusing on keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient contrast.\n\n* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Ensure the Lightbox is fully navigable using keyboard controls (e.g., tabbing, arrow keys).\n* **Screen Reader Compatibility:**  Use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) to provide meaningful information to screen readers.\n* **Sufficient Contrast:**  Ensure sufficient color contrast between the Lightbox elements and the background to make them easily visible to users with visual impairments.\n* **Alternative Text:**  Always provide meaningful `alt` text for images.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nOptimizing Lightbox performance is crucial for a smooth user experience, especially with large images or galleries:\n\n* **Image Optimization:** Optimize your images (reduce file size without significant quality loss) before using them in the Lightbox.  Use appropriate formats (WebP for example).\n* **Lazy Loading:**  If you have many images, implement lazy loading to only load images when they are visible in the viewport.\n* **Caching:**  Leverage browser caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests for already-loaded images.\n* **Efficient JavaScript:**  Write efficient JavaScript code and avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations to minimize the impact on performance.\n* **Minification and Compression:**  Minify and compress your JavaScript and CSS files to reduce their size and improve loading times.\n\nRemember to profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks and address them accordingly.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nThis section lists common problems encountered when using Lightbox and their solutions.\n\n* **Lightbox doesn't open:**\n    * **Problem:** Clicking on an image doesn't trigger the Lightbox.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that the Lightbox library is correctly included in your HTML (both CSS and JavaScript).\n        * Check the console for JavaScript errors.\n        * Ensure that the images have the correct attributes (e.g., `data-lightbox`) assigned.\n        * Verify that the Lightbox initialization function is called correctly after the library has loaded.\n        * Check your CSS for conflicting styles that might be hiding the Lightbox.\n\n* **Images don't display correctly:**\n    * **Problem:** Images are blurry, distorted, or not displayed at the correct size.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that the image paths are correct.\n        * Check the image dimensions; very large images might require additional configuration or optimization within the Lightbox settings.\n        * Ensure that the Lightbox is configured correctly to handle different image sizes.\n\n* **Navigation issues:**\n    * **Problem:**  Arrows or keyboard navigation doesn't work correctly.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Check the Lightbox's configuration options to ensure navigation is enabled.\n        * Check for JavaScript errors related to navigation functionality.\n        * Verify that the gallery is properly grouped using the `data-lightbox` attribute.\n\n* **Conflicting JavaScript libraries:**\n    * **Problem:** Lightbox conflicts with another JavaScript library on your page.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Check for any JavaScript errors in the browser's console.\n        * Load Lightbox after other potentially conflicting libraries to reduce the likelihood of conflicts.\n        * Try using a different version of Lightbox or another library.\n\n* **Styling issues:**\n    * **Problem:** Lightbox's styling doesn't match your website's design.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Use your own CSS to override the Lightbox's default styles.  Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the Lightbox's CSS classes and create targeted styles.\n        * Be aware of CSS specificity rules; your custom styles might not be overriding Lightbox's styles if the specificity is lower.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of your page.  This is invaluable for identifying styling conflicts, JavaScript errors, and network issues.\n* **Console Logging:**  Add `console.log()` statements to your JavaScript code to track the values of variables and the execution flow.\n* **JavaScript Debuggers:** Use your browser's debugger to step through your JavaScript code line by line, inspecting variables and identifying the source of errors.\n* **Simplify Your Code:**  If you're having trouble debugging a complex implementation, try creating a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the problem.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Reporting\n\nLightbox implementations may have built-in error handling or provide methods for adding custom error handlers.  If your Lightbox doesn't handle errors gracefully, you should implement proper error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.  This might involve catching exceptions, logging errors to the console, and providing informative messages to the user.  If you encounter errors not addressed in this manual, report them to the Lightbox project maintainers, providing detailed information about the issue, your environment (browser, operating system, Lightbox version), and relevant code snippets.\n\n\n### Compatibility Issues\n\n* **Browser Compatibility:**  Ensure that the Lightbox library you're using is compatible with the browsers you need to support. Test thoroughly across different browsers and versions.\n* **JavaScript Framework Compatibility:**  If using a JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue), make sure the Lightbox is compatible with your framework version.\n* **CSS Framework Compatibility:** If you're using a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, etc.), check for potential styling conflicts between the Lightbox and the CSS framework.  Prioritize your custom CSS or the CSS framework's styles as needed to avoid conflicts.\n\n\nRemember to always consult the official documentation for your specific Lightbox library for more detailed troubleshooting information and support.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a detailed reference for the Lightbox library's API.  The specific methods, events, and properties available will depend on the version and implementation of the Lightbox library you are using.  This is a general template; consult your library's specific documentation for the accurate details.\n\n\n### Lightbox Constructor\n\nThe Lightbox constructor (if applicable) is used to create a new Lightbox instance.  This might involve passing configuration options as arguments.\n\n**Example (Hypothetical):**\n\n```javascript\nconst lightbox = new Lightbox({\n  overlayColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.7)',\n  animationSpeed: 300,\n  // ... other options\n});\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\nThis section lists common methods available on the Lightbox object (or similar).  The exact names and parameters might vary depending on the specific Lightbox implementation.\n\n* **`open(selectorOrElement)`:** Opens the Lightbox, targeting elements matching the given selector or a specific DOM element.\n\n    * `selectorOrElement`:  (string or HTMLElement) CSS selector to match elements or a direct DOM element reference.\n\n* **`close()`:** Closes the Lightbox.\n\n* **`next()`:** Navigates to the next item in the gallery.\n\n* **`previous()` or `prev()`:** Navigates to the previous item in the gallery.\n\n* **`goTo(index)`:**  Navigates to a specific item in the gallery by its index (0-based).\n\n    * `index`: (number) The index of the item to go to.\n\n\n* **`destroy()`:** Destroys the Lightbox instance, removing it from the DOM and releasing resources.\n\n* **`getOptions()`:** Returns the current configuration options.\n\n* **`setOptions(options)`:** Updates the Lightbox's configuration options.  This allows you to dynamically change settings while the Lightbox is running.\n\n    * `options`: (object) An object containing the new options.\n\n\n* **`getCurrentItem()`:** Returns the currently displayed item (image, video, etc.)\n\n* **`isLoading()`:** (Boolean) Returns true if the lightbox is currently loading an image or video\n\n\n### Events\n\nLightbox often emits custom events that you can listen for using event listeners.  The event names and details are highly dependent on the specific library.\n\n**Example Event Listener (Hypothetical, adjust to your library):**\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.on('lightbox:opened', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox opened!');\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:closed', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox closed!');\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:next', function(item) {\n  console.log('Navigated to next item:', item);\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:error', function(error) {\n  console.error('Lightbox error:', error);\n});\n```\n\n\n### Properties\n\nLightbox may expose properties allowing you to access its internal state.  These are less common than methods and events.  Access to these properties might be limited for maintainability reasons.\n\n\n**Example (Hypothetical -  availability depends heavily on library):**\n\n* `lightbox.isOpen`: (boolean)  Indicates whether the Lightbox is currently open.\n* `lightbox.currentIndex`: (number) The index of the currently displayed item.\n* `lightbox.items`: (array) An array of items in the gallery.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  This API reference provides a general structure.  The specific methods, events, and properties available will vary depending on the particular Lightbox library you are using.

Start the server using the instructions provided in the `README.md` file (e.g., `npm start` or `yarn start`).  This will typically open the Lightbox in your browser.\n5. **Exploring the Codebase:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure and the different files within the repository.  The `README.md` file will contain additional details and instructions.\n\nNow you are ready to start developing with Lightbox! Proceed to the next section for a detailed explanation of the API and usage examples.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\nThe installation method for Lightbox depends on how it's distributed (e.g., npm package, CDN, direct download).  Follow the instructions below relevant to your chosen method.\n\n**Method 1: Using npm (Node Package Manager)**\n\nIf you are using npm for managing dependencies, install Lightbox via the command line:\n\n```bash\nnpm install lightbox-library-name  // Replace 'lightbox-library-name' with the actual package name.\n```\n\nThen import it into your project (example using ES6 modules):\n\n```javascript\nimport Lightbox from 'lightbox-library-name';\n```\n\n**Method 2: Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network)**\n\nIf you prefer using a CDN, include the Lightbox script in your HTML file's `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"[CDN URL for Lightbox library]\"></script>\n```\nRemember to replace `[CDN URL for Lightbox library]` with the actual URL provided by the Lightbox CDN.  You may also need to include a CSS file for styling.\n\n**Method 3: Direct Download (If applicable)**\n\nIf Lightbox is offered as a direct download, download the files and include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your project according to the instructions provided in the download package.\n\n\n### Basic Usage Example\n\nThis example demonstrates the most basic implementation of Lightbox.  Assume you've already installed Lightbox using one of the methods above.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n\n<script>\n  // Initialize Lightbox (adapt this to your specific Lightbox library's initialization)\n  lightbox.init(); // Or whatever the initialization function is called.\n</script>\n```\n\nThis code adds three images with the `data-lightbox=\"mygallery\"` attribute.  Lightbox will use this attribute to group the images together into a single gallery.  When a user clicks on an image, the Lightbox will open, displaying the selected image.\n\n**JavaScript (Further Initialization or Customization - Adapt to your library):**\n\nMany lightbox implementations offer more control via JavaScript. For example you might:\n\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Adding options during initialization\nlightbox.init({\n  loop: true, // Allows looping through images\n  zoom: true, // Enables zoom functionality\n  // ... other options\n});\n```\n\nRemember to adapt this to your specific Lightbox library's API and methods.\n\n\n### Including Lightbox in your Project\n\nAfter installing Lightbox, you need to integrate it into your project's HTML and JavaScript.  The specific method depends on the Lightbox implementation.  Generally, it involves:\n\n1. **Linking CSS:** Include the Lightbox CSS file (if provided separately) in your HTML's `<head>` section using a `<link>` tag.\n2. **Including JavaScript:** Include the Lightbox JavaScript file in your HTML's `<body>` section (usually just before the closing `</body>` tag) using a `<script>` tag.\n3. **Initializing Lightbox:**  Call the Lightbox initialization function (often named `lightbox.init()` or similar) in your JavaScript code, after the Lightbox script has loaded.  Refer to your library's documentation for specific details.\n4. **Marking Images or Media:** Add appropriate attributes to your images (or other media elements) to indicate that they should be handled by Lightbox.  Common attributes include `data-lightbox` for grouping images into galleries.\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nLightbox typically offers a range of configuration options to customize its behavior and appearance.  These options are usually passed as an object to the initialization function.  Common options might include:\n\n* `gallery`:  The ID or name of the gallery (used to group related images).\n* `imageSelector`: A CSS selector to specify which images should be included in the Lightbox.\n* `caption`: Whether or not to display captions (often requiring specific attributes on image elements).\n* `loop`:  Whether to loop through images when reaching the end/beginning of a gallery.\n* `zoom`:  Whether to enable zoom functionality.\n* `overlayClose`:  Whether closing the Lightbox is possible by clicking outside the image.\n* `keyboardNav`: Whether keyboard navigation is enabled.\n* `closeBtn`: Whether to display a close button.\n* `disableScrolling`: Whether scrolling is disabled while the Lightbox is open.\n\nRefer to the Lightbox library's documentation for a complete list of available configuration options and their usage. Remember to consult your chosen Lightbox implementation's documentation for the precise options and their syntax.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Opening and Closing the Lightbox\n\nThe method for opening and closing the Lightbox depends on your Lightbox implementation.  Generally, it's triggered by user interaction (e.g., clicking an image) and handled automatically by the library. However, some libraries might offer programmatic control.\n\n**Automatic Opening:** This is the most common approach.  By assigning the appropriate attributes (like `data-lightbox`) to your images, the Lightbox will automatically open when the user clicks on an image.\n\n**Programmatic Control (if supported by your library):**  Some advanced Lightbox implementations might allow you to open and close the Lightbox programmatically using JavaScript functions.  For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Example (adapt to your library's API):\nconst lightbox = new Lightbox(); // Initialize if not already done\n\n// Open the lightbox targeting a specific image\nlightbox.open('image-id'); // Replace 'image-id' with the ID of the image\n\n// Close the lightbox\nlightbox.close();\n```\n\nConsult your specific Lightbox library's documentation for the exact methods and parameters.\n\n\n### Image Display and Navigation\n\nLightbox handles image display automatically.  It typically enlarges the image, centers it, and adds a dark overlay to the background.  Navigation is usually achieved through:\n\n* **Clicking:** Clicking on the image closes the Lightbox. In multi-image galleries, clicking will usually advance to the next image.\n* **Arrows/Buttons:**  Most Lightboxes provide arrow buttons or similar controls to navigate through multiple images in a gallery.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Support for keyboard navigation (e.g., left and right arrow keys) is a common feature.\n\n\n### Video Support\n\nMany Lightbox implementations support video playback.  This typically involves providing video URLs or embedding `<video>` tags in your HTML.  Ensure that the video files are appropriately formatted and accessible.\n\n\nTo use video support, you will generally need to add the video element (e.g. an `<iframe>` for YouTube or Vimeo, or a `<video>` tag for local videos) to your page. The Lightbox will usually detect the video type and handle playback within the Lightbox.\n\n\n### Customizable Captions and Titles\n\nAdding captions and titles enhances the user experience. The method for adding captions depends on your Lightbox implementation.  Some common approaches:\n\n* **`alt` attribute:** Using the `alt` attribute of the `<img>` tag to provide a caption.  The Lightbox will usually display this text.\n* **`data` attributes:** Using custom `data-*` attributes (e.g., `data-caption`) to specify the caption separately.\n* **JavaScript:**  Programmatically setting the caption through the Lightbox API (if available).\n\n\nExample using a data attribute (adapt to your library):\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" data-lightbox=\"gallery1\" data-caption=\"This is my amazing image!\">\n```\n\n\n### Handling Multiple Images/Videos\n\nLightbox excels at handling multiple images and videos.  You group them together by using the same value for the `data-lightbox` attribute.  For instance:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" data-lightbox=\"mygallery\">\n<video src=\"video1.mp4\" controls data-lightbox=\"mygallery\"></video>\n```\n\nAll three elements are now part of the \"mygallery\" gallery, enabling seamless navigation between them within the Lightbox.\n\n\n### Responsive Design and Mobile Support\n\nModern Lightbox implementations are designed to be responsive.  They automatically adjust the size and layout of the Lightbox to fit different screen sizes and orientations.  They should seamlessly work on mobile devices, utilizing touch gestures for navigation when appropriate.  Ensure your chosen Lightbox library is responsive and tests well across different devices and browsers.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Styling the Lightbox (CSS)\n\nLightbox usually provides a default CSS stylesheet that defines its appearance.  However, you can extensively customize its styling using your own CSS.  The specific CSS classes and selectors will depend on the Lightbox implementation, but common elements include:\n\n* **Overlay:** The darkened background overlay that appears when the Lightbox is open.\n* **Container:** The main container holding the image or video.\n* **Image/Video:** The image or video element itself.\n* **Close Button:** The button used to close the Lightbox.\n* **Navigation Buttons:** Buttons for navigating through multiple images/videos.\n* **Caption Container:** The element where captions are displayed.\n\nTo customize the Lightbox's appearance, you'll typically override the default CSS rules using your own CSS file.  You may need to inspect the Lightbox's default CSS to identify the appropriate selectors for the elements you want to modify.\n\n\n**Example (Illustrative):**  This is a hypothetical example, and the actual class names will vary depending on your Lightbox library.\n\n```css\n/* Overriding default Lightbox styles */\n.lightbox-overlay {\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); /* Adjust overlay opacity */\n}\n\n.lightbox-container {\n  border: 5px solid #fff; /* Add a border to the container */\n}\n\n.lightbox-close-button {\n  color: white; /* Change close button color */\n}\n```\n\nRemember to link your custom CSS file to your HTML after the Lightbox's default CSS file to ensure your styles take precedence.\n\n\n### Customizing the UI Elements\n\nBeyond styling, some Lightbox libraries allow more advanced UI customization. This might involve:\n\n* **Adding new UI elements:**  You might add custom buttons, controls, or other elements to the Lightbox.  This usually requires extending the Lightbox's JavaScript functionality.\n* **Modifying existing elements:**  You might change the HTML structure of existing UI elements (e.g., replacing the default close button with a custom image).  This also involves modifications to the library's JavaScript and potentially CSS.\n\nThe specific methods for customizing UI elements will heavily depend on the Lightbox library's API and structure. Check the library's documentation for details on how to extend or modify the UI.\n\n\n### Adding Custom Functionality\n\nExtending Lightbox's capabilities beyond its default features can be achieved through various techniques:\n\n* **JavaScript Events:**  Lightbox libraries typically offer events that you can listen for (e.g., `lightbox.on('open')`, `lightbox.on('close')`). You can trigger custom actions in response to these events.\n* **Custom JavaScript Functions:**  You can write your own JavaScript functions that interact with the Lightbox API (if one exists), adding features like custom animations, data fetching, or external service integrations.\n* **Direct Manipulation (Advanced):**  For advanced customization, you might directly modify the Lightbox's source code (not recommended unless you're comfortable with the library's internal workings).\n\n\n### Extending Lightbox with Plugins\n\nIf your Lightbox supports plugins, this offers a structured and maintainable way to add functionality without directly modifying the core library.  A plugin typically provides a set of functions or features that integrate seamlessly with the Lightbox.  Consult the Lightbox's documentation for information about available plugins and how to install and use them.\n\n\n### Theming and Presets\n\nSome Lightbox libraries offer pre-built themes or presets that provide different visual styles.  This allows for quick customization without writing custom CSS.  The availability of themes depends on the library.  Check the library's documentation for details on applying themes or presets.  This usually involves specifying a theme name or ID as a configuration option during initialization.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Integration with JavaScript Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)\n\nIntegrating Lightbox with popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue often involves using a wrapper component or adapting the library to work within the framework's component model.\n\n**React:**  You might create a React component that wraps the Lightbox functionality, managing state and props to control the Lightbox's behavior and appearance.\n\n**Angular:**  You could create an Angular component that encapsulates the Lightbox, using Angular's data binding and change detection mechanisms to update the Lightbox based on component state.\n\n**Vue:**  A Vue component would similarly wrap the Lightbox, using Vue's reactivity system to manage data and updates.\n\nThe specific implementation details depend heavily on the Lightbox library and the framework you are using. Search for existing community-contributed wrappers or follow the framework-specific instructions provided by the Lightbox library's documentation.  If no official integration exists, you may need to create your own wrapper component.\n\n\n### Handling Events (Opening, Closing, Navigation)\n\nLightbox libraries often provide events you can listen to for programmatic control and integration with other parts of your application.  Common events might include:\n\n* `lightbox:open`: Triggered when the Lightbox opens.\n* `lightbox:close`: Triggered when the Lightbox closes.\n* `lightbox:beforeOpen`: Triggered just before the Lightbox opens.\n* `lightbox:beforeClose`: Triggered just before the Lightbox closes.\n* `lightbox:next`: Triggered when navigating to the next item.\n* `lightbox:prev`: Triggered when navigating to the previous item.\n\n\n**Example (JavaScript - adapt to your library's event system):**\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.on('lightbox:open', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox opened!');\n  // Add your custom logic here\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:close', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox closed!');\n  // Add your custom logic here\n});\n```\n\n\n### Programmatic Control of the Lightbox\n\nBeyond event handling, many Lightbox libraries allow you to directly control the Lightbox's behavior through JavaScript functions. This usually includes:\n\n* **Opening the Lightbox:**  A function to explicitly open the Lightbox, potentially targeting a specific image or item.\n* **Closing the Lightbox:** A function to close the Lightbox.\n* **Navigating:** Functions to go to the next or previous item in a gallery.\n* **Setting options:**  Functions to dynamically change Lightbox options (e.g., captions, zoom level) after initialization.\n\nConsult your specific Lightbox library's documentation for the available programmatic control functions.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nBuilding an accessible Lightbox involves focusing on keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient contrast.\n\n* **Keyboard Navigation:**  Ensure the Lightbox is fully navigable using keyboard controls (e.g., tabbing, arrow keys).\n* **Screen Reader Compatibility:**  Use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) to provide meaningful information to screen readers.\n* **Sufficient Contrast:**  Ensure sufficient color contrast between the Lightbox elements and the background to make them easily visible to users with visual impairments.\n* **Alternative Text:**  Always provide meaningful `alt` text for images.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nOptimizing Lightbox performance is crucial for a smooth user experience, especially with large images or galleries:\n\n* **Image Optimization:** Optimize your images (reduce file size without significant quality loss) before using them in the Lightbox.  Use appropriate formats (WebP for example).\n* **Lazy Loading:**  If you have many images, implement lazy loading to only load images when they are visible in the viewport.\n* **Caching:**  Leverage browser caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests for already-loaded images.\n* **Efficient JavaScript:**  Write efficient JavaScript code and avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations to minimize the impact on performance.\n* **Minification and Compression:**  Minify and compress your JavaScript and CSS files to reduce their size and improve loading times.\n\nRemember to profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks and address them accordingly.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nThis section lists common problems encountered when using Lightbox and their solutions.\n\n* **Lightbox doesn't open:**\n    * **Problem:** Clicking on an image doesn't trigger the Lightbox.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that the Lightbox library is correctly included in your HTML (both CSS and JavaScript).\n        * Check the console for JavaScript errors.\n        * Ensure that the images have the correct attributes (e.g., `data-lightbox`) assigned.\n        * Verify that the Lightbox initialization function is called correctly after the library has loaded.\n        * Check your CSS for conflicting styles that might be hiding the Lightbox.\n\n* **Images don't display correctly:**\n    * **Problem:** Images are blurry, distorted, or not displayed at the correct size.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Verify that the image paths are correct.\n        * Check the image dimensions; very large images might require additional configuration or optimization within the Lightbox settings.\n        * Ensure that the Lightbox is configured correctly to handle different image sizes.\n\n* **Navigation issues:**\n    * **Problem:**  Arrows or keyboard navigation doesn't work correctly.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Check the Lightbox's configuration options to ensure navigation is enabled.\n        * Check for JavaScript errors related to navigation functionality.\n        * Verify that the gallery is properly grouped using the `data-lightbox` attribute.\n\n* **Conflicting JavaScript libraries:**\n    * **Problem:** Lightbox conflicts with another JavaScript library on your page.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Check for any JavaScript errors in the browser's console.\n        * Load Lightbox after other potentially conflicting libraries to reduce the likelihood of conflicts.\n        * Try using a different version of Lightbox or another library.\n\n* **Styling issues:**\n    * **Problem:** Lightbox's styling doesn't match your website's design.\n    * **Solutions:**\n        * Use your own CSS to override the Lightbox's default styles.  Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the Lightbox's CSS classes and create targeted styles.\n        * Be aware of CSS specificity rules; your custom styles might not be overriding Lightbox's styles if the specificity is lower.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of your page.  This is invaluable for identifying styling conflicts, JavaScript errors, and network issues.\n* **Console Logging:**  Add `console.log()` statements to your JavaScript code to track the values of variables and the execution flow.\n* **JavaScript Debuggers:** Use your browser's debugger to step through your JavaScript code line by line, inspecting variables and identifying the source of errors.\n* **Simplify Your Code:**  If you're having trouble debugging a complex implementation, try creating a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the problem.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Reporting\n\nLightbox implementations may have built-in error handling or provide methods for adding custom error handlers.  If your Lightbox doesn't handle errors gracefully, you should implement proper error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.  This might involve catching exceptions, logging errors to the console, and providing informative messages to the user.  If you encounter errors not addressed in this manual, report them to the Lightbox project maintainers, providing detailed information about the issue, your environment (browser, operating system, Lightbox version), and relevant code snippets.\n\n\n### Compatibility Issues\n\n* **Browser Compatibility:**  Ensure that the Lightbox library you're using is compatible with the browsers you need to support. Test thoroughly across different browsers and versions.\n* **JavaScript Framework Compatibility:**  If using a JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue), make sure the Lightbox is compatible with your framework version.\n* **CSS Framework Compatibility:** If you're using a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, etc.), check for potential styling conflicts between the Lightbox and the CSS framework.  Prioritize your custom CSS or the CSS framework's styles as needed to avoid conflicts.\n\n\nRemember to always consult the official documentation for your specific Lightbox library for more detailed troubleshooting information and support.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a detailed reference for the Lightbox library's API.  The specific methods, events, and properties available will depend on the version and implementation of the Lightbox library you are using.  This is a general template; consult your library's specific documentation for the accurate details.\n\n\n### Lightbox Constructor\n\nThe Lightbox constructor (if applicable) is used to create a new Lightbox instance.  This might involve passing configuration options as arguments.\n\n**Example (Hypothetical):**\n\n```javascript\nconst lightbox = new Lightbox({\n  overlayColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.7)',\n  animationSpeed: 300,\n  // ... other options\n});\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\nThis section lists common methods available on the Lightbox object (or similar).  The exact names and parameters might vary depending on the specific Lightbox implementation.\n\n* **`open(selectorOrElement)`:** Opens the Lightbox, targeting elements matching the given selector or a specific DOM element.\n\n    * `selectorOrElement`:  (string or HTMLElement) CSS selector to match elements or a direct DOM element reference.\n\n* **`close()`:** Closes the Lightbox.\n\n* **`next()`:** Navigates to the next item in the gallery.\n\n* **`previous()` or `prev()`:** Navigates to the previous item in the gallery.\n\n* **`goTo(index)`:**  Navigates to a specific item in the gallery by its index (0-based).\n\n    * `index`: (number) The index of the item to go to.\n\n\n* **`destroy()`:** Destroys the Lightbox instance, removing it from the DOM and releasing resources.\n\n* **`getOptions()`:** Returns the current configuration options.\n\n* **`setOptions(options)`:** Updates the Lightbox's configuration options.  This allows you to dynamically change settings while the Lightbox is running.\n\n    * `options`: (object) An object containing the new options.\n\n\n* **`getCurrentItem()`:** Returns the currently displayed item (image, video, etc.)\n\n* **`isLoading()`:** (Boolean) Returns true if the lightbox is currently loading an image or video\n\n\n### Events\n\nLightbox often emits custom events that you can listen for using event listeners.  The event names and details are highly dependent on the specific library.\n\n**Example Event Listener (Hypothetical, adjust to your library):**\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.on('lightbox:opened', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox opened!');\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:closed', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox closed!');\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:next', function(item) {\n  console.log('Navigated to next item:', item);\n});\n\nlightbox.on('lightbox:error', function(error) {\n  console.error('Lightbox error:', error);\n});\n```\n\n\n### Properties\n\nLightbox may expose properties allowing you to access its internal state.  These are less common than methods and events.  Access to these properties might be limited for maintainability reasons.\n\n\n**Example (Hypothetical -  availability depends heavily on library):**\n\n* `lightbox.isOpen`: (boolean)  Indicates whether the Lightbox is currently open.\n* `lightbox.currentIndex`: (number) The index of the currently displayed item.\n* `lightbox.items`: (array) An array of items in the gallery.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  This API reference provides a general structure.  The specific methods, events, and properties available will vary depending on the particular Lightbox library you are using.
