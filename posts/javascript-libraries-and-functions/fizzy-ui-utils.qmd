## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Components

Fizzy UI Utils components are designed to be highly customizable.  Most components accept props that allow you to modify their behavior and appearance.  For example, you can change the color, size, and other attributes of a button by passing appropriate props.  Beyond props,  some components may allow for custom children to be rendered within them, offering a high degree of flexibility in how they are presented. Refer to the individual component documentation for specific customization options.  In cases where the provided props aren't sufficient,  consider extending the components or creating custom wrappers to achieve your desired customization.


### Theming and Styling

Fizzy UI Utils employs a CSS-in-JS approach (or a similar method depending on the framework) to manage styles.  This allows for theming and easy style overrides. You can customize the overall look and feel of the components by modifying CSS variables or using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to create custom themes.  The library might provide mechanisms (e.g., a theme provider component) to easily switch between different themes.  Documentation should detail the specific CSS variables to target and how to create and apply custom themes.


### Using with React

To use Fizzy UI Utils with React, you'll typically install the library via npm or yarn and then import and use the components in your React components as you would any other React component.  Example:

```javascript
import { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>
  );
}
```

Make sure the library's export structure is compatible with your chosen React version.


### Using with Vue

For Vue.js integration, Fizzy UI Utils might provide Vue-specific components or wrappers. This could involve using a component library like Vue CLI or a dedicated installation process.  The components would then be registered and used within your Vue templates.  Refer to the library's Vue integration instructions for specifics. Example (Illustrative):

```vue
<template>
  <Button variant="primary" @click="handleClick">Click Me</Button>
</template>

<script>
import { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils-vue'; // Vue specific package

export default {
  components: { Button },
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      // Your logic
    }
  }
};
</script>
```


### Using with Angular

Integrating with Angular might involve creating custom Angular components that wrap the Fizzy UI Utils components, or it could involve providing Angular-specific modules or components directly within the library.  The integration steps will be detailed in the documentation, but will likely involve importing and using the components within your Angular templates and components.  This might require specific configuration within your Angular project's `angular.json` file or module imports.


### Accessibility Considerations

Fizzy UI Utils prioritizes accessibility.  Components are built to adhere to WCAG guidelines where applicable.  This includes using appropriate ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.  Developers should still ensure proper usage of components and potentially apply additional accessibility enhancements depending on context and specific user needs.  The documentation will outline accessibility features and best practices for using the components accessibly.


### Internationalization and Localization

To support internationalization and localization (i18n/l10n), the library may provide mechanisms to easily translate text within components.  This might involve using a translation library (e.g., i18next) or a custom approach.  The documentation will guide you on how to integrate your preferred internationalization solution with Fizzy UI Utils to handle different languages and locales effectively.  This often involves providing localized text strings as props to components or using a context-based approach for managing translations across the application.

The full list of available form handling functions, their parameters, and return values are documented in the API reference.  These functions significantly improve the ease of implementing form validation and submission, reducing the amount of custom code required.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

This section lists common errors encountered when using Fizzy UI Utils and provides solutions.

**Error:**  `Uncaught ReferenceError: FizzyUIUtils is not defined`

**Solution:** This usually means the library hasn't been correctly imported or included in your project. Double-check your import statements (e.g., `import { Button } from 'fizzy-ui-utils';` in JavaScript or the equivalent in your framework) and ensure the `fizzy-ui-utils` package is correctly installed and accessible in your project's dependency tree.  Verify the package name is correct and the path to the library is accurate.


**Error:**  Component renders incorrectly or doesn't display at all.

**Solution:** This could have several causes:
    * **Incorrect props:** Check that you are passing the correct props to the component and that the prop types match the component's expected input. Consult the component's documentation for details on required and optional props.
    * **Conflicting CSS:**  Check for any CSS conflicts that might be overriding the component's styles. Inspect the rendered HTML and CSS using your browser's developer tools to identify conflicting styles. Use browser developer tools to inspect the component's styles and ensure they are being applied correctly. Consider using more specific CSS selectors to avoid unintended style overwrites.
    * **Incorrect usage:** Ensure you are using the component correctly according to its documentation.  Review examples and usage guidelines to ensure you are following best practices.
    * **Missing dependencies:** Check if the component has any dependencies that need to be included separately.  The component's documentation will list any external libraries it relies on.


**Error:**  Runtime errors related to specific component functionality.

**Solution:**  Examine the error message carefully.  It usually indicates the problematic line of code and the nature of the error.  Look at the component's documentation for details on potential issues related to that functionality.  Use logging statements (e.g., `console.log`) to inspect the values of variables and the state of the application at various points to determine the source of the error.



More specific error messages and their solutions will be added as they are encountered and reported.


### Debugging Tips

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to inspect the rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This helps identify style issues, incorrect DOM structure, and JavaScript errors.
* **Console Logging:** Use `console.log` statements strategically to track the values of variables, the flow of execution, and to inspect data at different points in your code.  This is crucial for identifying problems within component logic.
* **Source Maps:** When debugging, ensure that source maps are enabled. Source maps help link the compiled/minified code back to the original source code, making it easier to debug.
* **Version Control:**  Utilize version control (Git) to track changes and revert to previous working versions if necessary. This is invaluable in case of errors introduced during development.
* **Read the Documentation:** The documentation provides comprehensive information on component usage, prop types, and common issues.  Before posting an issue, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed the documentation.
