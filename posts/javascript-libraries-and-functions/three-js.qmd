### What is Three.js?

Three.js is a lightweight 3D JavaScript library that makes it easy to create and display 3D computer graphics in a web browser.  It uses WebGL under the hood, providing a higher-level, more manageable API than directly working with WebGL's low-level functions. This allows developers to focus on building their 3D scenes and interactions rather than getting bogged down in the complexities of WebGL shader programming and browser compatibility. Three.js handles much of the heavy lifting, including rendering, camera control, lighting, and material management.  It's a versatile library suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple 3D models to complex interactive games and visualizations.

### Setting up your environment

To start using Three.js, you'll need a few things:

1. **A text editor or IDE:**  Choose your preferred code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.).

2. **A web browser:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with WebGL support are essential.  Most modern browsers have this enabled by default.

3. **Three.js library:** Download the library from the official Three.js website (threejs.org) or include it in your project via a CDN (Content Delivery Network). The CDN approach is often preferred for convenience. A typical way to include it is via a `<script>` tag in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r154/three.min.js"></script> 
   ```
   Remember to replace `r154` with the latest version number if necessary. Check the Three.js website for the current stable version.

4. **A basic HTML file:** This will act as the container for your Three.js scene.


### Basic Scene Structure

A basic Three.js scene consists of several key components:

* **Scene:** This is the root object that holds all the 3D objects in your scene.  Think of it as the container for everything.

* **Camera:**  This defines the viewpoint from which the scene is rendered. Common types include PerspectiveCamera (simulating human vision) and OrthographicCamera (for top-down views).

* **Renderer:** This handles the actual rendering of the scene to the canvas element in your HTML.  The `WebGLRenderer` is the most commonly used renderer.

* **Objects (Meshes):** These are the 3D models that you'll add to your scene, such as cubes, spheres, or custom models loaded from external files (e.g., .glb, .fbx).  Objects consist of geometry (shape) and material (appearance).

* **Lights:**  These illuminate your scene, making the objects visible. Different types of lights (AmbientLight, DirectionalLight, PointLight, SpotLight) offer various lighting effects.

These components interact to create the final 3D view displayed on the screen.


### First Three.js Example

This simple example creates a red cube in a scene:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Three.js Example</title>
<style>
body { margin: 0; }
canvas { display: block; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r154/three.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Scene
  const scene = new THREE.Scene();

  // Camera
  const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );
  camera.position.z = 5;

  // Renderer
  const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
  renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
  document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

  // Cube Geometry & Material
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
  const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } ); // Red color

  // Mesh (combining geometry & material)
  const cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
  scene.add( cube );

  // Render the scene
  renderer.render( scene, camera );
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a basic scene, adds a red cube, and renders it to the browser window.  Remember to save this code as an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in your web browser to see the result.  This serves as a starting point for building more complex Three.js applications.


## Core Concepts

### Scene

The `THREE.Scene` is the root of the 3D scene graph.  It acts as a container for all objects within your 3D world: meshes, lights, cameras, and other scene elements.  Think of it as the overall environment in which your 3D elements exist.  You add objects to the scene using the `scene.add(object)` method.  The scene itself doesn't have a visual representation; it's solely a organizational structure.  All rendering occurs relative to the scene's coordinate system.


### Camera

The `THREE.Camera` defines the viewpoint from which the scene is rendered.  It determines what parts of the scene are visible and from what perspective.  Three.js offers several camera types, each with its own properties:

* **`THREE.PerspectiveCamera`:** Simulates human vision, with objects appearing smaller the farther away they are.  It takes parameters for field of view (FOV), aspect ratio, near clipping plane, and far clipping plane.

* **`THREE.OrthographicCamera`:** Creates a parallel projection, where objects appear the same size regardless of distance. Useful for top-down or technical drawings.  Parameters include width, height, near, and far clipping planes.

The camera's position and orientation are crucial for the final rendered image.  You control these via its `position`, `rotation`, and `lookAt` properties/methods.


### Renderer

The `THREE.Renderer` is responsible for rendering the scene to the canvas element in your HTML. It takes the scene and camera as input and produces the 2D image displayed on the screen.  The most commonly used renderer is `THREE.WebGLRenderer`, which leverages WebGL for hardware-accelerated rendering, offering optimal performance.  Other renderers (like `THREE.CanvasRenderer` for canvas-based rendering) exist but are less efficient.

Key properties include `setSize()` (to adjust the renderer's output size) and `render()` (to perform the actual rendering).  The renderer's `domElement` property provides access to the canvas element itself, allowing you to manipulate its position or styling within your HTML.


### Objects

In Three.js, an `Object3D` is a base class representing any object that can be added to the scene.  It serves as a parent class for many other 3D elements, including meshes, lights, and cameras.  `Object3D` provides basic properties for position, rotation, scale, and other transformations.  While you can use `Object3D` directly as a container, you typically work with its subclasses (like `Mesh`) to represent visual objects in your scene.  Its hierarchical structure allows for efficient grouping and manipulation of complex scenes.


### Meshes

A `THREE.Mesh` is the most common type of object used to represent 3D geometry.  It combines a `THREE.Geometry` (or `THREE.BufferGeometry`) defining its shape and a `THREE.Material` specifying its visual appearance (color, texture, etc.).  Meshes are the visual elements you see in your 3D scene: characters, buildings, landscapes, etc.  The mesh's geometry and material define its visual properties, while its position and transformations determine its location and orientation in the scene.


### Materials

A `THREE.Material` defines the visual properties of a mesh.  It determines how the mesh's surface appears, including color, texture, reflectivity, and other visual attributes.  Three.js provides various material types:

* **`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`:** A simple material that doesn't use lighting.  Good for quick prototyping or situations where lighting isn't necessary.

* **`THREE.MeshStandardMaterial`:**  A physically-based material that accurately simulates lighting interactions.  This is often preferred for realistic rendering.

* **`THREE.MeshLambertMaterial`:** A material that uses diffuse lighting only.

Each material type has its own set of properties to customize its appearance.


### Geometries

A `THREE.Geometry` (or the more performant `THREE.BufferGeometry`) defines the shape of a mesh.  It's a collection of vertices, faces, and other geometric data that define the mesh's structure.  Three.js provides predefined geometries like `BoxGeometry`, `SphereGeometry`, `PlaneGeometry`, etc., for common shapes.  You can also create custom geometries for more complex shapes.  `BufferGeometry` is generally recommended for better performance with large datasets.


### Lights

`THREE.Light` objects illuminate the scene, making meshes visible.  Three.js provides several light types:

* **`THREE.AmbientLight`:** Provides a uniform ambient light that affects all objects equally.

* **`THREE.DirectionalLight`:** Simulates a directional light source, like the sun, shining from a specific direction.

* **`THREE.PointLight`:** Simulates a point light source, emitting light in all directions.

* **`THREE.SpotLight`:** Simulates a spotlight, emitting light within a cone shape.

Each light type has properties for color, intensity, and other parameters.


### Textures

`THREE.Texture` objects add image-based detail to your meshes.  You can apply textures to materials to add realism and visual complexity.  Textures can be loaded from image files (like JPG, PNG) or generated procedurally.  The `THREE.TextureLoader` class is used to load textures from image files asynchronously.  Properties like `wrapS` and `wrapT` control how the texture repeats across the mesh's surface.


### Transforms

Transforms are operations that change the position, rotation, and scale of objects in the scene.  Every `Object3D` has properties to control these transforms:

* **`position`:**  A `THREE.Vector3` defining the object's location in 3D space.

* **`rotation`:** A `THREE.Euler` (or `THREE.Quaternion`) defining the object's orientation.  Euler angles (x, y, z) are commonly used, but Quaternions are preferred for avoiding gimbal lock.

* **`scale`:** A `THREE.Vector3` defining the object's scaling factor along each axis.

These transforms can be applied individually or combined to create complex movements and animations.  The scene graph's hierarchical structure allows for parent-child relationships, enabling efficient manipulation of groups of objects.


## Working with Geometries

### Basic Geometries (Box, Sphere, Cylinder, etc.)

Three.js provides a set of pre-built geometries for common 3D shapes. These are convenient for quickly creating basic objects in your scenes.  They are subclasses of `THREE.Geometry` (though using `THREE.BufferGeometry` is generally recommended for performance reasons; see below).  Key examples include:

* **`THREE.BoxGeometry(width, height, depth, widthSegments, heightSegments, depthSegments)`:** Creates a cube or rectangular prism.  `widthSegments`, `heightSegments`, and `depthSegments` control the number of segments along each axis, affecting the level of detail.

* **`THREE.SphereGeometry(radius, widthSegments, heightSegments, phiStart, phiLength, thetaStart, thetaLength)`:** Creates a sphere.  `widthSegments` and `heightSegments` control the resolution.  The other parameters allow for creating partial spheres.

* **`THREE.CylinderGeometry(radiusTop, radiusBottom, height, radialSegments, heightSegments, openEnded, thetaStart, thetaLength)`:** Creates a cylinder.  Parameters control radii, height, and segmentation.  `openEnded` determines whether the top and bottom are capped.

* **`THREE.PlaneGeometry(width, height, widthSegments, heightSegments)`:** Creates a flat plane. Useful for ground planes or simple surfaces.


These geometries are easy to use; you simply create an instance and pass it to a `THREE.Mesh` along with a material:

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
```

Remember to consult the Three.js documentation for the complete list of parameters for each geometry type.


### Custom Geometries

For shapes not provided by the built-in geometries, you can create custom geometries using `THREE.Geometry` or `THREE.BufferGeometry`.  `THREE.Geometry` is simpler for understanding the underlying principles, but `THREE.BufferGeometry` offers significant performance advantages, especially for complex shapes or large numbers of vertices.


Using `THREE.Geometry`:  You manually define vertices and faces.

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(-1, -1, 0));
geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(1, -1, 0));
geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(1, 1, 0));
geometry.faces.push(new THREE.Face3(0, 1, 2));
```

This creates a simple triangle.  More complex shapes require more vertices and faces.  Note that `THREE.Geometry` is less efficient than `BufferGeometry`, particularly for large models.


### BufferGeometry

`THREE.BufferGeometry` is the recommended approach for creating custom geometries, especially for performance-critical applications.  It uses typed arrays for efficient vertex data storage.  Instead of directly manipulating vertices and faces as with `THREE.Geometry`, you define attributes like `position`, `normal`, `uv`, etc., using `BufferAttribute` objects.

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
const positions = new Float32Array([
  -1.0, -1.0, 0.0,
   1.0, -1.0, 0.0,
   1.0,  1.0, 0.0
]);
const positionAttribute = new THREE.BufferAttribute(positions, 3); // 3 components per vertex (x, y, z)
geometry.setAttribute('position', positionAttribute);
```

This achieves the same triangle as the `THREE.Geometry` example but with superior performance.  Learn about defining other attributes like normals and UV coordinates for more complex shapes and materials.


### Geometry Modifiers

Three.js doesn't offer built-in geometry modifiers in the same way some modeling software does. However, you can achieve similar effects by manipulating the geometry's attributes directly. For example, to extrude a shape, you would add new vertices and faces representing the extrusion.  Library extensions or custom functions can simplify common modifications.  For more advanced geometry manipulation, you might explore libraries that build upon Three.js or utilize external geometry processing tools before loading the processed geometry into your Three.js scene.


## Materials and Textures

### Basic Materials (MeshBasicMaterial, MeshStandardMaterial, etc.)

Materials define the visual appearance of your meshes in Three.js.  Three.js offers a variety of materials, each with different properties and rendering capabilities:

* **`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`:**  The simplest material. It doesn't use lighting calculations; the color is directly applied to the surface.  Good for quick prototyping or stylized visuals where lighting isn't crucial.  Properties include `color`, `map` (for textures), and `wireframe` (to display the mesh's wireframe).

* **`THREE.MeshStandardMaterial`:** A physically-based rendering (PBR) material that simulates realistic lighting interactions.  It considers diffuse, specular, and other lighting components for a more accurate representation. Properties include `color`, `metalness`, `roughness`, `map`, `normalMap`, `aoMap` (ambient occlusion), and more. This is generally preferred for realistic visuals.

* **`THREE.MeshLambertMaterial`:**  Uses diffuse lighting only, resulting in a matte appearance.  Simpler than `MeshStandardMaterial` but less realistic.

* **`THREE.MeshPhongMaterial`:**  Similar to `MeshLambertMaterial` but also incorporates specular highlights.


Choosing the right material depends on the desired visual style and performance requirements.  `MeshStandardMaterial` is a good starting point for realistic rendering, while `MeshBasicMaterial` is suitable for simpler, unlit scenes.


### Material Properties

Each material type has its own set of properties to customize its appearance.  Common properties include:

* **`color`:** Sets the base color of the material.  Can be specified as a hexadecimal color code (e.g., `0xff0000` for red) or a `THREE.Color` object.

* **`map`:**  Assigns a texture to the material's surface.  (See Loading and Using Textures section).

* **`normalMap`:**  Adds surface detail by simulating bumps and irregularities.

* **`roughness`:**  Controls the surface roughness (for PBR materials).  A higher value results in a more matte appearance.

* **`metalness`:** Controls the metallic properties of the surface (for PBR materials).

* **`emissive`:**  Sets a self-illuminating color.

* **`transparent`:**  Makes the material transparent.  Requires setting `opacity` as well.

* **`opacity`:**  Controls the transparency level (0.0 fully transparent, 1.0 fully opaque).

Consult the Three.js documentation for a comprehensive list of material properties and their specific uses.


### Loading and Using Textures

Textures are images applied to the surface of materials to add detail and realism.  You load textures using a `THREE.TextureLoader`:

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = loader.load('path/to/your/texture.jpg', function (texture) {
  // Texture loaded successfully
  material.map = texture;
  material.needsUpdate = true; // Important: signals to Three.js to update the material
});
```

The `load()` method takes the texture's path and a callback function that's executed once the texture is loaded. The `needsUpdate = true;` is crucial; it informs Three.js that the material needs to be re-rendered with the new texture.

Supported image formats include JPG, PNG, and others.  Error handling should be included to manage potential loading failures.


### Texture Mapping

Texture mapping determines how the texture is applied to the mesh's surface.  Three.js handles this automatically for most basic geometries.  However, for complex geometries or custom mapping, you might need to adjust UV coordinates.  UV coordinates are 2D coordinates (0-1 range) that map texture pixels to vertices on the mesh.  You can manipulate UVs within a `THREE.BufferGeometry` using the `uv` attribute.


### Advanced Materials

For more advanced rendering effects, consider these options:

* **ShaderMaterial:**  Provides fine-grained control over the rendering process using custom GLSL shaders. This offers maximum flexibility but requires knowledge of shader programming.

* **RawShaderMaterial:** Similar to ShaderMaterial but without automatic handling of certain properties.

* **PointsMaterial:** Used for rendering point clouds.

* **SpriteMaterial:**  Renders 2D sprites in a 3D scene.

These materials allow you to implement advanced techniques such as custom lighting models, post-processing effects, and other sophisticated visual effects.  They offer greater control but come with increased complexity.




## Lighting

### Ambient Light

`THREE.AmbientLight` provides a uniform, non-directional light source that illuminates all objects in the scene equally. It's useful for adding a general, subtle illumination to the scene, but it doesn't create realistic shadows or highlights. It's often used in conjunction with other light types to provide base illumination.

```javascript
const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040); // soft white light
scene.add(ambientLight);
```

The constructor takes a color as an argument.  Adjust the color and intensity to fine-tune the ambient lighting effect.


### Directional Light

`THREE.DirectionalLight` simulates a light source infinitely far away, like the sun. It casts parallel rays of light across the scene, resulting in uniform shadows.  The light's direction is defined by its position and its `target` (which it points towards).

```javascript
const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.5); // white light, intensity 0.5
scene.add(directionalLight);
directionalLight.position.set(1, 1, 1); // Set light direction
```

The constructor takes a color and intensity.  The `position` property determines the light's direction; its magnitude is not relevant in directional lights (only direction matters). Consider adding a helper (like `DirectionalLightHelper`) for visualizing the direction.  To cast shadows, enable the `castShadow` property and configure shadow map parameters on the renderer and camera.


### Point Light

`THREE.PointLight` simulates a light source that emits light in all directions from a single point in space.  It creates a falloff effect, where light intensity decreases with distance.

```javascript
const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xff0000, 1, 100); // red light, intensity 1, range 100
scene.add(pointLight);
pointLight.position.set(5, 5, 5);
```

The constructor takes color, intensity, and distance (range).  The light's intensity diminishes smoothly beyond the specified distance.  `castShadow` can be enabled to cast shadows, though this is computationally more expensive than directional shadows.


### Spot Light

`THREE.SpotLight` simulates a spotlight, emitting light within a cone shape.  It's defined by its position, direction, angle, and penumbra.

```javascript
const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight(0x0000ff, 1, 100, Math.PI / 4, 0.5); // blue light, intensity 1, range 100, angle 45 degrees, penumbra 0.5
scene.add(spotLight);
spotLight.position.set(0, 10, 0);
spotLight.target.position.set(0, 0, 0); // Point the spotlight at the origin
```

Parameters include color, intensity, distance, angle (cone's opening angle), and penumbra (softness of the shadow edges).  `target` property defines the direction. Enabling `castShadow` allows for spotlight shadows.


### Hemisphere Light

`THREE.HemisphereLight` simulates a sky/ground ambient light, with a color for the sky and another for the ground.  It provides soft, ambient illumination that varies based on the object's orientation.  Useful for subtle, natural-looking ambient lighting.

```javascript
const hemisphereLight = new THREE.HemisphereLight(0xAAAAFF, 0x000000, 0.8); // Sky color, ground color, intensity
scene.add(hemisphereLight);
```

Parameters are sky color, ground color, and intensity.


### Shadows

To enable shadows, several steps are required:

1. **Light:**  Set the light's `castShadow` property to `true`.

2. **Mesh:** Set the mesh's `castShadow` property to `true` for objects that cast shadows.

3. **Mesh:** Set the mesh's `receiveShadow` property to `true` for objects that receive shadows.

4. **Renderer:**  Configure the renderer's shadow map parameters (e.g., `shadowMap.enabled = true;`).

5. **Camera:** Configure appropriate camera parameters (e.g., shadow camera properties) for optimal shadow rendering.


Proper shadow configuration requires careful adjustment of parameters for performance and visual quality.  Experiment with shadow map size and camera frustum to find the best balance. Using shadow helpers can aid in visualization.  Remember that shadows are computationally expensive.  Optimize the number of objects casting and receiving shadows, and consider techniques like shadow cascades for larger scenes.




## Cameras and Controls

### Perspective Camera

The `THREE.PerspectiveCamera` simulates a real-world camera, with objects appearing smaller as they get farther away. It provides a realistic sense of depth and perspective.  It's defined by its field of view (FOV), aspect ratio, near clipping plane, and far clipping plane.

```javascript
const fov = 75; // Field of view (degrees)
const aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight; // Aspect ratio
const near = 0.1; // Near clipping plane
const far = 1000; // Far clipping plane
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(fov, aspect, near, far);
camera.position.z = 5; // Position the camera
scene.add(camera);
```

* **`fov`:**  The vertical field of view in degrees.  A wider FOV shows more of the scene, while a narrower FOV provides a more zoomed-in view.

* **`aspect`:** The ratio of the width to the height of the viewport (usually `window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight`).  Maintaining the correct aspect ratio is essential to avoid distortion.

* **`near`:** The distance to the nearest clipping plane.  Objects closer than this distance won't be rendered.

* **`far`:** The distance to the farthest clipping plane. Objects farther than this won't be rendered.

Adjusting these parameters is crucial for framing your scene effectively.  The `position` property determines the camera's location.  The camera also implicitly "looks" down the negative Z-axis; use `camera.lookAt(target)` to make the camera point at a specific object or point in space.


### Orthographic Camera

The `THREE.OrthographicCamera` creates a parallel projection, where objects remain the same size regardless of their distance from the camera. This is useful for technical drawings, top-down views, or situations where a consistent scale is needed.  It's defined by its left, right, top, bottom, near, and far clipping planes.

```javascript
const width = window.innerWidth;
const height = window.innerHeight;
const camera = new THREE.OrthographicCamera(width / -2, width / 2, height / 2, height / -2, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;
scene.add(camera);
```

* **`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`:** Define the camera's viewing frustum in screen coordinates.  The values typically relate to window dimensions.

* **`near`, `far`:** Clipping planes, similar to the perspective camera.

Orthographic cameras are less realistic than perspective cameras but offer advantages for specific applications.


### Camera Controls (OrbitControls, TrackballControls)

Three.js itself doesn't provide built-in camera controls.  However, many excellent third-party libraries offer camera manipulation capabilities.  The most popular are:

* **`OrbitControls`:**  Provides intuitive orbit, pan, and zoom controls, allowing users to rotate around a target point. This is a very common choice.

* **`TrackballControls`:** Offers a trackball-like control scheme, where dragging the mouse rotates the camera.

These controls are typically included as separate libraries (e.g., via npm or a CDN).  You then initialize the controls, linking them to your camera and the renderer's DOM element.  Refer to each control library's documentation for specific usage instructions.


### Custom Camera Controls

For advanced or specialized camera controls not offered by existing libraries, you can create custom controls by directly manipulating the camera's position, rotation, and other properties in response to user input (keyboard, mouse, touch).  This requires handling events like `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, etc., and updating the camera's transform accordingly.  This approach provides maximum flexibility but requires more development effort and careful consideration of user experience.  Creating smooth and responsive controls requires knowledge of camera projections and transformations.  Be mindful of performance considerations; intensive calculations for complex controls can impact rendering framerates.


## Animations

### Animation Basics

Three.js offers several ways to animate 3D scenes.  Animations generally involve modifying object properties (position, rotation, scale, material properties, etc.) over time.  The simplest approach is to directly update these properties within a `requestAnimationFrame` loop.

```javascript
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

This code continuously rotates a cube.  While simple, this method is suitable only for basic animations.  For more complex scenarios, use keyframe animations or `AnimationMixer`.


### Keyframe Animations

Keyframe animations define object properties at specific points in time (keyframes).  Three.js provides tools to create and play keyframe animations:

1. **`THREE.AnimationClip`:**  Represents an animation clip, defining the animation data (keyframes).  You create this from existing animation data (often loaded from external files like FBX or glTF).

2. **`THREE.AnimationAction`:**  Manages the playback of an animation clip.  You start, stop, and control the animation's speed, time scale, etc., through an action.

3. **`THREE.AnimationMixer`:**  A central component for managing multiple animation actions.


Typically, you load animation data from a model file (e.g., using `GLTFLoader` or `FBXLoader`).  The loader parses the animation data and provides `THREE.AnimationClip` objects. Then, create actions using `mixer.clipAction(clip)` to control the animations.



### Using AnimationMixer

`THREE.AnimationMixer` provides a robust system for managing animations, especially when dealing with multiple animations on different objects.

```javascript
const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(object); //Create a mixer linked to your animated object.
const clip = THREE.AnimationClip.findByName(object.animations, 'myAnimation'); //Find AnimationClip
const action = mixer.clipAction(clip);
action.play();

function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    mixer.update(delta); //Update the mixer in the animation loop; delta is the time elapsed since the last frame
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

The `update(delta)` method is crucial—it updates the animation based on the time elapsed (`delta`).  This ensures smooth and consistent animation playback.  You can control aspects like playback speed, looping, and blending multiple animations through the `action` object.


### Custom Animations

For highly customized animations not easily represented with keyframes, you can create animations by directly manipulating object properties within the `requestAnimationFrame` loop.  This involves calculating property values based on time or other factors.  This offers great flexibility, but requires careful planning and implementation to ensure smooth, realistic animations. You would need to handle interpolation yourself (linear, easing functions, etc.) to get smooth transitions between animation states.  This can be more resource-intensive than using keyframe animations for complex scenarios.  For very complex, highly optimized animations, consider using shader-based animation techniques.




## Working with Scenes and Objects

### Adding and Removing Objects

The Three.js scene graph is a hierarchical structure.  The `THREE.Scene` object acts as the root of this graph.  You add objects to the scene using the `scene.add(object)` method.  Objects can be meshes, lights, cameras, or any other `THREE.Object3D` derivative.

```javascript
const cubeGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(cubeGeometry, cubeMaterial);
scene.add(cube); // Add the cube to the scene
```

To remove an object, use the `scene.remove(object)` method.

```javascript
scene.remove(cube); // Remove the cube from the scene
```

Removing an object from the scene graph removes it from rendering and from the scene's hierarchy.


### Object Transformations

Object transformations involve changing an object's position, rotation, and scale within the 3D space.  Each `THREE.Object3D` instance has properties to control these:

* **`position`:** A `THREE.Vector3` representing the object's location (x, y, z).

* **`rotation`:**  A `THREE.Euler` (or `THREE.Quaternion`) representing the object's rotation.  Using `THREE.Quaternion` is generally preferred to avoid gimbal lock.  Rotation can also be applied using methods like `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `rotateZ`.

* **`scale`:** A `THREE.Vector3` representing the object's scaling factor along each axis (x, y, z).


```javascript
cube.position.set(1, 2, 3); // Set the cube's position
cube.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2; // Rotate the cube 90 degrees around the x-axis
cube.scale.set(2, 2, 2);     // Double the cube's size
```

These transformations are relative to the object's parent object (or the world if it doesn't have a parent).  Transformations are applied in the order: scale, rotation, then translation (SRT).


### Parenting and Grouping

Parenting in Three.js creates a hierarchical relationship between objects.  A parent object's transformations affect its children.  This is useful for creating complex assemblies where moving one part automatically moves its connected parts.  You add a child object to a parent using `parentObject.add(childObject)`.

```javascript
const parent = new THREE.Object3D();
scene.add(parent); // Add the parent to the scene
parent.add(cube); // Add the cube as a child of the parent
```

Now, transformations applied to `parent` also affect `cube`.  This approach is much more efficient than individually transforming many objects in a group.  For organizational purposes or to apply transformations to a group of objects simultaneously, consider grouping objects as children of an empty `THREE.Object3D`.

### Scene Management

Managing complex scenes efficiently requires careful organization and techniques:

* **Object Reuse:** Create reusable object instances to avoid redundant geometry and material creation.

* **Scene Graph Optimization:** Optimize the scene graph hierarchy by grouping related objects.  Deeply nested hierarchies can negatively impact rendering performance.

* **Object Disposal:** When objects are no longer needed, dispose of their geometries and materials using `geometry.dispose()` and `material.dispose()` to free up memory.

* **Level of Detail (LOD):** Use LOD techniques to switch to simpler geometry for objects far from the camera, improving performance.

* **Frustum Culling:** Three.js automatically performs frustum culling (removing objects outside the camera's view frustum), but understanding its limitations can help you optimize scene structures.

* **Data Structures:** For extremely complex scenes, consider advanced data structures to manage and access objects efficiently.


Effective scene management improves application performance and reduces memory consumption, especially for large or complex 3D environments.  Tools like scene graph visualizers can help to analyze and optimize your scene structure.


## Advanced Techniques

### Post-processing Effects

Post-processing effects modify the rendered image after it's been generated by the renderer.  This allows for adding visual enhancements or special effects without altering the 3D scene itself.  Popular techniques include:

* **Bloom:**  Creates a glowing effect around bright areas.

* **Tone Mapping:** Adjusts the brightness and contrast of the rendered image to improve visual quality, particularly in high dynamic range (HDR) scenes.

* **Anti-aliasing (AA):** Reduces jagged edges (aliasing) in rendered images for smoother visuals.  Three.js offers MSAA (Multisample Anti-Aliasing).

* **Depth of Field (DOF):**  Simulates the blurring effect of a shallow depth of field in cameras, drawing focus to specific parts of the scene.

* **SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion):**  Simulates ambient occlusion using screen-space information for more realistic shading.

These effects are often implemented using framebuffers and shaders.  Libraries like three.js-postprocessing provide pre-built implementations of many common post-processing effects, simplifying their integration into your projects.  They typically involve rendering the scene to a texture, processing the texture using a shader, and then displaying the resulting image.

### Rendering to Textures

Rendering to textures involves rendering a scene or part of a scene to a texture instead of directly to the screen. This technique is frequently used for:

* **Post-processing:** (As described above)  The scene is rendered to a texture, then processed using a shader.

* **Reflection and Refraction:**  Scenes can be rendered to a texture and then used as a reflection map or refraction map for reflective or refractive materials.

* **Shadow Mapping:**  A depth map (a texture storing depth information) is used to generate shadows.

* **Off-screen rendering:**  Rendering complex parts of the scene separately allows for more efficient rendering and allows you to do certain calculations in parallel.

The process usually involves creating a `THREE.WebGLRenderTarget` (or similar), configuring it with the desired size and texture format, and then rendering the scene to this target.  The resulting texture can then be used as a map for materials or processed further.


### Shaders

Shaders are programs written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) that run on the GPU.  They provide fine-grained control over the rendering process, allowing for highly customized visual effects and optimizations.  Three.js supports the use of custom shaders via the `ShaderMaterial`:

```javascript
const shaderMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader: vertexShaderCode,
  fragmentShader: fragmentShaderCode,
  uniforms: {
    time: { value: 0.0 } // Example uniform
  }
});
```

You provide the vertex shader code (processing vertex data) and the fragment shader code (processing pixel data).  Uniforms allow passing data from JavaScript to the shaders.  Shaders offer immense power but require a strong understanding of GLSL and shader programming concepts.


### Physics Integration

Integrating physics engines with Three.js adds realistic physical simulations to your scenes.  Popular choices include:

* **Cannon.js:** A lightweight JavaScript physics engine.

* **Ammo.js:**  A port of the Bullet Physics engine to JavaScript.

* **Oimo.js:** Another JavaScript physics engine.


These libraries typically work by creating physics objects corresponding to your Three.js objects.  You then simulate the physics using the engine's update loop, and the results (positions, velocities) are applied back to the Three.js objects.


### Performance Optimization

Performance optimization is crucial for large or complex Three.js applications. Techniques include:

* **Draw Calls:**  Minimize the number of draw calls by grouping objects with the same material and using techniques like instancing.

* **Geometry Optimization:**  Use optimized geometries (like `BufferGeometry`) and reduce the number of polygons in meshes.  Consider LOD (Level of Detail) techniques.

* **Texture Optimization:**  Use appropriately sized textures with optimal compression to minimize memory usage and rendering overhead.

* **Shader Optimization:**  Write efficient and optimized shaders, avoiding redundant calculations.

* **Scene Graph Optimization:**  Keep the scene graph well-organized and avoid deep nesting.

* **Frustum Culling:**  Use Three.js's built-in frustum culling to eliminate objects outside the camera's view.

* **Web Workers:**  Offload computationally intensive tasks (like physics calculations) to web workers to prevent blocking the main thread.

* **Profiling:**  Use browser developer tools to profile your application and identify performance bottlenecks.


Careful attention to these aspects ensures smoother animations and better overall performance in demanding Three.js applications.


## Loading External Resources

### Loading Models (glTF, FBX)

Three.js provides loaders for various 3D model formats.  The most commonly used are `GLTFLoader` (for glTF models) and `FBXLoader` (for FBX models).  glTF is generally preferred for its efficiency and wide support.

**glTF Loading:**

```javascript
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load(
  'path/to/model.gltf',
  (gltf) => {
    const model = gltf.scene;
    scene.add(model);
  },
  (xhr) => {
    console.log((xhr.loaded / xhr.total) * 100 + '% loaded');
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  }
);
```

This code loads a glTF model.  The `load` method takes the model path and three callback functions: one for successful loading, one for progress updates, and one for error handling.  The loaded model (`gltf.scene`) is then added to the scene.  Remember that `GLTFLoader` needs to be imported from the `three/examples/jsm/loaders` directory (adjust path if necessary based on your project structure).

**FBX Loading:**  Similar to glTF loading, but using `FBXLoader`:

```javascript
import { FBXLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/FBXLoader.js';

const loader = new FBXLoader();
loader.load(
  'path/to/model.fbx',
  (object) => {
    scene.add(object);
  },
  // ... progress and error callbacks as above
);
```

FBX files can be larger than glTF and might take longer to load.


### Loading Textures

Textures are loaded using `THREE.TextureLoader`:

```javascript
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
textureLoader.load(
  'path/to/texture.jpg',
  (texture) => {
    material.map = texture;
    material.needsUpdate = true; // Important!
  },
  // ... progress and error callbacks
);
```

This loads a texture from the specified path. The loaded texture is then assigned to a material's `map` property.  The `needsUpdate` flag is essential to signal Three.js to update the material with the new texture.  Error handling is recommended.


### Asynchronous Loading

The examples above demonstrate asynchronous loading.  This is crucial for avoiding blocking the main thread while waiting for resources to load.  Asynchronous loading ensures that the application remains responsive while resources are fetched.  Progress callbacks provide feedback to the user.  Error handling is critical to gracefully manage potential loading failures.


### Resource Management

Efficient resource management is important for performance, especially in applications loading numerous models or textures.  Key considerations include:

* **Caching:**  Implement caching mechanisms to avoid repeatedly loading the same resources.

* **Disposal:**  When resources are no longer needed, explicitly dispose of them using methods like `texture.dispose()` and `geometry.dispose()`. This frees up memory and improves performance.

* **Compression:**  Use appropriately compressed textures and models to reduce download sizes and improve loading times.

* **Loading Prioritization:** Prioritize the loading of critical resources (for example, load the essential game assets before less crucial elements).

* **Lazy Loading:**  Only load resources when they are actually needed, rather than loading everything upfront.

* **Progress Indicators:**  Display a progress indicator to the user to show the loading progress.

Careful resource management ensures your Three.js applications remain performant and responsive, even with many external assets.


## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

Several common errors arise when working with Three.js:

* **"THREE is not defined":** This usually means that the Three.js library hasn't been correctly included in your HTML file.  Ensure the `<script>` tag linking to the Three.js library is present and the path is accurate.

* **WebGL context creation errors:**  These errors often stem from browser incompatibility with WebGL, missing drivers, or hardware limitations.  Check the browser's console for specific error messages and ensure WebGL is enabled.

* **Incorrect geometry or material setup:**  Typos or incorrect parameters in geometry or material definitions can lead to unexpected rendering results.  Double-check all property values and ensure correct object instantiation.

* **Transformation issues:**  Incorrect transformations (position, rotation, scale) can result in objects being invisible or rendered incorrectly.  Use the Three.js inspector or helpers to visualize object transforms.

* **Texture loading errors:**  Incorrect paths or issues with the texture format can prevent textures from loading correctly.  Check the console for error messages and ensure the texture file exists at the specified path and is in a compatible format.

* **Memory leaks:**  Failing to dispose of unused resources (textures, geometries, materials) can lead to memory leaks over time.  Use `dispose()` methods for all unnecessary objects.

* **Shader compilation errors:**  Incorrect GLSL code in custom shaders leads to compilation errors.  Carefully review the shader code for typos and syntax errors. The browser's console often reports detailed shader compiler errors.

* **Incorrect scene graph setup:**  Problems with parenting or object hierarchy can cause unexpected behavior.  Ensure a clear and organized scene graph.


### Debugging Tools

Several tools aid in debugging Three.js applications:

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use the browser's built-in developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the console for error messages, network requests (for resource loading), and performance information.

* **Three.js Inspector:** This is a browser extension (available for Chrome and Firefox) that provides a visual inspector for your Three.js scene.  It lets you examine objects, their properties, and their transformations interactively.

* **Custom Helpers:** Create custom helper objects (e.g., using lines or boxes) to visually represent important elements in your scene and debug their positions, orientations and sizes.  Three.js provides various built-in helpers (like AxisHelper, GridHelper).

* **Logging:**  Strategically use `console.log` statements to inspect the values of variables and track the execution flow of your code.

* **Debugging Libraries:**  Some debugging libraries may be beneficial for stepping through your code and inspecting variable values.

* **Frame debuggers:** Chrome DevTools allow you to debug three.js code on a frame-by-frame basis which is very helpful for complex interactions.


### Performance Profiling

Performance profiling helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your Three.js application.  Tools include:

* **Browser Profilers:**  The browser's developer tools usually include performance profilers that can record the execution time of different parts of your code.  Use the profiler to pinpoint functions or loops consuming excessive time.

* **Custom Timers:**  Add custom timers to your code using `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` to measure the execution time of specific blocks of code.

* **Frame Rate Monitoring:**  Monitor the frame rate (frames per second) to assess overall performance.  A dropping frame rate indicates performance issues.

* **Memory Profiling:**  Use the browser's memory profiler to detect memory leaks and excessive memory usage.

* **Three.js Stats:**  A lightweight performance monitor that displays frame rate, render time, and memory usage.  Include this in your application to get a real-time view of performance metrics.


Once performance bottlenecks are identified, optimize your code by reducing draw calls, simplifying geometry, improving shader efficiency, and implementing other optimization techniques discussed earlier.  Consistent profiling and optimization are important for delivering high-performing Three.js applications.


## Examples and Case Studies

These examples illustrate different aspects of Three.js development, progressing from simple to more complex scenarios.  Refer to the official Three.js examples for more comprehensive demonstrations.  Remember to adapt code snippets to your project structure and dependencies.


### Simple Scene Example

This example renders a single cube in a scene:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );
const cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( cube );

camera.position.z = 5;

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame( animate );
  renderer.render( scene, camera );
}
animate();
```

This code sets up a basic scene, adds a green cube, and renders it.  It's a minimal example demonstrating the fundamental components of a Three.js application.


### Interactive Scene Example

This example adds basic user interaction:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls'; // Import OrbitControls

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0xff0000});
const sphere = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(sphere);

camera.position.z = 5;

const controls = new OrbitControls( camera, renderer.domElement );

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame( animate );
  controls.update(); //Update the orbit controls
  renderer.render( scene, camera );
}
animate();
```

This example adds `OrbitControls`, allowing the user to rotate the camera around the sphere.  This introduces user interaction, a key feature in many Three.js applications.  Remember to install `OrbitControls` (likely via a package manager like npm).


### Complex Scene Example

Complex scenes involve multiple objects, materials, lighting, animations, and potentially external resources.  An example (highly simplified) might include loading a model, adding lighting, and implementing basic animation:

```javascript
// ... (Import necessary loaders and modules, similar to previous examples) ...

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.load('path/to/complex_model.gltf', (gltf) => {
    const model = gltf.scene;
    scene.add(model);

    // Add lights (ambient and directional for example)
    const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040);
    scene.add(ambientLight);
    const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.5);
    scene.add(directionalLight);

    //Add animation mixer (if the model has animations)
    const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(model);
    const animationAction = mixer.clipAction(gltf.animations[0]); // Assuming the model has at least one animation clip
    animationAction.play();


    function animate() {
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        mixer.update(clock.getDelta()); //Update animation mixer if needed.
        renderer.render(scene, camera);
    }
    animate();
});

// ... (Rest of the scene setup, camera, renderer) ...
```

This example demonstrates loading a complex model, adding lighting, and optionally including animation.  Real-world complex scenes often incorporate advanced techniques like post-processing, shaders, physics, and efficient resource management.  The complexity grows significantly with these additions.  This example omits many details for brevity; a complete example would require more code and careful consideration of performance and scene organization.  Remember to handle potential errors during loading and handle animations correctly.
