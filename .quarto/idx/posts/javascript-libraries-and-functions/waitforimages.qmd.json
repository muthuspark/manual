It provides a reliable way to ensure that your application's layout and functionality are not impacted by images that are still loading.  The function returns a Promise, allowing for asynchronous integration with modern JavaScript workflows.\n\n### Why use waitForImages?\n\nUsing `waitForImages` prevents race conditions where code dependent on image dimensions or presence might execute prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior or visual glitches.  For example, if you calculate the layout of a webpage based on image sizes before the images have fully loaded, your layout will be incorrect. `waitForImages` synchronizes your code with the image loading process, ensuring that all image data is available before proceeding.  This results in more robust and predictable application behavior.\n\n### When to use waitForImages?\n\nYou should use `waitForImages` whenever your JavaScript code relies on the complete loading of images.  This includes scenarios such as:\n\n* **Layout calculations:** When you need accurate image dimensions to position elements correctly on the page.\n* **Image manipulation:**  Before applying effects or modifications to images using JavaScript libraries.\n* **Asynchronous operations:** When other asynchronous operations depend on images being fully loaded.\n* **Testing:** When automating tests and need to ensure that images have fully loaded before verifying page content.\n* **Preventing visual glitches:** To avoid displaying placeholder content or partially loaded images to the user.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\n`waitForImages` can be installed via npm or yarn:\n\n```bash\nnpm install wait-for-images  //or\nyarn add wait-for-images\n```\n\nThis will add the `wait-for-images` package to your project's dependencies.  Make sure you have Node.js and either npm or yarn installed on your system.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nAfter installation, import the `waitForImages` function into your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\nimport waitForImages from 'wait-for-images';\n```\n\nThe `waitForImages` function accepts two arguments:\n\n1. **`selector` (string or HTMLElement):**  A CSS selector string or an HTMLElement representing the container element containing the images. If omitted or set to `null`, it defaults to the entire document (`document.body`).\n\n2. **`options` (object, optional):** An object containing optional configuration parameters.  Currently, there are no supported options.  This parameter is included for potential future expansion.\n\nThe function returns a Promise that resolves when all images within the specified element have finished loading.  If any image fails to load, the Promise will reject.\n\n### Example: Simple Implementation\n\nThis example waits for all images within the element with the ID \"my-image-container\" to load before displaying a message:\n\n```javascript\nimport waitForImages from 'wait-for-images';\n\nconst imageContainer = document.getElementById('my-image-container');\n\nwaitForImages(imageContainer)\n  .then(() => {\n    console.log('All images loaded!');\n    // Proceed with code that depends on images being loaded\n    document.getElementById('message').style.display = 'block';\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error('Error loading images:', error);\n    // Handle image loading errors\n  });\n```\n\nRemember to have an element with the ID \"my-image-container\" and an element with ID \"message\" (initially hidden using `display: none;`) in your HTML for this example to work correctly.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### waitForImages(selector, options)\n\nThe core function of the library.  It waits for all images within a specified element to load before resolving the returned Promise.\n\n### Parameters: selector\n\n* **Type:** `string | HTMLElement | null`\n* **Description:**  Specifies the element containing the images to wait for.  It can be:\n    * A CSS selector string (e.g., `\"#my-container img\"`).\n    * An HTMLElement object.\n    * `null` (or omitted), in which case it defaults to the entire document (`document.body`).\n\n\n### Parameters: options\n\n* **Type:** `object`\n* **Description:** An object containing optional configuration parameters.  All options are optional.\n\n### Options: timeout\n\n* **Type:** `number`\n* **Description:** The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for images to load before rejecting the Promise.  Defaults to 0 (no timeout).  If a timeout occurs, the Promise will reject with an error indicating that the timeout was reached.\n\n\n### Options: interval\n\n* **Type:** `number`\n* **Description:** The interval (in milliseconds) at which the function checks the loading status of the images.  Defaults to 100ms.  A smaller interval increases resource consumption but provides more frequent checks.\n\n\n### Options: completeCallback\n\n* **Type:** `function`\n* **Description:** A callback function that is executed when all images have loaded successfully. The callback will receive no arguments. This provides an alternative to using `.then()` on the returned promise.\n\n### Options: incompleteCallback\n\n* **Type:** `function`\n* **Description:** A callback function that is executed if any image fails to load or the timeout is reached.  The callback will receive the `Error` object as its only argument.  This provides an alternative to using `.catch()` on the returned promise.\n\n\n### Return Value\n\n* **Type:** `Promise<void>`\n* **Description:** A Promise that resolves when all images within the specified selector have finished loading. The Promise resolves with no value (`void`).  The Promise rejects if any image fails to load or a timeout occurs.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf any image fails to load or the specified timeout is reached, the Promise returned by `waitForImages` will reject. The rejected Promise will contain an `Error` object as its reason.  The error object's message will describe the reason for the rejection (e.g., \"Timeout reached\" or \"Image loading failed\"). You should handle potential errors using the `.catch()` method of the Promise or by providing an `incompleteCallback` function.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Handling Different Image Types\n\n`waitForImages` automatically handles various image types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) without requiring any special configuration.  It detects the `complete` property of the image element to determine if an image has finished loading.  This approach is robust and generally handles most image loading scenarios effectively.  However, for very unusual image loading behaviors or custom image loading mechanisms, more sophisticated solutions might be necessary.\n\n### Working with Dynamically Loaded Images\n\nIf images are loaded dynamically after the initial page load (e.g., using JavaScript to append images), you'll need to call `waitForImages` again after the images have been added to the DOM.  The best approach is to call `waitForImages` within a callback function that is executed after the dynamic image loading is complete. For example, if you are using a library that triggers an event after images are loaded, you could attach a listener to that event, and call `waitForImages` in its callback. Alternatively, you can set a timeout to ensure that the images have loaded.\n\n### Integration with Other Libraries\n\n`waitForImages` can be seamlessly integrated with other JavaScript libraries.  Use it after any library that modifies the DOM or adds images has finished its operation. This ensures that `waitForImages` waits for all images, including those added by external libraries.\n\n### Customizing the Loading Process\n\nCurrently, `waitForImages` doesn't offer extensive options to customize the loading process beyond setting a timeout and interval.  However, if you need highly specialized control over how image loading is monitored, you might need to create a custom solution.  This would involve directly monitoring the `load` and `error` events on the image elements and managing the loading status yourself. This level of customization is generally unnecessary for most use cases.\n\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nWhile `waitForImages` is generally efficient, overuse or improper usage can impact performance.  Avoid calling `waitForImages` unnecessarily. Only use it when absolutely necessary, i.e., when your code depends on image dimensions or the presence of images.  Consider optimizing the `interval` option (making it larger, such as 250ms or 500ms) if performance is a major concern in your application.  However, keep in mind that a larger interval increases the time it takes to detect that the images have loaded.  Also, ensure that the `selector` you provide is specific and doesn't unnecessarily select a large portion of the DOM.\n\n### Error Handling and Debugging\n\nAlways include proper error handling using the `.catch()` method of the Promise returned by `waitForImages` or by using the `incompleteCallback` option. This allows you to gracefully handle situations where images fail to load, preventing unexpected application behavior.  If errors occur, carefully inspect the browser's developer console for detailed error messages.  These messages might indicate problems with image URLs, network connectivity, or other issues.  Using a smaller `interval` value can help pinpoint the timing of the error.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nWhile `waitForImages` doesn't directly impact accessibility, the situations where you'd use it might have accessibility implications. If you're using `waitForImages` to prevent visual glitches, ensure that you provide alternative content or mechanisms that gracefully handle the situation for users with assistive technologies.  For instance, if an image fails to load, provide alternative text or a placeholder image.  Avoid relying solely on image-dependent functionality; provide keyboard navigation and alternative ways to interact with your application for users who may not be able to see or interpret images.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **`waitForImages` never resolves:**  This often indicates that images are not loading correctly. Check the browser's developer console for network errors or issues with image URLs.  Ensure the images exist and are accessible.  Verify that the selector used in `waitForImages` correctly targets the intended image elements. If images are loading dynamically, make sure you are calling `waitForImages` *after* the images are added to the DOM.\n\n* **Timeout errors:** If the `timeout` option is set and the images take longer to load than the specified timeout, the Promise will reject.  Increase the timeout value or investigate why the images are loading slowly. Network issues, large image sizes, or slow servers could be contributing factors.\n\n* **Unexpected behavior with dynamically loaded content:** If you have images loading dynamically via JavaScript, ensure `waitForImages` is called *after* all images have been added to the DOM.  You might need to wrap your `waitForImages` call within a callback function that is triggered after the dynamic loading is complete.\n\n* **`waitForImages` is not defined:** Ensure that you have correctly installed and imported `waitForImages` into your project. Double-check your import statement and ensure there are no typos.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use the browser's developer tools:** Inspect the network tab to check for image loading errors.  The console may also provide useful error messages.\n\n* **Simplify your selector:** If you're having trouble targeting the correct images, start with a simple selector and gradually refine it.\n\n* **Log the status of your images:** Before calling `waitForImages`, use `console.log` to check that the images are present in the DOM and have the expected attributes.  You could also log the `complete` property of each image to monitor its loading state directly.\n\n* **Test with different images:** Try using a small, simple image to rule out problems related to specific image files or types.\n\n* **Reduce the `interval` option (temporarily):** A smaller interval (e.g., 10ms) provides more frequent checks but increases resource consumption. This can be useful for pinpointing when a problem arises during the loading process, although it is not recommended for production environments.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* **Does `waitForImages` support all image formats?** Yes, it generally supports all common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) automatically.\n\n* **Can I use `waitForImages` with SVG images?** Yes, `waitForImages` should work correctly with SVG images.\n\n* **What happens if an image fails to load?** The Promise will reject, and you should handle this error using `.catch()` or the `incompleteCallback` option.\n\n* **Can I cancel the `waitForImages` operation?** No, there is currently no mechanism to cancel the wait operation once it has begun.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Introduction\n\n### What is waitForImages?\n\n`waitForImages` is a utility function designed to pause execution of your JavaScript code until all images within a specified element (or the entire document) have fully loaded.
