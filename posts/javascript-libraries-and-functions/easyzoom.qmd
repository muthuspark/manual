* **Easy Integration:** Simple to install and implement using just a few lines of code.  Minimal JavaScript knowledge is required.
* **Customization Options:** Tailor the zoom experience to your needs with options for zoom intensity, animation speed, and more.
* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.
* **Cross-browser Compatibility:**  Tested and compatible with major browsers.
* **No Dependencies:** EasyZoom doesn't require any other JavaScript libraries to function.


### Getting Started: Installation and Setup

1. **Download:** Download the latest version of EasyZoom from [Insert download link here].  You'll receive a single JavaScript file (`easyzoom.min.js`).

2. **Include in your project:** Include the `easyzoom.min.js` file in your HTML document within the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="easyzoom.min.js"></script>
```

3. **Initialize EasyZoom:**  Select the image you want to make zoomable and initialize EasyZoom using JavaScript.  You'll need to provide the selector for your image.  For example, if your image has the ID "myImage", the following code would initialize EasyZoom:

```javascript
EasyZoom({
    selector: '#myImage',
    //Optional settings (See documentation for full list)
    //zoomLevel: 2,
    //speed: 200,
    //scrollZoom: false
});
```


This will enable zoom functionality on the image with the ID "myImage".  Refer to the full documentation for a complete list of available options and customization details.  [Insert link to full documentation here].


## Basic Usage

### Initializing EasyZoom

EasyZoom is initialized using a single JavaScript function call, passing a configuration object as an argument.  The most crucial setting is the `selector` property, which specifies the HTML element (typically an `<img>` tag) to apply the zoom effect to.  This selector uses standard CSS selector syntax.


```javascript
EasyZoom({
  selector: '#myImage',
});
```

This code snippet initializes EasyZoom on the element with the ID "myImage".  If you have multiple images you want to zoom, you'll need to call `EasyZoom` for each one, providing the appropriate selector.


### Basic Zoom Functionality

Once initialized, EasyZoom automatically adds zoom functionality to the specified image.  Users can zoom in and out by:

* **Mouse Wheel:** Rolling the mouse wheel over the image will zoom in or out.
* **Click and Drag:** Clicking and dragging the image will pan across a zoomed version, exploring more of the image detail.


No additional code is needed to enable these core functionalities after initialization.


### Controlling Zoom Level

While EasyZoom provides default zoom behavior, you can customize the zoom intensity and other parameters using the configuration object.  The `zoomLevel` property controls the maximum zoom level, which is a multiplier of the original image size.  A `zoomLevel` of 2 will zoom the image up to twice its original size.

```javascript
EasyZoom({
  selector: '#myImage',
  zoomLevel: 3, // Zooms up to three times the original size
});
```

You can also control the zoom speed using the `speed` option (measured in milliseconds). For example:

```javascript
EasyZoom({
  selector: '#myImage',
  speed: 500, // Sets zoom animation speed to 500ms
});
```


### Panning and Movement

EasyZoom handles panning automatically when the user clicks and drags on a zoomed image.  The panning behavior can be further customized. For instance, the `constrain` option determines if panning should be limited to within the bounds of the zoomed image.  By default, this is set to true preventing the user from panning outside of the zoomed area.

```javascript
EasyZoom({
    selector: '#myImage',
    constrain: true //Keeps panning within the image bounds (default)
});

EasyZoom({
    selector: '#myImage',
    constrain: false //Allows panning beyond the image bounds
});
```

The `easing` property allows you to control the animation's smoothness during zooming and panning.  See the API documentation for a complete list of supported easing functions.


## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Zoom Behavior

Beyond basic zoom level and speed, EasyZoom offers several options to fine-tune the zoom experience.  The `easing` property lets you choose from various animation easing functions (e.g., 'ease-in-out', 'linear').  The `scrollZoom` option enables or disables zoom control via the mouse wheel.  The `showLens` option determines whether to display a lens/magnifier (typically a smaller zoomed preview) while zooming; set to `false` to disable this feature.

```javascript
EasyZoom({
  selector: '#myImage',
  easing: 'ease-in-out',
  scrollZoom: false,
  showLens: false
});
```

The `loop` property enables continuous panning beyond the image boundaries, effectively creating a "wrap-around" effect. This is particularly useful for panoramic or 360Â° images.

```javascript
EasyZoom({
  selector: '#myImage',
  loop: true
});
```


### Setting Zoom Limits

While `zoomLevel` sets the maximum zoom, you can also set minimum zoom levels using `minZoomLevel`.  This prevents the image from zooming out too far.

```javascript
EasyZoom({
  selector: '#myImage',
  zoomLevel: 3,
  minZoomLevel: 0.5
});
```

Additionally,  `zoomInLimit` and `zoomOutLimit`  offer even more granular control over the zoom boundaries, allowing you to define exact pixel limits for the zoomed image size.  This provides more precise control in cases where the default maximum or minimum zoom may not provide optimal visual results.


### Image Preloading and Caching

For improved performance, especially with larger images, you can preload the high-resolution image that EasyZoom uses for the zoomed view. This can reduce initial load times and provide a smoother zoom experience. EasyZoom doesn't handle preloading directly but you can implement it using standard JavaScript techniques.  For example, you could load the high-resolution image using a `<img>` tag with a CSS display style of `none`, ensuring it loads without affecting the visible page layout.


### Integration with Other Libraries

EasyZoom is designed to work well with other JavaScript libraries.  There are no inherent conflicts with common frameworks or libraries, but ensure proper initialization order to avoid conflicts; generally, initialize EasyZoom after other libraries affecting the DOM have completed their work.  You should also be aware of potential styling conflicts; use appropriate CSS specificity to ensure your styles override any unintended styling by EasyZoom.


### Responsive Design and Mobile Support

EasyZoom is inherently responsive and works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.  It automatically adjusts to the image's container size.  No specific configuration is needed to ensure optimal performance on mobile devices, although you might want to consider the performance implications of high-resolution images on lower-powered mobile devices. Consider providing different image sizes for optimal performance across devices.


## API Reference

### EasyZoom Constructor

The EasyZoom constructor initializes the zoom functionality on a specified image element.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
EasyZoom(options);
```

**Parameters:**

* `options` (Object): An object containing configuration options.  See the list of available options below.

**Available Options:**

* `selector` (String):  A CSS selector targeting the image element (required).
* `zoomLevel` (Number): The maximum zoom level (default: 3).
* `minZoomLevel` (Number): The minimum zoom level (default: 1).
* `speed` (Number): Animation speed in milliseconds (default: 200).

* `scrollZoom` (Boolean): Enable zoom control via mouse wheel (default: `true`).
* `showLens` (Boolean): Display a zoom lens (default: `true`).
* `loop` (Boolean): Enable continuous panning (default: `false`).
* `imageSrc` (String): Path to the high-resolution image. If omitted, the `src` attribute of the target image will be used.  Use this option for preloading.


**Return Value:**

An EasyZoom instance.


### Methods: zoomIn, zoomOut, zoomTo, panTo, etc.

EasyZoom provides methods to programmatically control zoom and pan.  These methods are called on the EasyZoom instance returned by the constructor.

* `zoomIn()`: Zooms in one step.
* `zoomOut()`: Zooms out one step.
* `zoomTo(level)`: Zooms to a specific zoom level (a multiplier of the original image size).
* `panTo(x, y)`: Pans the zoomed image to the specified coordinates (x, y).  Coordinates are relative to the zoomed image.
* `reset()`: Resets the zoom and pan to their initial state.
* `destroy()`: Removes EasyZoom from the element, restoring the original image.


**Example:**

```javascript
const easyzoom = EasyZoom({ selector: '#myImage' });
easyzoom.zoomIn();
easyzoom.panTo(100, 50);
easyzoom.zoomTo(2);
easyzoom.reset();
easyzoom.destroy();
```


### Events: zoomStart, zoomEnd, panStart, panEnd, etc.

EasyZoom triggers custom events at various stages of the zoom and pan process.  You can listen for these events using standard JavaScript event listeners.

* `zoomStart`: Fired when a zoom operation begins.
* `zoomEnd`: Fired when a zoom operation completes.
* `panStart`: Fired when a pan operation begins.
* `panEnd`: Fired when a pan operation completes.
* `update`: Fired when the zoom level or pan position changes.


**Example:**

```javascript
const easyzoom = EasyZoom({ selector: '#myImage' });
easyzoom.on('zoomStart', () => console.log('Zoom started'));
easyzoom.on('zoomEnd', () => console.log('Zoom ended'));
```


### Properties: zoomLevel, imageSrc, etc.

EasyZoom exposes properties to access the current state of the zoom.  These properties are accessed directly on the EasyZoom instance.

* `zoomLevel`: The current zoom level.
* `x`: The current horizontal pan position.
* `y`: The current vertical pan position.
* `imageSrc`: The source URL of the high-resolution image.


**Example:**

```javascript
const easyzoom = EasyZoom({ selector: '#myImage' });
console.log(easyzoom.zoomLevel); // Get the current zoom level
console.log(easyzoom.imageSrc); //Get the current image source
```

Remember to consult the full documentation for a complete and up-to-date list of options, methods, events, and properties.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

* **EasyZoom not working:** Double-check that you've included the `easyzoom.min.js` file correctly in your HTML and that the selector in your `EasyZoom()` call accurately targets your image element. Inspect your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors.  Ensure there are no conflicting JavaScript libraries or CSS styles interfering with EasyZoom's functionality.

* **Zoom is not smooth:**  Experiment with different easing functions (e.g., 'ease-in-out', 'linear') using the `easing` option in your configuration.  A slower `speed` value might improve smoothness, but at the cost of responsiveness.

* **Image is blurry after zoom:** This often indicates that the image resolution isn't high enough to support the chosen zoom level.  Provide a higher-resolution image using the `imageSrc` option for the best zoom quality. Consider using a responsive image setup that provides appropriately sized images depending on device/screen size.

* **Panning issues:** Verify that the `constrain` option is set to your desired behaviour (true to constrain panning within the image bounds, false to allow panning beyond). Incorrect values for this option can cause unexpected panning behaviour.

* **No response to mouse wheel:** Ensure `scrollZoom` is set to `true` in your configuration and that no other JavaScript library is capturing the mouse wheel events.


### Debugging Tips

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's built-in developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Check the console for error messages, and use the debugger to step through the EasyZoom code to identify the source of problems.

* **Console Logging:** Add `console.log()` statements to your JavaScript code to track the values of variables and the execution flow of your EasyZoom initialization and usage.

* **Simplify:** If you're experiencing issues with a complex setup, try simplifying your code by removing unnecessary options or elements.  This will help pinpoint the exact cause of the problem.

* **Check for Conflicts:** If you are using other JavaScript libraries, check to ensure there are no naming conflicts or interference between those libraries and EasyZoom.

* **Test in a Minimal Environment:**  To isolate the issue, create a stripped-down HTML page with just the necessary HTML element and EasyZoom script to see if the problem persists in a simplified context.


### Browser Compatibility

EasyZoom is designed for broad browser compatibility.  However, very old or outdated browsers may have limitations.  EasyZoom has been tested on the following modern browsers:

* Google Chrome (latest versions)
* Mozilla Firefox (latest versions)
* Safari (latest versions)
* Edge (latest versions)

While older browsers might function, full functionality and optimal performance are not guaranteed.  For best results, it is recommended to target modern browsers.


## Examples

These examples assume you have already included the `easyzoom.min.js` file in your HTML.  Replace `"path/to/your/image.jpg"` with the actual path to your image file.  Remember to adjust selectors (`#myImage`, etc.) to match your HTML structure.


### Basic Image Zoom

This example demonstrates the simplest use of EasyZoom, enabling basic zoom functionality on a single image.

**HTML:**

```html
<img id="myImage" src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Zoomable Image">
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
EasyZoom({ selector: '#myImage' });
```


### Zoom with Panning

This example adds panning functionality, allowing users to explore the zoomed image beyond its initial viewport.

**HTML:** (Same as Basic Image Zoom)

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
EasyZoom({ selector: '#myImage' });
```

(No additional JavaScript is needed for panning; it's enabled by default.)


### Zoom with Custom Controls

This example shows how to add custom buttons for zoom in/out functionality using JavaScript.

**HTML:**

```html
<img id="myImage" src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Zoomable Image">
<button id="zoomIn">Zoom In</button>
<button id="zoomOut">Zoom Out</button>
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const easyzoom = EasyZoom({ selector: '#myImage' });
document.getElementById('zoomIn').addEventListener('click', () => easyzoom.zoomIn());
document.getElementById('zoomOut').addEventListener('click', () => easyzoom.zoomOut());
```


### Zoom with Thumbnails

This example uses a separate thumbnail image to trigger zoom on a larger image.

**HTML:**

```html
<img id="thumbnail" src="path/to/your/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Thumbnail">
<img id="mainImage" src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Main Image" style="display:none;">
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
EasyZoom({
    selector: '#thumbnail',
    image: '#mainImage'
});
```

(This assumes the `mainImage` is the high-resolution image displayed when zoomed.)


### Integration with Galleries

This example demonstrates a basic integration with a gallery.  For larger, more complex galleries, consider using a dedicated gallery plugin that might already have zooming capabilities.  Here's a simplified example using two images:

**HTML:**

```html
<div class="gallery">
  <img id="image1" src="path/to/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img id="image2" src="path/to/image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
</div>
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const images = document.querySelectorAll('.gallery img');
images.forEach(image => EasyZoom({ selector: image }));
```

This applies EasyZoom to each image within the gallery.  For a more sophisticated gallery, you'll need more extensive HTML and JavaScript to manage image switching and active zooming.  Consider event listeners to handle the active image and to manage the zoom state between different images.
