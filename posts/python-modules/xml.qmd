### What is XML?

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.  Unlike HTML, which defines a fixed set of tags, XML allows you to define your own custom tags, making it highly flexible and adaptable to various data structures.  This flexibility makes it ideal for representing structured data, such as configuration files, data interchange between systems, and storing data in a format that is easily parsed and processed by applications.  XML documents are structured using elements, attributes, and text content, all nested within a hierarchical tree-like structure.  Well-formedness and validity are key concepts; a well-formed XML document adheres to basic XML syntax rules, while a valid XML document also conforms to a specified Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema Definition (XSD), ensuring data consistency and integrity.

### Why use XML with Python?

Python offers robust support for processing XML, making it a popular choice for applications that need to interact with XML data.  Using Python with XML provides several advantages:

* **Data Interchange:**  XML's standardized format facilitates seamless data exchange between different systems and applications, regardless of their underlying programming languages. Python's XML libraries simplify the process of reading, writing, and manipulating this data.
* **Configuration Management:** XML's hierarchical structure lends itself well to creating flexible and easily maintainable configuration files.  Python allows you to easily parse these configurations, customizing application behavior based on the XML data.
* **Data Storage:** XML can serve as a persistent storage mechanism for structured data. Python makes it simple to read and write XML data to files, allowing you to manage and access information efficiently.
* **Extensive Libraries:** Python provides a rich ecosystem of XML processing libraries, each offering different functionalities and levels of abstraction, allowing developers to choose the tools best suited for their needs.
* **Readability and Maintainability:** XML's human-readable nature contributes to the readability and maintainability of both the XML data itself and the Python code that processes it.


### Overview of Python XML Modules

Python offers several modules for working with XML.  The most commonly used include:

* **`xml.etree.ElementTree`:** A simple and efficient API for parsing and generating XML. Ideal for most common XML processing tasks.  It provides a straightforward object-oriented approach, making it easy to navigate and manipulate the XML tree structure.

* **`xml.dom.minidom`:**  A more full-featured but potentially less efficient implementation of the Document Object Model (DOM). It's useful when you need to manipulate the entire XML document in memory as a tree structure.  It allows for more complex manipulations but can consume more memory for large XML files.

* **`xml.sax`:**  Provides an event-driven interface (SAX - Simple API for XML) for parsing XML.  This approach is more memory-efficient than DOM for very large XML files, as it processes the data sequentially instead of loading the entire document into memory.  However, it requires a different programming style and may be less intuitive for beginners.


### Choosing the Right Module

The best XML module for your Python project depends on your specific needs:

* For most common tasks involving parsing and generating XML, particularly if memory efficiency is not a primary concern, `xml.etree.ElementTree` is the recommended choice due to its simplicity and ease of use.

* If you need to extensively manipulate the entire XML document in memory and memory usage is not a significant constraint, `xml.dom.minidom` provides a more powerful API.

* If you are working with extremely large XML files where memory efficiency is paramount, or if you require incremental processing, `xml.sax`'s event-driven approach is the most appropriate option.  However, be prepared for a steeper learning curve.  Consider the trade-off between ease of use and memory consumption when making your selection.


## The `xml.etree.ElementTree` Module

### Parsing XML Documents

The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module provides the `parse()` function to parse XML documents from files or file-like objects.  The function returns a root element representing the entire XML document as a tree.  For example:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('data.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
```

Alternatively, you can parse XML from a string using `fromstring()`:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

xml_string = "<root><element>Text</element></root>"
root = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
```

Remember to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions when parsing from files.


### Creating XML Elements

You create new XML elements using the `Element()` constructor.  Elements can have text content and attributes:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

root = ET.Element("root")
element = ET.SubElement(root, "element", attrib={"attribute": "value"})
element.text = "Text content"

#To create a new element with the same tag name use
element2 = ET.Element("element")
root.append(element2)

#Or add multiple elements at once
root.extend([ET.Element("anotherElement"), ET.Element("yetAnother")])

```


### Traversing XML Trees

The XML tree can be traversed using various methods.  The `root` element provides access to child elements via indexing (`root[0]`, `root[1]`, etc.) or iteration:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# ... (parsing code from above) ...

for child in root:
    print(child.tag, child.text, child.attrib)

# Accessing specific elements using find() and findall()
element = root.find(".//element") # Finds the first 'element' anywhere in the tree
elements = root.findall(".//element") # Finds all 'element' tags
```
The `find()` method returns the first matching element, while `findall()` returns a list of all matching elements.  XPath expressions (using the `.` as the root and `//` for recursive searches) are commonly used for finding elements.


### Modifying XML Documents

You can modify existing XML elements by changing their text content, attributes, or adding/removing child elements:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# ... (parsing code from above) ...

element.text = "New text content"
element.set("new_attribute", "new_value")
root.remove(element)  # Remove element from the tree
```


### Writing XML Documents

The `tostring()` method serializes an XML element to a string, and `write()` writes it to a file:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# ... (XML creation or modification code) ...

ET.ElementTree(root).write("output.xml", encoding="UTF-8", xml_declaration=True) #xml_declaration adds <?xml version...?>

xml_string = ET.tostring(root, encoding='unicode') # tostring() returns bytes by default.  Use encoding='unicode' for a string
print(xml_string)
```
The `encoding` parameter specifies the character encoding, and `xml_declaration` adds an XML declaration at the beginning of the output.


### Namespaces in ElementTree

Namespaces are handled using prefixes and URIs.  You can create elements with namespaces, access elements using namespace-aware methods (`find`, `findall`), and serialize with correct namespace declarations:


```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

ns = {'ns': 'http://example.org/ns'}  # define a namespace
root = ET.Element("{http://example.org/ns}root")
element = ET.SubElement(root, "{http://example.org/ns}element")
element.text = "Namespace Element"

element_found = root.find(".//{http://example.org/ns}element")  #Access using namespace URI

ET.ElementTree(root).write("output_ns.xml", encoding="UTF-8", xml_declaration=True)
```

For better readability, use a namespace dictionary (`ns` above) in `find`, `findall`, and when creating elements.


### Error Handling and Exception Management

XML parsing and processing can throw exceptions.  It's crucial to handle these appropriately to prevent program crashes.  Common exceptions include:

* `xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError`: Raised when an XML parsing error occurs (e.g., malformed XML).
* `IOError` or `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when trying to access a non-existent file.

Wrap your XML processing code in `try...except` blocks:


```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

try:
    tree = ET.parse('data.xml')
    # ... XML processing code ...
except ET.ParseError as e:
    print(f"XML parsing error: {e}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
except Exception as e: # handle other unexpected errors.  Be specific where possible
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```
Always handle specific exceptions where possible for more robust error handling.


## The `xml.dom.minidom` Module

### Parsing XML Documents with minidom

The `xml.dom.minidom` module uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to represent XML documents in memory as a tree structure.  Parsing an XML file involves loading the entire document into memory.  This approach is suitable for smaller to moderately sized XML files but can be less memory-efficient for very large documents.

```python
import xml.dom.minidom

try:
    dom = xml.dom.minidom.parse("data.xml")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This code parses the XML file `data.xml`.  Error handling is crucial, as `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions are possible.  `xml.dom.minidom.parseString()` can parse XML from a string instead of a file.

### Working with DOM Nodes

The `dom` object returned by `parse()` is a `Document` node, the root of the XML tree.  It contains `documentElement`, which represents the root element of the XML.  You navigate the tree using properties like `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `nextSibling`, `parentNode`, etc., to access different nodes (elements, attributes, text nodes).

```python
root = dom.documentElement
for child in root.childNodes:
    if child.nodeType == child.ELEMENT_NODE:  # Check if it's an element node
        print(child.nodeName)
        for attribute in child.attributes.values(): #Iterate through attributes.  Could also access by name child.getAttribute("attributeName")
            print(f"  {attribute.name}: {attribute.value}")
        for grandchild in child.childNodes:
            if grandchild.nodeType == grandchild.TEXT_NODE: #check if it's text
                print(f"  Text: {grandchild.nodeValue}")


```

The `nodeType` attribute distinguishes between different node types.  Element nodes have a `nodeName` (the element's tag name) and `attributes` (a `NamedNodeMap`).


### Creating XML Documents with minidom

To create XML documents, you start by creating a `Document` object and then add elements, attributes, and text nodes:

```python
import xml.dom.minidom

doc = xml.dom.minidom.Document()
root = doc.createElement("root")
doc.appendChild(root)

element = doc.createElement("element")
element.setAttribute("attribute", "value")
element.appendChild(doc.createTextNode("Text content"))
root.appendChild(element)
```

Use `doc.createElement()` to create elements, `doc.createTextNode()` for text nodes, and `setAttribute()` for attributes.  Remember to append nodes to their parents using `appendChild()`.


### Modifying XML Documents with minidom

Modifying an existing XML document involves changing the text content of nodes, adding or removing nodes, or changing attributes:

```python
# ... (assuming 'dom' is already parsed from above) ...

element = dom.documentElement.firstChild #access the first child (assuming it's the element we want to modify)
element.attributes.getNamedItem("attribute").nodeValue = "new_value" #Modify an attribute
element.firstChild.nodeValue = "Modified text content" # Modify text content
newElement = dom.createElement("newElement")
element.appendChild(newElement) #Add a new child
```

Use `setAttribute()` to modify attributes and directly change `nodeValue` for text nodes.  Remember that removing a node requires using `removeChild()`.


### Serializing XML Documents

Once you've created or modified an XML document, you need to serialize it to a string or file.  `toxml()` serializes the document to a string:

```python
xml_string = dom.toxml()
print(xml_string)

#To write to a file:
with open("output.xml", "w") as f:
    dom.writexml(f, addindent="  ", newl="\n", encoding="utf-8") #addindent and newl control formatting

```

The `writexml()` method writes to a file, allowing you to specify indentation (`addindent`) and newline characters (`newl`) for better formatting.


### Namespaces in minidom

minidom supports namespaces. You handle them by using prefixes in element and attribute names and storing a mapping of prefixes to namespace URIs:

```python
import xml.dom.minidom

doc = xml.dom.minidom.Document()
ns = "http://example.org/ns"
root = doc.createElementNS(ns,"ns:root")
element = doc.createElementNS(ns,"ns:element")
element.setAttributeNS(ns,"ns:attribute", "value")
root.appendChild(element)
doc.appendChild(root)
doc.writexml(open('output_ns.xml', 'w'))
```

Use `createElementNS()` and `setAttributeNS()` for namespace-aware element and attribute creation, providing the namespace URI as the first argument.  Remember to include the prefix in the element and attribute names.  Proper serialization of the XML with namespaces is automatically handled by `writexml()`.  However, the output might not include the XML declaration (<?xml ... ?>) depending on parameters passed to `writexml()`.


## The `xml.sax` Module

### Introduction to SAX Parsing

The `xml.sax` module implements the Simple API for XML (SAX), an event-driven approach to XML parsing.  Unlike DOM, which loads the entire XML document into memory, SAX parses the XML incrementally, processing each element as it encounters it.  This makes SAX very memory-efficient for large XML files, but it requires a different programming style.  SAX works by defining a handler class that implements methods corresponding to different XML events (start element, end element, characters, etc.).  The parser calls these methods as it processes the XML data.


### Creating a SAX Handler

A SAX handler is a class that inherits from `xml.sax.ContentHandler` and overrides methods like `startElement()`, `endElement()`, `characters()`, etc. These methods are called by the parser at specific points in the XML document processing.

```python
import xml.sax

class MyHandler(xml.sax.ContentHandler):
    def __init__(self):
        self.CurrentData = ""
        self.element_data = {}

    def startElement(self, name, attrs):
        self.CurrentData = name
        #print("Start Element:", name)
        #for at in attrs.items():
        #    print("   attr:", at[0], "=", at[1])

    def endElement(self, name):
        #print("End Element:", name)
        if name in self.element_data:
            self.element_data[name] += 1
        else:
            self.element_data[name] = 1
        self.CurrentData = ""

    def characters(self, content):
        #print("Characters:", content)
        if self.CurrentData != "":
            if self.CurrentData in self.element_data:
                self.element_data[self.CurrentData] += content
            else:
                self.element_data[self.CurrentData] = content

```

This example defines a handler that counts the occurrences of elements and accumulates their text content.


### Parsing XML with SAX

To use a SAX handler, create an instance of the handler, create a parser using `xml.sax.make_parser()`, and set the handler using `parser.setContentHandler()`.  Then parse the XML file or string:


```python
import xml.sax

# ... (MyHandler class definition from above) ...

parser = xml.sax.make_parser()
handler = MyHandler()
parser.setContentHandler(handler)

try:
    parser.parse("data.xml")
    print(handler.element_data)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during parsing: {e}")
```

This code parses `data.xml` using the `MyHandler`.  The handler's `element_data` dictionary will then contain the processed data.  Error handling is critical to catch file not found and other potential exceptions during parsing.


### Advantages and Disadvantages of SAX Parsing

**Advantages:**

* **Memory Efficiency:**  SAX is ideal for very large XML files because it doesn't load the entire document into memory.  It processes the data incrementally.
* **Speed:**  Because it processes the XML sequentially without the overhead of building a complete in-memory tree, SAX can be faster than DOM for large files.
* **Streaming:** SAX can process XML from a stream, making it suitable for situations where the entire XML document isn't available at once (e.g., network streams).


**Disadvantages:**

* **Complexity:** SAX requires more complex code compared to DOM because you need to explicitly handle each event.
* **No Random Access:** You can't directly access elements randomly. You must process the XML sequentially.  If you need to jump around the XML tree, you would need to maintain your own data structures to index elements as you parse.
* **Debugging:** Debugging can be more challenging with SAX due to the event-driven nature and lack of a complete in-memory representation.  You need to carefully track the state of the parser and the handler.


Choosing between SAX and DOM depends on the size of the XML files, the processing requirements, and the developer's preference and experience.  For smaller XML files, DOM's simplicity might be preferred.  For very large files where memory efficiency is crucial, SAX is the better choice, despite its increased complexity.


## Advanced XML Processing Techniques

### Working with XML Schemas (XSD)

XML Schema Definition (XSD) is a language for defining the structure and content of XML documents.  Using XSDs allows you to define data types, constraints, and element relationships, ensuring data consistency and validity.  While Python's built-in XML modules don't directly support XSD validation, external libraries like `lxml` provide this functionality.  `lxml` offers a more robust and feature-rich XML processing experience compared to the standard library modules.

```python
from lxml import etree

schema = etree.XMLSchema(file="schema.xsd")  # Load the XSD file

try:
    doc = etree.parse("data.xml")
    schema.assertValid(doc)  # Validate the XML document against the schema
    print("XML document is valid.")
except etree.XMLSyntaxError as e:
    print(f"XML Syntax Error: {e}")
except etree.XMLSchemaValidateError as e:
    print(f"XML Validation Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

This example uses `lxml` to load an XSD file and validate an XML document against it.  Appropriate exception handling is crucial to manage potential errors during schema loading and validation.


### XML Validation

Validating XML ensures that a document conforms to a predefined schema or DTD.  This is vital for data integrity and interoperability.  Beyond `lxml`, other libraries such as `xmlschema` provide comprehensive XSD validation.  Validation helps catch errors early in the processing pipeline and prevents data corruption or unexpected behavior in applications that consume the XML.  The choice of validation method (against an XSD or a DTD) depends on the schema language used to define the XML structure.


### XPath and XQuery in Python

XPath is a query language for selecting nodes in an XML document.  XQuery is a more powerful language for querying and transforming XML data.  `lxml` provides excellent support for both XPath and XQuery.

```python
from lxml import etree

tree = etree.parse("data.xml")

# XPath example:
elements = tree.xpath("//element[@attribute='value']")  # Select all 'element' nodes with attribute 'attribute' equal to 'value'

# XQuery example (requires more advanced setup, often involving a database)
# ... (code for XQuery processing using lxml or another library) ...


```


### Processing Large XML Files Efficiently

Processing extremely large XML files requires strategies to avoid memory exhaustion.  SAX parsing (as discussed earlier) is highly effective.  Streaming XML parsers that process data chunk by chunk are also beneficial.  Consider using iterators to process XML elements one at a time, instead of loading everything into memory at once.  Libraries like `lxml` offer optimized parsing techniques for large files, and techniques like iterative processing through the tree can significantly reduce memory footprint.


### Handling XML Namespaces

Namespaces prevent naming collisions in XML documents.  Proper namespace handling is crucial for correctly interpreting and processing XML data.  Use namespace prefixes and URIs correctly when parsing, creating, and modifying XML documents (as illustrated in previous sections).   The use of namespace dictionaries with libraries like `lxml` significantly improves code readability and reduces the risk of errors related to namespaces.  Pay close attention to namespace declarations when serializing XML documents to ensure that generated XML includes proper namespace information.

### XML Security Considerations

XML documents should not be processed without considering security implications.  Be cautious about processing untrusted XML data, as malicious XML (e.g., containing denial-of-service attacks or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities) can cause significant problems.  Always validate XML documents against a schema to ensure they conform to the expected structure, and carefully sanitize any user-supplied XML data before processing.  Use appropriate libraries that offer robust security features and handle potential vulnerabilities.  External entity expansion attacks (XXE) are a particular concern; ensure that parsers are configured to disable or restrict external entity processing.  Consider using XML security libraries or frameworks to harden your XML processing pipelines against various attacks.


## Example Applications and Use Cases

### Parsing Configuration Files

XML is frequently used for configuration files due to its human-readable structure and hierarchical nature.  Python's XML libraries make it easy to parse configuration settings.

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse("config.xml")
root = tree.getroot()

database_host = root.find("database/host").text
database_port = int(root.find("database/port").text)
# ... process other configuration settings ...

print(f"Database host: {database_host}, Port: {database_port}")
```

This example shows how to extract database configuration settings from an XML file.  Error handling (e.g., checking if elements exist before accessing their text) is crucial in real-world applications.


### Working with Web Services

Many web services use XML for data exchange (e.g., SOAP).  Python's XML libraries are used to send and receive XML data from web services.  Libraries like `requests` are commonly used for HTTP communication, along with XML processing libraries to handle the XML payload.

```python
import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

response = requests.get("http://example.com/webservice")
root = ET.fromstring(response.content)
# ... process the XML response ...
```

This demonstrates a basic interaction with a web service returning XML data.  More complex scenarios might involve sending XML requests and handling different HTTP status codes.


### Data Serialization and Deserialization

XML is used to serialize data structures into a persistent format and deserialize them back into Python objects.  This is useful for storing data, exchanging data between systems, or persisting application state.

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
data = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

root = ET.Element("person")
ET.SubElement(root, "name").text = data["name"]
ET.SubElement(root, "age").text = str(data["age"])
ET.SubElement(root, "city").text = data["city"]

tree = ET.ElementTree(root)
tree.write("person.xml")

#Deserialization
tree = ET.parse("person.xml")
root = tree.getroot()
loaded_data = {
    "name": root.find("name").text,
    "age": int(root.find("age").text),
    "city": root.find("city").text
}
print(loaded_data)
```

This shows serialization to and deserialization from an XML file.


### Generating XML Reports

XML is well-suited for generating reports because it allows for structured data representation.  Python's XML libraries can create XML documents dynamically based on data.

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

data = [
    {"name": "Product A", "price": 10.99},
    {"name": "Product B", "price": 25.50},
]

root = ET.Element("products")
for item in data:
    product = ET.SubElement(root, "product")
    ET.SubElement(product, "name").text = item["name"]
    ET.SubElement(product, "price").text = str(item["price"])

tree = ET.ElementTree(root)
tree.write("report.xml")

```

This example generates a simple product report in XML format.


### Interacting with Databases using XML

XML can be used to exchange data with databases.  Databases can export data to XML format, and Python can parse this XML and process the data.  Similarly, Python can generate XML documents containing data to be inserted or updated in the database.  Libraries specific to database interaction (e.g., database connectors for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) are used in conjunction with XML processing libraries.  This often involves mapping database table rows or other data structures to XML elements.  Using a database's native XML support (if available) can be more efficient than manually converting data to and from XML.


## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Errors and Solutions

Several common errors arise during XML processing in Python:

* **`xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError`:** This indicates a problem with the XML document's structure, such as malformed tags, missing closing tags, or invalid characters. Carefully check the XML for syntax errors.  Use an XML validator (online or within your IDE) to identify specific issues.

* **`FileNotFoundError`:**  This occurs when attempting to parse an XML file that doesn't exist.  Ensure the correct file path is used.

* **`AttributeError`:**  This might occur if you try to access an attribute or element that doesn't exist in the XML tree. Use methods like `.find()` or `.get()` with appropriate error handling to check for the existence of elements before accessing their properties.

* **Namespace issues:** Incorrect handling of namespaces can lead to errors when selecting or modifying elements. Carefully review the namespace URIs and prefixes used in your XML and code. Use namespace-aware functions provided by the XML libraries.

* **Memory Errors:** Processing large XML files with DOM-based parsers can lead to memory errors. Use SAX parsing or other memory-efficient techniques for large files.


### Debugging XML Processing Code

Debugging XML processing code often involves inspecting the XML structure and the state of your Python objects.

* **Print statements:** Strategically placed `print()` statements can show the contents of XML elements, attributes, and Python variables at different points in the processing.  This helps track data flow and identify errors.

* **Logging:**  Use Python's logging module for more structured logging of events and errors during XML processing. This allows for easier debugging in larger applications.

* **Debuggers:** Use a Python debugger (e.g., pdb) to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and understand the execution flow.

* **XML validators:** Use online validators or validators integrated into your IDE to verify the well-formedness and validity of XML documents.  This helps determine if errors originate in your code or the XML itself.

* **Inspecting XML structures:** If the XML is complex, tools like XML editors or online viewers can help visualize the document's structure and identify problematic areas visually.



### Performance Optimization Techniques

For efficient XML processing:

* **SAX Parsing:** Use SAX parsing for large XML files to avoid loading the entire document into memory.

* **Iterators:** Iterate through XML elements one at a time instead of loading all elements into a list at once.

* **Efficient Data Structures:** Use appropriate data structures (e.g., dictionaries) to store and access XML data efficiently.

* **Optimized Libraries:** Employ well-optimized libraries like `lxml`.  `lxml` often offers significantly faster performance compared to the standard library's XML modules.

* **Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.


### Security Best Practices

* **Input Validation:** Validate all XML input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XXE attacks).  Never trust user-provided XML without proper validation.

* **External Entity Expansion:** Disable or restrict external entity expansion in your XML parser to mitigate XXE vulnerabilities.

* **Schema Validation:** Validate XML documents against a schema (XSD or DTD) to ensure data integrity and conformity to expected structure.

* **Secure Libraries:** Use secure and well-maintained libraries for XML processing.

* **Sanitization:** Sanitize XML data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.


### Coding Style Guidelines

* **Consistency:** Follow a consistent coding style (e.g., PEP 8).

* **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for variables and functions.

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions and handle them gracefully.

* **Comments:** Add clear comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.

* **Modularity:** Break down complex XML processing tasks into smaller, reusable functions or modules to improve code organization and maintainability.

* **Documentation:** Document your XML processing code thoroughly, including descriptions of the XML structure, functions, and error handling.  Use docstrings to describe the purpose and usage of functions and modules.
