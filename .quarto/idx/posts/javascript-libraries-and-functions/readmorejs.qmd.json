It's designed to improve the user experience by preventing overly long text blocks from disrupting page layout, while still providing easy access to the complete information.  The library handles the expansion and contraction of the text smoothly, providing a clean and intuitive interaction.\n\n### Why use Readmore.js?\n\n* **Improved User Experience:** Prevents long text blocks from overwhelming users and improves page readability.\n* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal display on various devices.\n* **Lightweight and Efficient:** Minimal impact on page load time due to its small file size.\n* **Easy to Implement:** Simple integration with minimal code required.\n* **Customizable:** Offers options to customize the appearance and behavior of the \"Read More\" functionality.\n\n### Installation\n\nReadmore.js can be easily installed using several methods:\n\n**1. Download:** Download the `readmore.min.js` file from the project's repository and include it in your project's HTML file.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/readmore.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**2. CDN:** Include the library using a CDN link in your HTML file. https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Readmore.js/2.0.2\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://example.com/readmore.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**3. npm (if applicable):**  If the library is available via npm, install it using:\n\n```bash\nnpm install readmore.js\n```\n\nThen, import it into your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\nimport Readmore from 'readmore.js';\n```\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nTo use Readmore.js, simply include the JavaScript file (as described in the Installation section) and add the `data-readmore` attribute to the element containing the text you want to truncate.  The library will automatically detect and process elements with this attribute.\n\n\n```html\n<p data-readmore>This is a very long paragraph of text that needs to be truncated using Readmore.js.  It will continue on and on and on, demonstrating the functionality of the library.  This is a test paragraph to show how it works.  This is the end of the long paragraph.</p>\n\n<script>\n  //If required any initialization, then add it here. For example:\n  //readmore.init(); \n</script>\n```\n\nThat's it!  Readmore.js will automatically truncate the text within the `<p>` element and add a \"Read More\" link.  Clicking the link will reveal the full text, and another link will appear allowing the user to collapse the text again.  No additional JavaScript code is needed for the most basic functionality.  Further customization options are available (see the Advanced Usage section –  which would be added in a fuller manual).\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### The `readmore` function\n\nReadmore.js primarily utilizes a single core function, implicitly called when elements with the `data-readmore` attribute are detected.  This function analyzes the text content of the targeted element, truncates it based on various factors (including options, see below), and inserts the necessary HTML for the \"Read More\" functionality.  While there isn't an explicitly exposed `readmore` function for direct programmatic invocation in the basic usage, understanding its underlying behavior is crucial for advanced implementation.\n\n\nThe implicit function performs the following steps:\n\n1. **Text Measurement:** Determines the height of the element's content before truncation.\n2. **Truncation:** Shortens the text to a specified length (or height) and adds an ellipsis (...) to indicate truncation.\n3. **HTML Insertion:** Inserts a \"Read More\" link after the truncated text, along with necessary HTML for expanding and collapsing the content.  The inserted HTML dynamically manages the visibility of the full text.\n4. **Event Handling:** Attaches event listeners to the \"Read More\" and \"Read Less\" links, controlling the expansion and contraction of the text.\n\n\n### Options and Customization\n\nReadmore.js offers several options for customization. These are typically set via data attributes on the target element, allowing for fine-grained control over the library's behavior.  Further customization may be achieved through CSS styling.\n\n* **`data-readmore-height`:** Specifies the maximum height of the truncated text in pixels. If this attribute is used, the text will be truncated when it exceeds this height, regardless of the number of characters.\n\n* **`data-readmore-speed`:** Controls the animation speed of the text expansion and contraction (in milliseconds). A lower value results in faster animations.  Default is typically 200ms.\n\n* **`data-readmore-more`:** Customize the text of the \"Read More\" link.\n\n* **`data-readmore-less`:** Customize the text of the \"Read Less\" link.\n\n* **`data-readmore-after`:**  Allows you to specify the content that should appear *after* the truncated text but *before* the \"Read More\" link. Useful for adding icons or other elements.\n\nExample of using options:\n\n```html\n<p data-readmore data-readmore-height=\"100\" data-readmore-speed=\"500\" data-readmore-more=\"Show More...\" data-readmore-less=\"Show Less...\">This is a very long paragraph...</p>\n```\n\n### Speed and Performance\n\nReadmore.js is designed to be lightweight and efficient.  Its performance is primarily influenced by the length of the text being processed and the number of Readmore instances on the page.  For very large amounts of text, using `data-readmore-height` to control truncation by height can be significantly more efficient than truncating by character count.  This is because calculating height involves fewer computations compared to determining the number of characters that will fit in a given height, especially for text with varying font sizes and line heights.\n\nMinimizing the number of Readmore instances on a single page through careful selection of target elements also contributes to better performance.\n\n### Handling Multiple Readmore Instances\n\nReadmore.js automatically handles multiple instances on a single page.  Each element with the `data-readmore` attribute is processed independently.  There is no need for special handling or initialization for multiple instances; the library automatically identifies and processes each element appropriately.  Note that performance may be affected by a very large number of instances, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing the Readmore Button\n\nWhile Readmore.js provides options to customize the \"Read More\" and \"Read Less\" link text, you might want more control over the button's visual appearance. This can be achieved by directly manipulating the DOM after the library has processed the element, or, preferably, by using CSS to style the generated elements.  Readmore.js adds specific CSS classes to the generated elements which allow for targeted styling.  For example, the \"Read More\" link will have a class such as `readmore-link` (the exact class name might vary depending on the library version).   Similarly, the container for the expandable content will have a class to identify it. Consult the library's documentation or source code for the exact class names used.\n\nHere's an example using CSS:\n\n```css\n.readmore-link {\n  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green */\n  border: none;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n.readmore-link:hover{\n  background-color: #3e8e41;\n}\n.readmore-content{ /*This class may vary. Check the source code */\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to replace `.readmore-link` and `.readmore-content` with the actual class names used by the library.\n\n\n### Using Readmore with Different HTML Structures\n\nWhile the basic usage examples show Readmore.js working with `<p>` tags, it's flexible enough to work with various HTML structures. The `data-readmore` attribute can be applied to any element containing text. However, ensure that the element's CSS allows for text wrapping and potentially adjusts its height dynamically.  Complex layouts might require more tailored CSS styling to ensure proper rendering and behavior.\n\n\nExample using a `<div>`:\n\n```html\n<div data-readmore>This is a long piece of text within a div element.</div>\n```\n\n\n### Dynamic Content Updates\n\nIf the content of the element with the `data-readmore` attribute changes dynamically (e.g., through AJAX or JavaScript updates), you need to re-initialize Readmore.js to re-process the updated content.   This ensures the truncation and \"Read More\" functionality are correctly applied to the new text.  A simple way to achieve this is to call the library's initialization function (if one exists) after updating the content, or by removing and re-adding the `data-readmore` attribute.  The exact method depends on the specific library implementation.\n\n\n### Integration with Other Javascript Libraries\n\nIntegrating Readmore.js with other JavaScript libraries generally shouldn't pose issues.  However, ensure that any conflicts between event handlers or DOM manipulation are resolved.  If there's a conflict, adjust the order of script inclusion or use event delegation techniques to ensure that events are handled correctly.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nEnsure sufficient contrast between the text and background for users with visual impairments.  Use appropriate ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies.  Specifically, consider adding ARIA attributes to the \"Read More\" and \"Read Less\" links and the container element for the expanded content.  For example, you could use `aria-expanded` on the container and descriptive `aria-label` attributes on the links.  The specific ARIA attributes to use will depend on how the library structures its HTML.  Always test with assistive technologies to ensure proper accessibility.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Readmore.js not working:** Ensure that the `readmore.min.js` (or equivalent) file is correctly included in your HTML file and that the path is accurate. Check your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.  Also verify that the `data-readmore` attribute is correctly applied to the target element.\n\n* **Text not truncating:** Double-check that the element with the `data-readmore` attribute contains sufficient text to require truncation.  Make sure that your CSS isn't overriding the library's styling and preventing the truncation from being visually apparent.  Inspect the element using your browser's developer tools to see if the text has actually been truncated but is not displayed correctly due to CSS issues.\n\n* **Incorrect truncation height:** If using `data-readmore-height`, verify that the specified height is appropriate for the font size and line height of your text. Experiment with different height values to find the optimal setting.\n\n* **Animation issues:** If the expansion/contraction animation is not working correctly, inspect your CSS for any conflicting styles. The animation speed (`data-readmore-speed`) can be adjusted to troubleshoot issues, and check that the library's CSS is not overridden.\n\n\n* **Multiple instances behaving unexpectedly:** Although Readmore.js usually handles multiple instances independently, ensure no conflicts exist in your code or CSS.  If there are conflicts, consider carefully reviewing the code that manipulates the elements to ensure the library has the opportunity to operate.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML and CSS of your elements.  This will help identify any style conflicts or problems with the library's generated HTML.  The console will also show any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **JavaScript Console:** Check the JavaScript console for any errors that might indicate problems with the library's loading or execution.\n\n* **Simplify your HTML:** To isolate the problem, create a minimal HTML example with only the necessary elements and the Readmore.js script. This helps to rule out issues caused by other parts of your code.\n\n\n* **Check for CSS conflicts:** If the visual output of Readmore.js is unexpected, carefully examine your CSS for rules that might be overriding the library's styles.  Use your browser's developer tools to check which styles are applied to the Readmore elements.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nReadmore.js, being a relatively simple library, may not include extensive built-in error handling. However, good coding practices suggest that you should handle potential issues in your own code.  For instance, you might want to gracefully degrade the experience if the library fails to load or if an unexpected error occurs during execution. This could involve providing alternative text or displaying a message to the user instead of letting the page render incorrectly.\n\nError handling can be achieved by adding a try-catch block around the initialization code or any dynamic update routines related to the library. The catch block could log the error to the console and display a user-friendly message indicating that there was a problem.  If using a module bundler, ensure that you are correctly importing and using the library to avoid any import-related issues.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the API of Readmore.js, assuming a hypothetical structure for illustrative purposes.  The actual API might differ depending on the library's implementation.  Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.\n\n### `readmore()` Function Parameters\n\nWhile Readmore.js might not have a directly callable `readmore()` function in its basic usage (the functionality is invoked implicitly through the `data-readmore` attribute), this section describes a hypothetical API where a `readmore()` function is available for advanced programmatic control.\n\n\nThe hypothetical `readmore()` function could accept the following parameters:\n\n\n* **`element` (required):**  A DOM element (or a CSS selector string) representing the element containing the text to be truncated.  This is the element that would normally have the `data-readmore` attribute.\n\n* **`options` (optional):** An object containing configuration options (detailed in the next section).  If not provided, the library will use default values.\n\nExample (Hypothetical):\n\n```javascript\nconst myParagraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\nreadmore(myParagraph, { height: 100, speed: 300, moreText: 'Show more details' });\n\n// or using a selector\nreadmore('#anotherParagraph', {height:150});\n```\n\n### Options Object Details\n\nThe `options` object (used with the hypothetical `readmore()` function) allows for fine-grained control over the library's behavior.  The following properties are assumed, but you should check the actual library documentation:\n\n\n* **`height` (number, optional):**  The maximum height of the truncated text in pixels.  If specified, truncation is based on height rather than character count.  Default value (if any) would be specified in the library's documentation.\n\n* **`speed` (number, optional):** The animation speed (in milliseconds) for expanding/collapsing the text. Default value would be specified in the library documentation.\n\n* **`moreText` (string, optional):** The text to display on the \"Read More\" link.  Default would be defined in the library documentation.\n\n* **`lessText` (string, optional):** The text to display on the \"Read Less\" link. Default would be defined in the library documentation.\n\n* **`afterText` (string, optional):**  HTML content that will be inserted after the truncated text and before the \"Read More\" link.\n\n\n### Events\n\nReadmore.js may not trigger explicit custom events in a basic implementation.  However, this section describes potential events that a more advanced version of the library *could* offer for better integration:\n\n\n* **`readmore.expanded`:** This event is triggered when the full text is revealed after clicking \"Read More\". The event would be dispatched on the target element.\n\n* **`readmore.collapsed`:** This event is triggered when the text is collapsed again after clicking \"Read Less\". The event is dispatched on the target element.\n\n\nExample (Hypothetical – Event handling would depend on the library's implementation):\n\n```javascript\nconst myParagraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n\nmyParagraph.addEventListener('readmore.expanded', () => {\n  console.log('Text expanded!');\n});\n\nmyParagraph.addEventListener('readmore.collapsed', () => {\n  console.log('Text collapsed!');\n});\n\nreadmore(myParagraph); // Initialize Readmore.js\n```\n\nRemember that these APIs are hypothetical.  Consult the actual Readmore.js documentation for details about its real functionality.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples assume a hypothetical `readmore()` function and API as described in the previous section.  Refer to the actual library documentation for the correct usage.\n\n### Simple Example\n\nThis example shows the most basic usage of Readmore.js, truncating a paragraph of text and adding a \"Read More\" link.  The library would handle the truncation and the creation of the \"Read More\" functionality.\n\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">This is a long paragraph of text that needs to be truncated.  It will continue on and on and on, demonstrating the functionality of the library. This is a test paragraph to show how it works. This is the end of the long paragraph.</p>\n\n<script>\n  // Assuming a readmore() function exists as described in the API reference\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  readmore(paragraph); \n</script>\n```\n\n### Advanced Example\n\nThis example demonstrates the use of options to customize the appearance and behavior of Readmore.js.\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">This is another long paragraph of text. This example showcases the use of options to customize the Readmore behavior.</p>\n\n<script>\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  readmore(paragraph, {\n    height: 150,\n    speed: 500,\n    moreText: 'Show Details',\n    lessText: 'Hide Details',\n    afterText: '<span class=\"readmore-icon\">&#8744;</span>' //Example custom icon. Add required CSS\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nRemember to add the appropriate CSS for `.readmore-icon`  to style the icon correctly.\n\n\n### Example with Custom Styling\n\nThis example demonstrates adding custom CSS to style the Readmore elements.\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">This paragraph demonstrates custom styling with Readmore.js</p>\n\n<style>\n  .readmore-link { /* Adjust class name if necessary */\n    color: #007bff; /* Blue link color */\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  .readmore-truncated { /* Adjust class name if necessary */\n    font-style: italic;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<script>\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  readmore(paragraph);\n</script>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `.readmore-link` and `.readmore-truncated` with actual class names used by the library.\n\n\n### Example with Dynamic Content\n\nThis example showcases how to update the Readmore functionality when the content of the element changes dynamically. This example assumes a hypothetical `readmore()` function and requires a mechanism for updating the text content of `myParagraph`.\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">Initial text.</p>\n\n<button id=\"updateButton\">Update Text</button>\n\n<script>\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  const button = document.getElementById('updateButton');\n\n  readmore(paragraph);\n\n  button.addEventListener('click', () => {\n    const newText = 'This is the updated text.  It is now much longer than before.';\n    paragraph.textContent = newText;\n    //Re-initialize Readmore.js to handle the updated content\n    readmore(paragraph); // Re-initialize. Method may vary depending on library implementation\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nRemember that the method for re-initializing Readmore.js might differ based on the library's actual implementation.  The above example only presents a conceptual approach.  Check the library documentation for the correct method.  Always test thoroughly to ensure proper functionality with dynamic updates.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Introduction\n\n### What is Readmore.js?\n\nReadmore.js is a lightweight, easy-to-use JavaScript library that allows you to truncate long blocks of text and add a \"Read More\" link to reveal the full content.

Clicking the link will reveal the full text, and another link will appear allowing the user to collapse the text again.  No additional JavaScript code is needed for the most basic functionality.  Further customization options are available (see the Advanced Usage section –  which would be added in a fuller manual).\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### The `readmore` function\n\nReadmore.js primarily utilizes a single core function, implicitly called when elements with the `data-readmore` attribute are detected.  This function analyzes the text content of the targeted element, truncates it based on various factors (including options, see below), and inserts the necessary HTML for the \"Read More\" functionality.

The inserted HTML dynamically manages the visibility of the full text.\n4. **Event Handling:** Attaches event listeners to the \"Read More\" and \"Read Less\" links, controlling the expansion and contraction of the text.\n\n\n### Options and Customization\n\nReadmore.js offers several options for customization. These are typically set via data attributes on the target element, allowing for fine-grained control over the library's behavior.  Further customization may be achieved through CSS styling.\n\n* **`data-readmore-height`:** Specifies the maximum height of the truncated text in pixels. If this attribute is used, the text will be truncated when it exceeds this height, regardless of the number of characters.\n\n* **`data-readmore-speed`:** Controls the animation speed of the text expansion and contraction (in milliseconds). A lower value results in faster animations.  Default is typically 200ms.\n\n* **`data-readmore-more`:** Customize the text of the \"Read More\" link.\n\n* **`data-readmore-less`:** Customize the text of the \"Read Less\" link.\n\n* **`data-readmore-after`:**  Allows you to specify the content that should appear *after* the truncated text but *before* the \"Read More\" link. Useful for adding icons or other elements.\n\nExample of using options:\n\n```html\n<p data-readmore data-readmore-height=\"100\" data-readmore-speed=\"500\" data-readmore-more=\"Show More...\" data-readmore-less=\"Show Less...\">This is a very long paragraph...</p>\n```\n\n### Speed and Performance\n\nReadmore.js is designed to be lightweight and efficient.  Its performance is primarily influenced by the length of the text being processed and the number of Readmore instances on the page.  For very large amounts of text, using `data-readmore-height` to control truncation by height can be significantly more efficient than truncating by character count.  This is because calculating height involves fewer computations compared to determining the number of characters that will fit in a given height, especially for text with varying font sizes and line heights.\n\nMinimizing the number of Readmore instances on a single page through careful selection of target elements also contributes to better performance.\n\n### Handling Multiple Readmore Instances\n\nReadmore.js automatically handles multiple instances on a single page.  Each element with the `data-readmore` attribute is processed independently.  There is no need for special handling or initialization for multiple instances; the library automatically identifies and processes each element appropriately.  Note that performance may be affected by a very large number of instances, as discussed in the previous section.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing the Readmore Button\n\nWhile Readmore.js provides options to customize the \"Read More\" and \"Read Less\" link text, you might want more control over the button's visual appearance. This can be achieved by directly manipulating the DOM after the library has processed the element, or, preferably, by using CSS to style the generated elements.  Readmore.js adds specific CSS classes to the generated elements which allow for targeted styling.  For example, the \"Read More\" link will have a class such as `readmore-link` (the exact class name might vary depending on the library version).   Similarly, the container for the expandable content will have a class to identify it. Consult the library's documentation or source code for the exact class names used.\n\nHere's an example using CSS:\n\n```css\n.readmore-link {\n  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green */\n  border: none;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n.readmore-link:hover{\n  background-color: #3e8e41;\n}\n.readmore-content{ /*This class may vary. Check the source code */\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to replace `.readmore-link` and `.readmore-content` with the actual class names used by the library.\n\n\n### Using Readmore with Different HTML Structures\n\nWhile the basic usage examples show Readmore.js working with `<p>` tags, it's flexible enough to work with various HTML structures. The `data-readmore` attribute can be applied to any element containing text. However, ensure that the element's CSS allows for text wrapping and potentially adjusts its height dynamically.  Complex layouts might require more tailored CSS styling to ensure proper rendering and behavior.\n\n\nExample using a `<div>`:\n\n```html\n<div data-readmore>This is a long piece of text within a div element.</div>\n```\n\n\n### Dynamic Content Updates\n\nIf the content of the element with the `data-readmore` attribute changes dynamically (e.g., through AJAX or JavaScript updates), you need to re-initialize Readmore.js to re-process the updated content.   This ensures the truncation and \"Read More\" functionality are correctly applied to the new text.  A simple way to achieve this is to call the library's initialization function (if one exists) after updating the content, or by removing and re-adding the `data-readmore` attribute.  The exact method depends on the specific library implementation.\n\n\n### Integration with Other Javascript Libraries\n\nIntegrating Readmore.js with other JavaScript libraries generally shouldn't pose issues.  However, ensure that any conflicts between event handlers or DOM manipulation are resolved.  If there's a conflict, adjust the order of script inclusion or use event delegation techniques to ensure that events are handled correctly.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nEnsure sufficient contrast between the text and background for users with visual impairments.  Use appropriate ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies.  Specifically, consider adding ARIA attributes to the \"Read More\" and \"Read Less\" links and the container element for the expanded content.  For example, you could use `aria-expanded` on the container and descriptive `aria-label` attributes on the links.  The specific ARIA attributes to use will depend on how the library structures its HTML.  Always test with assistive technologies to ensure proper accessibility.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n* **Readmore.js not working:** Ensure that the `readmore.min.js` (or equivalent) file is correctly included in your HTML file and that the path is accurate. Check your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.  Also verify that the `data-readmore` attribute is correctly applied to the target element.\n\n* **Text not truncating:** Double-check that the element with the `data-readmore` attribute contains sufficient text to require truncation.  Make sure that your CSS isn't overriding the library's styling and preventing the truncation from being visually apparent.

The console will also show any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **JavaScript Console:** Check the JavaScript console for any errors that might indicate problems with the library's loading or execution.\n\n* **Simplify your HTML:** To isolate the problem, create a minimal HTML example with only the necessary elements and the Readmore.js script. This helps to rule out issues caused by other parts of your code.\n\n\n* **Check for CSS conflicts:** If the visual output of Readmore.js is unexpected, carefully examine your CSS for rules that might be overriding the library's styles.  Use your browser's developer tools to check which styles are applied to the Readmore elements.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nReadmore.js, being a relatively simple library, may not include extensive built-in error handling. However, good coding practices suggest that you should handle potential issues in your own code.  For instance, you might want to gracefully degrade the experience if the library fails to load or if an unexpected error occurs during execution. This could involve providing alternative text or displaying a message to the user instead of letting the page render incorrectly.\n\nError handling can be achieved by adding a try-catch block around the initialization code or any dynamic update routines related to the library. The catch block could log the error to the console and display a user-friendly message indicating that there was a problem.  If using a module bundler, ensure that you are correctly importing and using the library to avoid any import-related issues.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the API of Readmore.js, assuming a hypothetical structure for illustrative purposes.  The actual API might differ depending on the library's implementation.  Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.\n\n### `readmore()` Function Parameters\n\nWhile Readmore.js might not have a directly callable `readmore()` function in its basic usage (the functionality is invoked implicitly through the `data-readmore` attribute), this section describes a hypothetical API where a `readmore()` function is available for advanced programmatic control.\n\n\nThe hypothetical `readmore()` function could accept the following parameters:\n\n\n* **`element` (required):**  A DOM element (or a CSS selector string) representing the element containing the text to be truncated.  This is the element that would normally have the `data-readmore` attribute.\n\n* **`options` (optional):** An object containing configuration options (detailed in the next section).  If not provided, the library will use default values.\n\nExample (Hypothetical):\n\n```javascript\nconst myParagraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\nreadmore(myParagraph, { height: 100, speed: 300, moreText: 'Show more details' });\n\n// or using a selector\nreadmore('#anotherParagraph', {height:150});\n```\n\n### Options Object Details\n\nThe `options` object (used with the hypothetical `readmore()` function) allows for fine-grained control over the library's behavior.  The following properties are assumed, but you should check the actual library documentation:\n\n\n* **`height` (number, optional):**  The maximum height of the truncated text in pixels.  If specified, truncation is based on height rather than character count.  Default value (if any) would be specified in the library's documentation.\n\n* **`speed` (number, optional):** The animation speed (in milliseconds) for expanding/collapsing the text. Default value would be specified in the library documentation.\n\n* **`moreText` (string, optional):** The text to display on the \"Read More\" link.  Default would be defined in the library documentation.\n\n* **`lessText` (string, optional):** The text to display on the \"Read Less\" link. Default would be defined in the library documentation.\n\n* **`afterText` (string, optional):**  HTML content that will be inserted after the truncated text and before the \"Read More\" link.\n\n\n### Events\n\nReadmore.js may not trigger explicit custom events in a basic implementation.  However, this section describes potential events that a more advanced version of the library *could* offer for better integration:\n\n\n* **`readmore.expanded`:** This event is triggered when the full text is revealed after clicking \"Read More\". The event would be dispatched on the target element.\n\n* **`readmore.collapsed`:** This event is triggered when the text is collapsed again after clicking \"Read Less\". The event is dispatched on the target element.\n\n\nExample (Hypothetical – Event handling would depend on the library's implementation):\n\n```javascript\nconst myParagraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n\nmyParagraph.addEventListener('readmore.expanded', () => {\n  console.log('Text expanded!');\n});\n\nmyParagraph.addEventListener('readmore.collapsed', () => {\n  console.log('Text collapsed!');\n});\n\nreadmore(myParagraph); // Initialize Readmore.js\n```\n\nRemember that these APIs are hypothetical.  Consult the actual Readmore.js documentation for details about its real functionality.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples assume a hypothetical `readmore()` function and API as described in the previous section.  Refer to the actual library documentation for the correct usage.\n\n### Simple Example\n\nThis example shows the most basic usage of Readmore.js, truncating a paragraph of text and adding a \"Read More\" link.  The library would handle the truncation and the creation of the \"Read More\" functionality.\n\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">This is a long paragraph of text that needs to be truncated.  It will continue on and on and on, demonstrating the functionality of the library. This is a test paragraph to show how it works. This is the end of the long paragraph.</p>\n\n<script>\n  // Assuming a readmore() function exists as described in the API reference\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  readmore(paragraph); \n</script>\n```\n\n### Advanced Example\n\nThis example demonstrates the use of options to customize the appearance and behavior of Readmore.js.\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">This is another long paragraph of text. This example showcases the use of options to customize the Readmore behavior.</p>\n\n<script>\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  readmore(paragraph, {\n    height: 150,\n    speed: 500,\n    moreText: 'Show Details',\n    lessText: 'Hide Details',\n    afterText: '<span class=\"readmore-icon\">&#8744;</span>' //Example custom icon. Add required CSS\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nRemember to add the appropriate CSS for `.readmore-icon`  to style the icon correctly.\n\n\n### Example with Custom Styling\n\nThis example demonstrates adding custom CSS to style the Readmore elements.\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">This paragraph demonstrates custom styling with Readmore.js</p>\n\n<style>\n  .readmore-link { /* Adjust class name if necessary */\n    color: #007bff; /* Blue link color */\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  .readmore-truncated { /* Adjust class name if necessary */\n    font-style: italic;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<script>\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  readmore(paragraph);\n</script>\n```\n\nRemember to replace `.readmore-link` and `.readmore-truncated` with actual class names used by the library.\n\n\n### Example with Dynamic Content\n\nThis example showcases how to update the Readmore functionality when the content of the element changes dynamically. This example assumes a hypothetical `readmore()` function and requires a mechanism for updating the text content of `myParagraph`.\n\n```html\n<p id=\"myParagraph\">Initial text.</p>\n\n<button id=\"updateButton\">Update Text</button>\n\n<script>\n  const paragraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph');\n  const button = document.getElementById('updateButton');\n\n  readmore(paragraph);\n\n  button.addEventListener('click', () => {\n    const newText = 'This is the updated text.  It is now much longer than before.';\n    paragraph.textContent = newText;\n    //Re-initialize Readmore.js to handle the updated content\n    readmore(paragraph); // Re-initialize. Method may vary depending on library implementation\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nRemember that the method for re-initializing Readmore.js might differ based on the library's actual implementation.  The above example only presents a conceptual approach.  Check the library documentation for the correct method.  Always test thoroughly to ensure proper functionality with dynamic updates.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
