It enables you to use modern ES modules (`.mjs` files or `<script type=\"module\">`) in older browsers or environments that only support CommonJS or AMD modules.  It achieves this by dynamically loading and transforming ES modules into a format the environment can understand, handling imports and exports appropriately.  It aims to be a lightweight and efficient solution, minimizing overhead and avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Why use es-module-shims?\n\nUsing `es-module-shims` allows you to:\n\n* **Modernize your JavaScript codebase:** Write your code using the clean syntax and modularity of ES modules, even when targeting older browsers or environments.\n* **Improve code organization and maintainability:** Leverage the benefits of ES modules like named imports and exports for better code structure and reusability.\n* **Simplify the build process:** Reduce the reliance on complex build tools, particularly if your project isn't heavily reliant on other build-time transformations.  `es-module-shims` can serve as a simpler alternative for smaller projects or for quickly enabling ES module support.\n* **Support legacy systems:** Gracefully integrate ES module-based code into projects that rely on older JavaScript module systems.\n\n\n### Supported Environments\n\n`es-module-shims` is designed to work in a variety of JavaScript environments, including but not limited to:\n\n* Older browsers that lack native ES module support.\n* Node.js environments where you want to use ES modules without requiring the `--experimental-modules` flag (though native support is generally preferred in newer Node.js versions).\n* Custom JavaScript runtimes or environments.\n\nThe specific level of support might vary depending on the environment's capabilities, but the library aims for broad compatibility.\n\n### Installation\n\nThe installation method depends on your environment and project setup.  Generally, `es-module-shims` is included as a script tag in your HTML for browser environments or as a dependency in your package manager for Node.js projects.\n\n**For Browsers (via CDN):** Include the following `<script>` tag in your HTML file, placing it before your ES module scripts:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es-module-shims\"></script> \n```\n\n**For Node.js (via npm):** Install it as a dependency:\n\n```bash\nnpm install es-module-shims\n```\n\nThen,  require and use it appropriately in your Node.js code (Note: while `es-module-shims` *can* be used in Node.js, using native ES module support directly is generally recommended if your Node.js version supports it).  How you integrate it will depend on your application's structure.  Consult the library's documentation for specific usage examples within a Node.js context.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Module Resolution\n\n`es-module-shims` employs a module resolution strategy that closely mirrors the standard ES module resolution algorithm.  It first searches for modules relative to the importing module's location.  If the module is not found locally, it then consults the configuration options provided (if any), looking for paths or aliases defined.  Finally, it might fall back to a default search mechanism, depending on the environment and the specific implementation details of `es-module-shims`.  This process ensures that imports are resolved in a predictable and consistent manner, mirroring native ES module behavior as closely as possible.  Note that the exact specifics might differ slightly from native ES module resolution in edge cases.\n\n### Import/Export Mechanisms\n\n`es-module-shims` fully supports standard ES module `import` and `export` statements.  It correctly handles named imports and exports, default exports, and re-exports.  The syntax used for imports and exports remains the same as in standard ES modules.  For example:\n\n**Module A (exported):**\n\n```javascript\n// moduleA.js\nexport const myVariable = 'hello';\nexport function myFunction() { console.log('world'); }\nexport default function defaultExport() { console.log('default'); }\n```\n\n**Module B (importing):**\n\n```javascript\n// moduleB.js\nimport { myVariable, myFunction } from './moduleA.js';\nimport defaultExport from './moduleA.js';\n\nconsole.log(myVariable); // 'hello'\nmyFunction();           // logs 'world'\ndefaultExport();        // logs 'default'\n```\n\n`es-module-shims` intercepts these import statements, fetches the necessary modules, and makes the exports available within the importing module's scope.\n\n### Dynamic Imports\n\n`es-module-shims` supports dynamic `import()` statements, allowing for modules to be loaded on demand.  The syntax remains identical to native dynamic imports:\n\n```javascript\nconst modulePath = './myModule.js';\n\nimport(modulePath)\n  .then((module) => {\n    // Use the imported module\n    console.log(module.default);\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error('Failed to load module:', error);\n  });\n```\n\nThe `import()` function returns a Promise that resolves to the loaded module's namespace.  `es-module-shims` manages the asynchronous loading and ensures the module is correctly integrated into the environment.\n\n### System.register\n\nWhile `System.register` is an older module loading mechanism, `es-module-shims` might offer some level of support for it, depending on the specific version and configuration.  However, using standard `import` and `export` statements is strongly recommended for better interoperability and maintainability.  Direct reliance on `System.register` is generally discouraged in favor of the more modern ES module syntax.\n\n### Interoperability with CommonJS\n\n`es-module-shims` primarily focuses on enabling ES modules in environments that don't inherently support them.  While direct interoperability with CommonJS might be limited,  it's often possible to achieve this through appropriate module wrapping or bundling techniques.  If your environment mixes CommonJS and ES modules, you may need to use a separate build step or adopt a strategy that leverages features of your chosen build system (e.g., Rollup, Webpack) to handle the translation between these module systems.  Direct interoperability is not a primary goal of `es-module-shims` as it's designed primarily for enabling ES modules in environments that lack native support.\n\n\n## Usage Guide\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nThe simplest way to use `es-module-shims` is by including it as a script tag in your HTML file before your ES modules.  This approach is ideal for quickly adding ES module support to existing web projects.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>ES Module Example</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es-module-shims\"></script>  </head>\n<body>\n  <script type=\"module\" src=\"myModule.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `\"myModule.js\"` with the path to your main ES module file.  `es-module-shims` will automatically detect and handle the imports within `myModule.js`.  If you're using a bundler (like Rollup, Webpack, etc.), the integration steps will be different; you'll likely need to configure your bundler to work alongside or even in place of `es-module-shims`.  In many modern setups, `es-module-shims` won't be needed as native ES module support is prevalent.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\n`es-module-shims` offers configuration options to customize its behavior, though generally, minimal configuration is needed.  Options are typically passed as a global object, often named `esms` (though the name might be customizable), before loading `es-module-shims`.   The specific options and their effects can vary based on the `es-module-shims` version, so consult the latest documentation for detailed information on available options.  Example:\n\n```javascript\n<script>\n  window.esms = {\n    // Example configuration options. Consult the documentation for available options.\n    nodeResolve: true, // Enables Node.js-style module resolution (if needed)\n    fetchJson: true,   // Enable fetching JSON modules.\n    global: true       //Expose modules globally (not best practice in most cases).\n  };\n</script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es-module-shims\"></script>\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"myModule.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Using with different module systems\n\nUsing `es-module-shims` with other module systems (like CommonJS) requires careful planning and might need extra build steps.  The primary purpose of `es-module-shims` is to enable ES modules in environments lacking native support.  If you have a project mixing ES modules and CommonJS, using a bundler (Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, etc.) is usually a better approach than relying solely on `es-module-shims`.  Bundlers handle the complexities of module system translation efficiently.  For simple projects, a strategy could involve bundling or transpiling your code first and then including the bundled output.\n\n### Troubleshooting common issues\n\nCommon issues include improper module paths, incorrect import statements, conflicts with existing script loaders, and environmental limitations.\n\n* **Incorrect paths:** Double-check that the paths in your `import` statements are correct relative to the location of the importing module.\n* **Import syntax:** Ensure you are using the correct `import` and `export` syntax.\n* **Script loading order:** Ensure `es-module-shims` is loaded *before* your ES modules.\n* **Environment constraints:** Some very old or limited environments might not fully support the features provided by `es-module-shims`.\n* **Console errors:** Carefully examine any errors reported in your browser's developer console for detailed information about the issues.\n* **Version compatibility:** Always check if the version of `es-module-shims` is compatible with the other libraries in use.\n\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nAdvanced configuration typically involves fine-tuning the module resolution algorithm, handling specific module formats (like JSON modules), and potentially customizing how the library interacts with the environment.  Refer to the `es-module-shims` documentation for details on advanced configuration options, which are often context-specific and depend heavily on the environment and project setup.  These might involve providing custom resolvers, loaders or hooks to handle unusual module loading scenarios.  In most cases, the basic configuration should suffice for standard use.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n**Note:** The availability and behavior of some of these APIs might depend on the specific version of `es-module-shims` and how it's configured.  Always refer to the latest documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.  Furthermore, the emphasis should be on using standard `import` and `export` statements whenever possible.  The APIs listed below are primarily for advanced use cases or compatibility with older systems.\n\n\n### es-module-shims global object\n\nThe `es-module-shims` library might expose a global object (often named `esms`, but this is implementation-dependent) that allows for configuration and access to certain functionalities.  The properties and methods of this object are not standardized and may vary between versions. Check the library's documentation for the available properties and methods in your specific version.  Direct interaction with this global object is usually not necessary for basic usage.\n\n\n### import() function\n\nThe `import()` function is a standard ES module feature fully supported by `es-module-shims`. It allows dynamic loading of modules.  The function takes a module specifier (the path to the module) as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to the module's namespace.\n\n```javascript\nimport('./myModule.js')\n  .then(module => {\n    console.log(module.default); // Access the module's default export\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    console.error(\"Failed to load module:\", error);\n  });\n```\n\n### System.register\n\n`System.register` is a legacy module loading API.  While `es-module-shims` might offer some degree of compatibility with it for legacy code, it's strongly recommended to use standard `import` and `export` statements instead.  The support and exact behavior of `System.register` within `es-module-shims` should be verified in its documentation, as it is not the primary or recommended approach for working with ES modules.\n\n\n### System.registerDynamic\n\nSimilar to `System.register`, `System.registerDynamic` is a legacy API related to module loading.  Its usage is generally discouraged in favor of the more modern and standardized ES module syntax.  Check the `es-module-shims` documentation to confirm whether and how it's supported in your version of the library.\n\n\n### System.import\n\n`System.import` is another legacy API for loading modules. Its usage should be avoided in favor of the standard `import()` function for dynamic imports or standard `import` statements for static imports. Consult the `es-module-shims` documentation to understand any potential compatibility offered.\n\n\n### System.get\n\n`System.get` might be used to retrieve a loaded module.  This is typically an internal function of the module loading system and should not be relied upon directly in application code.  Its use might be confined to debugging or very specific advanced scenarios.  Consult the documentation for your specific `es-module-shims` version for details.\n\n\n### System.delete\n\n`System.delete` may provide a way to remove a loaded module from the system.  Again, this is generally an internal function and not intended for typical application usage. Its availability and behavior are highly implementation-specific, and consulting the `es-module-shims` documentation is crucial before using it.\n\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nWhile `es-module-shims` is designed to be lightweight and performant, certain strategies can further improve its efficiency, especially in demanding applications:\n\n* **Caching:**  Utilize browser caching mechanisms (like HTTP caching headers) to avoid redundant fetches of frequently used modules.  A good caching strategy significantly reduces loading times.\n* **Code splitting:** Break down your application into smaller, independent modules to minimize the initial load size.  Load only the modules necessary for the initial view and load others on demand using dynamic `import()`.\n* **Minification and compression:**  Minify and compress your JavaScript code to reduce the size of downloaded files.  This is a standard web optimization technique beneficial for all JavaScript code, including that using `es-module-shims`.\n* **Efficient module resolution:** Organize your project's directory structure to minimize the time spent resolving module paths.  A well-structured project makes resolution faster.\n* **Avoid unnecessary features:** If you don't need certain features offered by `es-module-shims` (e.g., support for specific legacy APIs), consider disabling them in your configuration if possible to potentially reduce overhead.\n\n\n### Custom Module Loaders\n\nFor advanced scenarios where standard module resolution or loading mechanisms are insufficient, `es-module-shims` may allow for extending its behavior through custom loaders.  This would involve creating custom functions that handle the fetching and processing of modules that don't follow standard conventions.  Consult the library's documentation for details on implementing custom loaders, as this is a highly advanced feature that requires a thorough understanding of the library's internals.\n\n### Extending es-module-shims\n\nExtending `es-module-shims` itself (modifying its source code) is generally discouraged unless contributing directly to the project.  The library aims for stability and broad compatibility.  Direct modification might introduce unexpected issues or break compatibility with future versions.  If you need specialized functionality, consider creating a wrapper or plugin that interacts with the library without altering its core components. This approach promotes maintainability and allows for easier updates.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n* **Module provenance:** Always be cautious about the source of modules you load, especially those loaded dynamically.  Only load modules from trusted sources to prevent malicious code injection.\n* **Sandboxing:** If loading untrusted modules, consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate them from the rest of your application.\n* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust CSP to mitigate risks associated with loading external scripts.\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS when loading modules over the network to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\n* **Input validation:**  If your modules process user input, carefully validate and sanitize that input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities.  This is important irrespective of whether you use `es-module-shims` or not.\n\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to `es-module-shims`!

How you integrate it will depend on your application's structure.  Consult the library's documentation for specific usage examples within a Node.js context.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Module Resolution\n\n`es-module-shims` employs a module resolution strategy that closely mirrors the standard ES module resolution algorithm.  It first searches for modules relative to the importing module's location.  If the module is not found locally, it then consults the configuration options provided (if any), looking for paths or aliases defined.  Finally, it might fall back to a default search mechanism, depending on the environment and the specific implementation details of `es-module-shims`.  This process ensures that imports are resolved in a predictable and consistent manner, mirroring native ES module behavior as closely as possible.  Note that the exact specifics might differ slightly from native ES module resolution in edge cases.\n\n### Import/Export Mechanisms\n\n`es-module-shims` fully supports standard ES module `import` and `export` statements.  It correctly handles named imports and exports, default exports, and re-exports.  The syntax used for imports and exports remains the same as in standard ES modules.  For example:\n\n**Module A (exported):**\n\n```javascript\n// moduleA.js\nexport const myVariable = 'hello';\nexport function myFunction() { console.log('world'); }\nexport default function defaultExport() { console.log('default'); }\n```\n\n**Module B (importing):**\n\n```javascript\n// moduleB.js\nimport { myVariable, myFunction } from './moduleA.js';\nimport defaultExport from './moduleA.js';\n\nconsole.log(myVariable); // 'hello'\nmyFunction();           // logs 'world'\ndefaultExport();        // logs 'default'\n```\n\n`es-module-shims` intercepts these import statements, fetches the necessary modules, and makes the exports available within the importing module's scope.\n\n### Dynamic Imports\n\n`es-module-shims` supports dynamic `import()` statements, allowing for modules to be loaded on demand.  The syntax remains identical to native dynamic imports:\n\n```javascript\nconst modulePath = './myModule.js';\n\nimport(modulePath)\n  .then((module) => {\n    // Use the imported module\n    console.log(module.default);\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error('Failed to load module:', error);\n  });\n```\n\nThe `import()` function returns a Promise that resolves to the loaded module's namespace.  `es-module-shims` manages the asynchronous loading and ensures the module is correctly integrated into the environment.\n\n### System.register\n\nWhile `System.register` is an older module loading mechanism, `es-module-shims` might offer some level of support for it, depending on the specific version and configuration.  However, using standard `import` and `export` statements is strongly recommended for better interoperability and maintainability.  Direct reliance on `System.register` is generally discouraged in favor of the more modern ES module syntax.\n\n### Interoperability with CommonJS\n\n`es-module-shims` primarily focuses on enabling ES modules in environments that don't inherently support them.  While direct interoperability with CommonJS might be limited,  it's often possible to achieve this through appropriate module wrapping or bundling techniques.  If your environment mixes CommonJS and ES modules, you may need to use a separate build step or adopt a strategy that leverages features of your chosen build system (e.g., Rollup, Webpack) to handle the translation between these module systems.  Direct interoperability is not a primary goal of `es-module-shims` as it's designed primarily for enabling ES modules in environments that lack native support.\n\n\n## Usage Guide\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nThe simplest way to use `es-module-shims` is by including it as a script tag in your HTML file before your ES modules.  This approach is ideal for quickly adding ES module support to existing web projects.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>ES Module Example</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es-module-shims\"></script>  </head>\n<body>\n  <script type=\"module\" src=\"myModule.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `\"myModule.js\"` with the path to your main ES module file.  `es-module-shims` will automatically detect and handle the imports within `myModule.js`.  If you're using a bundler (like Rollup, Webpack, etc.), the integration steps will be different; you'll likely need to configure your bundler to work alongside or even in place of `es-module-shims`.  In many modern setups, `es-module-shims` won't be needed as native ES module support is prevalent.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\n`es-module-shims` offers configuration options to customize its behavior, though generally, minimal configuration is needed.  Options are typically passed as a global object, often named `esms` (though the name might be customizable), before loading `es-module-shims`.   The specific options and their effects can vary based on the `es-module-shims` version, so consult the latest documentation for detailed information on available options.  Example:\n\n```javascript\n<script>\n  window.esms = {\n    // Example configuration options. Consult the documentation for available options.\n    nodeResolve: true, // Enables Node.js-style module resolution (if needed)\n    fetchJson: true,   // Enable fetching JSON modules.\n    global: true       //Expose modules globally (not best practice in most cases).\n  };\n</script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/es-module-shims\"></script>\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"myModule.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Using with different module systems\n\nUsing `es-module-shims` with other module systems (like CommonJS) requires careful planning and might need extra build steps.  The primary purpose of `es-module-shims` is to enable ES modules in environments lacking native support.  If you have a project mixing ES modules and CommonJS, using a bundler (Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, etc.) is usually a better approach than relying solely on `es-module-shims`.  Bundlers handle the complexities of module system translation efficiently.  For simple projects, a strategy could involve bundling or transpiling your code first and then including the bundled output.\n\n### Troubleshooting common issues\n\nCommon issues include improper module paths, incorrect import statements, conflicts with existing script loaders, and environmental limitations.\n\n* **Incorrect paths:** Double-check that the paths in your `import` statements are correct relative to the location of the importing module.\n* **Import syntax:** Ensure you are using the correct `import` and `export` syntax.\n* **Script loading order:** Ensure `es-module-shims` is loaded *before* your ES modules.\n* **Environment constraints:** Some very old or limited environments might not fully support the features provided by `es-module-shims`.\n* **Console errors:** Carefully examine any errors reported in your browser's developer console for detailed information about the issues.\n* **Version compatibility:** Always check if the version of `es-module-shims` is compatible with the other libraries in use.\n\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nAdvanced configuration typically involves fine-tuning the module resolution algorithm, handling specific module formats (like JSON modules), and potentially customizing how the library interacts with the environment.  Refer to the `es-module-shims` documentation for details on advanced configuration options, which are often context-specific and depend heavily on the environment and project setup.  These might involve providing custom resolvers, loaders or hooks to handle unusual module loading scenarios.  In most cases, the basic configuration should suffice for standard use.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n**Note:** The availability and behavior of some of these APIs might depend on the specific version of `es-module-shims` and how it's configured.  Always refer to the latest documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.  Furthermore, the emphasis should be on using standard `import` and `export` statements whenever possible.  The APIs listed below are primarily for advanced use cases or compatibility with older systems.\n\n\n### es-module-shims global object\n\nThe `es-module-shims` library might expose a global object (often named `esms`, but this is implementation-dependent) that allows for configuration and access to certain functionalities.  The properties and methods of this object are not standardized and may vary between versions. Check the library's documentation for the available properties and methods in your specific version.  Direct interaction with this global object is usually not necessary for basic usage.\n\n\n### import() function\n\nThe `import()` function is a standard ES module feature fully supported by `es-module-shims`. It allows dynamic loading of modules.  The function takes a module specifier (the path to the module) as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to the module's namespace.\n\n```javascript\nimport('./myModule.js')\n  .then(module => {\n    console.log(module.default); // Access the module's default export\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    console.error(\"Failed to load module:\", error);\n  });\n```\n\n### System.register\n\n`System.register` is a legacy module loading API.  While `es-module-shims` might offer some degree of compatibility with it for legacy code, it's strongly recommended to use standard `import` and `export` statements instead.  The support and exact behavior of `System.register` within `es-module-shims` should be verified in its documentation, as it is not the primary or recommended approach for working with ES modules.\n\n\n### System.registerDynamic\n\nSimilar to `System.register`, `System.registerDynamic` is a legacy API related to module loading.  Its usage is generally discouraged in favor of the more modern and standardized ES module syntax.  Check the `es-module-shims` documentation to confirm whether and how it's supported in your version of the library.\n\n\n### System.import\n\n`System.import` is another legacy API for loading modules. Its usage should be avoided in favor of the standard `import()` function for dynamic imports or standard `import` statements for static imports. Consult the `es-module-shims` documentation to understand any potential compatibility offered.\n\n\n### System.get\n\n`System.get` might be used to retrieve a loaded module.  This is typically an internal function of the module loading system and should not be relied upon directly in application code.  Its use might be confined to debugging or very specific advanced scenarios.  Consult the documentation for your specific `es-module-shims` version for details.\n\n\n### System.delete\n\n`System.delete` may provide a way to remove a loaded module from the system.  Again, this is generally an internal function and not intended for typical application usage. Its availability and behavior are highly implementation-specific, and consulting the `es-module-shims` documentation is crucial before using it.\n\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nWhile `es-module-shims` is designed to be lightweight and performant, certain strategies can further improve its efficiency, especially in demanding applications:\n\n* **Caching:**  Utilize browser caching mechanisms (like HTTP caching headers) to avoid redundant fetches of frequently used modules.  A good caching strategy significantly reduces loading times.\n* **Code splitting:** Break down your application into smaller, independent modules to minimize the initial load size.  Load only the modules necessary for the initial view and load others on demand using dynamic `import()`.\n* **Minification and compression:**  Minify and compress your JavaScript code to reduce the size of downloaded files.  This is a standard web optimization technique beneficial for all JavaScript code, including that using `es-module-shims`.\n* **Efficient module resolution:** Organize your project's directory structure to minimize the time spent resolving module paths.  A well-structured project makes resolution faster.\n* **Avoid unnecessary features:** If you don't need certain features offered by `es-module-shims` (e.g., support for specific legacy APIs), consider disabling them in your configuration if possible to potentially reduce overhead.\n\n\n### Custom Module Loaders\n\nFor advanced scenarios where standard module resolution or loading mechanisms are insufficient, `es-module-shims` may allow for extending its behavior through custom loaders.  This would involve creating custom functions that handle the fetching and processing of modules that don't follow standard conventions.  Consult the library's documentation for details on implementing custom loaders, as this is a highly advanced feature that requires a thorough understanding of the library's internals.\n\n### Extending es-module-shims\n\nExtending `es-module-shims` itself (modifying its source code) is generally discouraged unless contributing directly to the project.  The library aims for stability and broad compatibility.  Direct modification might introduce unexpected issues or break compatibility with future versions.  If you need specialized functionality, consider creating a wrapper or plugin that interacts with the library without altering its core components. This approach promotes maintainability and allows for easier updates.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n* **Module provenance:** Always be cautious about the source of modules you load, especially those loaded dynamically.  Only load modules from trusted sources to prevent malicious code injection.\n* **Sandboxing:** If loading untrusted modules, consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate them from the rest of your application.\n* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust CSP to mitigate risks associated with loading external scripts.\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS when loading modules over the network to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\n* **Input validation:**  If your modules process user input, carefully validate and sanitize that input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities.  This is important irrespective of whether you use `es-module-shims` or not.\n\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to `es-module-shims`!
