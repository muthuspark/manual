It provides a simple and intuitive API for implementing swipe gestures on various devices, allowing users to navigate through a series of images or content elements with ease.  SwipeJS focuses on ease of use and minimal code, making it ideal for quickly adding swipe functionality to your web projects.\n\n### Why use SwipeJS?\n\n* **Simplicity:**  SwipeJS is incredibly easy to implement and use, requiring minimal code and configuration.\n* **Lightweight:**  The library is small and efficient, minimizing the impact on your website's loading time.\n* **Dependency-Free:**  SwipeJS doesn't rely on any external libraries or frameworks, making it highly versatile and easy to integrate into existing projects.\n* **Touch-Friendly:**  It's built for touch devices and provides a smooth, responsive user experience on smartphones and tablets.\n* **Customization:** While simple, SwipeJS offers options for customization, allowing you to tailor the slider to match your design.\n\n### Setting up SwipeJS\n\nSwipeJS is typically included via a `<script>` tag in your HTML file. You can download the library from [Insert Download Link Here] and save it in your project's `js` directory (or a similar location).  Then, include it in your HTML like this:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"js/swipe.js\"></script>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) if one is available.  (Insert CDN link if applicable, otherwise remove this sentence).  Remember to include this script *after* your HTML elements that will be controlled by SwipeJS.\n\n\n### Basic Example\n\nThis example shows a simple image carousel using SwipeJS.  First, create your HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"mySwipe\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></div>\n    <div><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></div>\n    <div><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNext, initialize SwipeJS in your JavaScript file (or within a `<script>` tag at the end of your body):\n\n```javascript\nvar mySwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('mySwipe'), {\n  startSlide: 0, // optional, starting slide (0-indexed)\n  speed: 400,     // optional, transition speed in milliseconds (default is 300)\n  auto: 3000,    //optional, autoplay timer in milliseconds (default is 0 - off)\n  continuous: true //optional, continuous swipe (default is true)\n});\n```\n\nThis code selects the element with the ID \"mySwipe\" and initializes a Swipe instance.  Replace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images. The options are optional and allow customization of the slider's behaviour. Remember that the CSS classes (`swipe`, `swipe-wrap`) are crucial for SwipeJS to function correctly, so don't alter them unless explicitly stated in the advanced usage section of the documentation.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Swipe Gestures\n\nSwipeJS primarily responds to swipe gestures.  A swipe is defined as a quick, continuous movement of a finger across the touchscreen (or a similar action using a mouse on desktop).  SwipeJS detects both horizontal and vertical swipes, although it's most commonly used for horizontal swiping through a series of elements (like images in a carousel). The direction and speed of the swipe determine the action taken (e.g., moving to the next or previous slide).  SwipeJS automatically handles the detection and interpretation of these gestures, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nWhile SwipeJS automatically handles the core swipe actions, it also allows you to respond to specific events within your own JavaScript code.  This allows for extending the functionality of the slider beyond the basic swipe navigation.  Event handling is primarily achieved through callbacks, which are functions that are executed when certain events occur.  These events are detailed in the \"Callbacks and Events\" section below.  Generally, these events are triggered by the user interaction (like swiping, tapping, or reaching the beginning/end of the slide deck) or by automated actions (like auto-sliding).\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nSwipeJS provides several configuration options to customize the slider's behavior. These options are passed as an object to the Swipe constructor.  Some key options include:\n\n* `startSlide`: The index of the slide to display initially (0-indexed). Defaults to 0.\n* `speed`: The transition speed in milliseconds. Defaults to 300.\n* `auto`: The autoplay interval in milliseconds.  Set to 0 to disable autoplay. Defaults to 0.\n* `continuous`: Whether to allow continuous swiping (looping). Defaults to `true`.\n* `disableScroll`: Disables scrolling when the slider is active. Defaults to `false`.\n* `stopPropagation`: Prevents event propagation. Defaults to `false`.\n* `callback`: A function to be called after every swipe transition (see Callbacks and Events).\n\n\nThese options allow developers to fine-tune the slider to fit their specific needs and design.  More options might be available depending on the version of SwipeJS used; refer to the library's documentation for a complete list.\n\n\n### Callbacks and Events\n\nSwipeJS provides several callbacks that allow you to execute custom code at specific points during the slider's operation. These are passed as options to the Swipe constructor.  The most common callback is:\n\n* `callback`:  This function is executed after each slide transition.  It receives the current slide index as an argument.  This is useful for updating other elements on the page based on the current slide, updating UI elements, or performing other actions in response to a swipe.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar mySwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('mySwipe'), {\n  callback: function(index, element) {\n    console.log(\"Current slide index: \" + index);\n    // Add your custom code here, e.g., update a progress bar\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOther events might be available depending on the library's version; always consult the updated documentation for the most accurate and complete list of callbacks and events.  Note that the exact names and arguments of callbacks might vary slightly depending on the SwipeJS version.  Always refer to the library's documentation for the latest information.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### SwipeJS Object\n\nThe core of SwipeJS is the `Swipe` object.  This object is created by calling the `Swipe()` constructor, passing the element to be swiped and an optional configuration object as arguments.  The constructor returns a `Swipe` object which provides access to methods and properties for controlling the slider's behavior.  Once created, the `Swipe` object manages the swipe gestures and handles the transitions between slides within the target element.\n\n```javascript\nvar mySwipe = new Swipe(element, options);\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `element`:  A DOM element (typically a `<div>`) containing the slides.  This element should be properly structured with the required CSS classes (as detailed in the basic example).\n* `options`: An optional object containing configuration options (detailed in the \"Configuration Options\" section).\n\n\n### Methods\n\nThe `Swipe` object provides the following methods:\n\n* **`next()`:** Moves the slider to the next slide.\n* **`prev()`:** Moves the slider to the previous slide.\n* **`slide(index)`:** Moves the slider to the specified slide index (0-indexed).\n* **`getPos()`:** Returns the current slide index.\n* **`getNumSlides()`:** Returns the total number of slides.\n* **`kill()`:** Destroys the Swipe instance, removing event listeners and freeing up resources.  This is generally called when the slider is no longer needed.\n* **`toggleAuto()`:** Starts or stops the automatic sliding (if enabled in the configuration).\n\n\n### Events\n\nWhile SwipeJS handles the core swipe actions internally, it doesn't directly expose custom events in the typical `addEventListener` sense. Instead, event-driven behavior is primarily achieved through the `callback` function provided in the configuration options.  This function is triggered after each slide transition and provides the index of the current slide, allowing for custom actions based on the slide change.\n\n(Note:  Depending on the SwipeJS version, additional event mechanisms might exist, often documented within the library's source code comments or within a separate dedicated events section in an up-to-date documentation).\n\n\n### Properties\n\nThe `Swipe` object doesn't expose public properties directly accessible through the object's attributes (e.g., `mySwipe.currentSlide`). The current slide index can be accessed using the `getPos()` method.  Direct access to internal properties is not recommended, as it might break with future updates of the library.  The internal structure of the Swipe object is for internal use and should not be relied upon for external interactions.  The public API (methods and the callback) should be sufficient for all interaction needs.\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Customizing Swipe Behavior\n\nBeyond the basic configuration options, you can further customize SwipeJS behavior through CSS and JavaScript.  CSS allows you to style the slider's appearance, while JavaScript offers more control over the swipe actions and transitions.\n\n\n**CSS Customization:**  You can style the slider's appearance using standard CSS.  Target the classes provided by SwipeJS (e.g., `.swipe`, `.swipe-wrap`,  `.swipe-wrap > div`) to modify the look and feel of the slider, individual slides, and navigation elements (if any are added).  Remember that modifying the core structural classes should be done with caution to ensure compatibility with the library.\n\n**JavaScript Customization:**  You can extend the functionality by using the `callback` function to perform actions after each slide transition, for instance:  changing other elements on the page, showing/hiding additional information related to the current slide, or implementing custom animations.\n\n### Integrating with other libraries\n\nSwipeJS is designed to be lightweight and dependency-free.  This makes it easy to integrate with other JavaScript libraries.  For instance, you could combine SwipeJS with a lightbox library to create a swipe-enabled gallery where clicking on a thumbnail opens a larger version in a lightbox. Or you might use SwipeJS with a parallax scrolling library to create more visually engaging transitions between slides.  Remember to consider potential conflicts or overlaps in functionality and event handling when integrating with other libraries.\n\n\n\n### Handling Multiple Swipe Areas\n\nIf you need to have multiple swipe areas on a single page, you simply create a separate Swipe instance for each area. Each instance will operate independently.  Remember to use unique IDs for each slider element to ensure that each `Swipe` instance targets the correct element.   For example:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"slider1\" class=\"swipe\">...</div>\n<div id=\"slider2\" class=\"swipe\">...</div>\n\n<script>\n  var slider1 = new Swipe(document.getElementById('slider1'), options);\n  var slider2 = new Swipe(document.getElementById('slider2'), options);\n</script>\n```\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance, especially when working with many slides or large images, consider these optimizations:\n\n* **Image Optimization:** Use appropriately sized images. Optimize images for web use (reduce file size without significant quality loss).  Consider using responsive images (`<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute) to serve appropriately sized images based on the device screen.\n\n* **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images to improve initial page load time. Only load images when they are about to become visible.\n\n* **Hardware Acceleration:** Use CSS transforms (`translate3d`) for smoother animations, leveraging hardware acceleration where available.  SwipeJS might already handle this internally, but double-checking the CSS is beneficial.\n\n* **Minimize DOM Manipulation:** Avoid frequent and unnecessary DOM manipulations within the callback function, as this can impact performance. Batch updates where possible.\n\n* **Reduce unnecessary code:** Keep your JavaScript code concise and efficient, avoid unnecessary computations within the SwipeJS callback or other associated functions.\n\n\nRemember that specific optimization techniques may vary depending on the complexity of your project and the number of slides. Profiling your application can help identify performance bottlenecks.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Slider not working:** Double-check that you've included the SwipeJS library correctly, that the HTML structure conforms to the required format (including the necessary classes like `swipe` and `swipe-wrap`), and that the JavaScript initialization code is correctly targeting the slider element and is placed after the element in the HTML.  Inspect the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Swiping not responsive:**  Ensure that there are no conflicting JavaScript libraries or CSS styles interfering with touch event handling. Check for any accidental event listeners that might be preventing swipe gestures from being registered.\n\n* **Unexpected behavior:** Verify that the configuration options are correctly set. Incorrectly set options, especially `continuous`, `speed`, or `auto`, can lead to unexpected behavior.  Carefully review your configuration object for any typos or logical errors.\n\n* **Slides not displaying correctly:** Check that the image paths in your HTML are correct and that the images exist.  Inspect the browser's developer tools to check for any CSS issues affecting the display of slides.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript code. Check the console for any errors or warnings.  The debugger can help you step through your code to pinpoint the source of problems.\n\n* **Console Logging:** Add `console.log()` statements to your JavaScript code to track the values of variables, the execution flow, and the status of the SwipeJS instance.  This can help you diagnose issues with event handling or configuration.\n\n* **Simplify:** Create a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the issue.  Start with a very basic slider and gradually add complexity to pinpoint when the problem occurs.\n\n* **Check for Conflicts:** If using other JavaScript libraries, ensure there are no conflicts with event handling or other functionalities.  Try disabling other scripts temporarily to see if this resolves the problem.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nSwipeJS itself doesn't have extensive built-in error handling mechanisms.  Most errors manifest as unexpected behavior (e.g., the slider not working, slides not transitioning, or JavaScript errors in the console).  Focus your error handling on checking for potential issues *before* initializing the SwipeJS instance.  For example, verify that the target element exists and that the necessary configuration options are valid.  Use `try...catch` blocks around the SwipeJS initialization code to catch potential errors during library loading or instance creation.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nSwipeJS is generally compatible with modern browsers. However, very old or outdated browsers might not support the required features (like touch events or CSS transitions).  Thorough testing across different browsers and devices is recommended, especially if targeting older platforms or less commonly used browsers.  While SwipeJS strives for broad compatibility, some minor rendering differences or inconsistencies across browsers might be unavoidable.  Always test your implementation to ensure it behaves as expected across your target user base's browsers.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple Swipe Navigation\n\nThis example demonstrates basic swipe navigation between simple divs.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"mySwipe\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div>Slide 1</div>\n    <div>Slide 2</div>\n    <div>Slide 3</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar mySwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('mySwipe'));\n```\n\nThis sets up a slider with three slides containing the text \"Slide 1,\" \"Slide 2,\" and \"Slide 3.\"  No additional configuration is needed for this basic example.\n\n\n### Image Carousel\n\nThis example creates a simple image carousel.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"imageCarousel\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></div>\n    <div><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></div>\n    <div><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar imageCarousel = new Swipe(document.getElementById('imageCarousel'), {\n  speed: 500, // Adjust speed if needed\n  auto: 3000   // Autoplay every 3 seconds (set to 0 to disable)\n});\n```\n\nThis creates an image carousel that auto-advances every 3 seconds.  Remember to replace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.\n\n\n### Interactive Menu\n\nThis example shows how to use SwipeJS to create a swipe-able menu.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"menu\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div>Menu Item 1</div>\n    <div>Menu Item 2</div>\n    <div>Menu Item 3</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar menuSwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('menu'), {\n    callback: function(index) {\n        // Perform actions based on the selected menu item\n        console.log(\"Menu item \" + (index + 1) + \" selected\");\n        // Example: Show content related to the selected menu item.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThis creates a swipe-able menu where selecting an item triggers the `callback` function, allowing you to perform actions like showing content related to the selected item.\n\n\n### Custom Swipe Actions\n\nThis example demonstrates adding custom actions using the `callback` function.\n\n**HTML:** (Same as simple swipe navigation example)\n\n```html\n<div id=\"mySwipe\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div>Slide 1</div>\n    <div>Slide 2</div>\n    <div>Slide 3</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p id=\"slideInfo\"></p>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar mySwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('mySwipe'), {\n  callback: function(index) {\n    document.getElementById('slideInfo').innerHTML = \"Current slide: \" + (index + 1);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis example updates a paragraph element (`slideInfo`) to display the current slide number after each swipe.  This showcases how the `callback` function can be used to perform custom actions based on the current slide.  Remember to adapt the HTML to include the `slideInfo` paragraph.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n### What is SwipeJS?\n\nSwipeJS is a lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript library designed to create touch-friendly image carousels and sliders.

Try disabling other scripts temporarily to see if this resolves the problem.\n\n\n### Error Handling\n\nSwipeJS itself doesn't have extensive built-in error handling mechanisms.  Most errors manifest as unexpected behavior (e.g., the slider not working, slides not transitioning, or JavaScript errors in the console).  Focus your error handling on checking for potential issues *before* initializing the SwipeJS instance.  For example, verify that the target element exists and that the necessary configuration options are valid.  Use `try...catch` blocks around the SwipeJS initialization code to catch potential errors during library loading or instance creation.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nSwipeJS is generally compatible with modern browsers. However, very old or outdated browsers might not support the required features (like touch events or CSS transitions).  Thorough testing across different browsers and devices is recommended, especially if targeting older platforms or less commonly used browsers.  While SwipeJS strives for broad compatibility, some minor rendering differences or inconsistencies across browsers might be unavoidable.  Always test your implementation to ensure it behaves as expected across your target user base's browsers.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple Swipe Navigation\n\nThis example demonstrates basic swipe navigation between simple divs.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"mySwipe\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div>Slide 1</div>\n    <div>Slide 2</div>\n    <div>Slide 3</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar mySwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('mySwipe'));\n```\n\nThis sets up a slider with three slides containing the text \"Slide 1,\" \"Slide 2,\" and \"Slide 3.\"  No additional configuration is needed for this basic example.\n\n\n### Image Carousel\n\nThis example creates a simple image carousel.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"imageCarousel\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></div>\n    <div><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></div>\n    <div><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar imageCarousel = new Swipe(document.getElementById('imageCarousel'), {\n  speed: 500, // Adjust speed if needed\n  auto: 3000   // Autoplay every 3 seconds (set to 0 to disable)\n});\n```\n\nThis creates an image carousel that auto-advances every 3 seconds.  Remember to replace `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, and `\"image3.jpg\"` with the actual paths to your images.\n\n\n### Interactive Menu\n\nThis example shows how to use SwipeJS to create a swipe-able menu.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"menu\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div>Menu Item 1</div>\n    <div>Menu Item 2</div>\n    <div>Menu Item 3</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar menuSwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('menu'), {\n    callback: function(index) {\n        // Perform actions based on the selected menu item\n        console.log(\"Menu item \" + (index + 1) + \" selected\");\n        // Example: Show content related to the selected menu item.\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThis creates a swipe-able menu where selecting an item triggers the `callback` function, allowing you to perform actions like showing content related to the selected item.\n\n\n### Custom Swipe Actions\n\nThis example demonstrates adding custom actions using the `callback` function.\n\n**HTML:** (Same as simple swipe navigation example)\n\n```html\n<div id=\"mySwipe\" class=\"swipe\">\n  <div class=\"swipe-wrap\">\n    <div>Slide 1</div>\n    <div>Slide 2</div>\n    <div>Slide 3</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p id=\"slideInfo\"></p>\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n\n```javascript\nvar mySwipe = new Swipe(document.getElementById('mySwipe'), {\n  callback: function(index) {\n    document.getElementById('slideInfo').innerHTML = \"Current slide: \" + (index + 1);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis example updates a paragraph element (`slideInfo`) to display the current slide number after each swipe.  This showcases how the `callback` function can be used to perform custom actions based on the current slide.  Remember to adapt the HTML to include the `slideInfo` paragraph.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
