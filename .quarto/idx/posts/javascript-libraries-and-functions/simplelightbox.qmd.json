Learn installation, usage examples, API reference, and best practices.","date":"2025-02-09","categories":["JavaScript Libraries and Functions"]},"headingText":"Getting Started","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n### Installation\n\nSimpleLightbox can be installed via npm, yarn, or by including the minified CSS and JS files directly in your project.\n\n**npm:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install simplelightbox\n```\n\n**yarn:**\n\n```bash\nyarn add simplelightbox\n```\n\n**Direct Download:**\n\nDownload the minified CSS (`simplelightbox.min.css`) and JS (`simplelightbox.min.js`) files from the [SimpleLightbox repository or CDN](link_to_repo_or_cdn_here) and include them in your project's HTML file within the `<head>` (for CSS) and before the closing `</body>` tag (for JS).\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nAfter installation, initialize SimpleLightbox on your gallery elements.  The simplest usage involves selecting your gallery items and calling the SimpleLightbox constructor:\n\n```javascript\nconst lightbox = new SimpleLightbox('.gallery a', {\n  // Options go here (see below for details)\n});\n```\n\nReplace `.gallery a` with the CSS selector targeting your image links within a container with the class \"gallery\".  This selector should target `<a>` tags containing your images,  preferably as `<img>` tags within the `<a>` tags.\n\n\n### HTML Structure\n\nYour HTML should structure your image gallery as a container (e.g., a `<div>`) containing links to your images.  Each image link should be an `<a>` tag containing an `<img>` tag:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n  <a href=\"image1.jpg\" data-caption=\"Image 1 Caption\">\n    <img src=\"image1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\">\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"image2.jpg\" data-caption=\"Image 2 Caption\">\n    <img src=\"image2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\">\n  </a>\n  <!-- ...more images... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `href` attribute specifies the path to the full-sized image, while the `src` attribute points to a thumbnail image.  The `data-caption` attribute is optional and provides a caption for the lightbox.  Using descriptive `alt` text for accessibility is crucial.\n\n\n### CSS Integration\n\nInclude the SimpleLightbox CSS file in your project's `<head>` section.  If you used npm or yarn, this might be handled automatically by your bundler; otherwise, add it via a `<link>` tag:\n\n\n```html\n<link href=\"simplelightbox.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\nReplace `\"simplelightbox.min.css\"` with the actual path to your downloaded CSS file.  No additional CSS is generally needed for basic functionality, but you can customize the lightbox's appearance by overriding the default styles.  Check the SimpleLightbox documentation for details on customizing styles.\n\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### Overview of Options\n\nSimpleLightbox offers extensive configuration options to customize its behavior and appearance.  These options are passed as a single object to the SimpleLightbox constructor.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst lightbox = new SimpleLightbox('.gallery a', {\n  /* options here */\n});\n```\n\nAll options are optional; if not provided, SimpleLightbox will use its default settings.\n\n\n### Image Options\n\n* **`sourceAttr` (string, default: `'href'`):** The attribute from the `<a>` tag that contains the URL of the full-sized image.  Defaults to `href`.\n* **`preloading` (boolean, default: `true`):** Enables preloading of adjacent images for faster transitions.\n* **`showImageCounter` (boolean, default: `true`):** Displays the image counter (e.g., \"1 of 5\").\n\n\n### Caption Options\n\n* **`captionSelector` (string, default: `'img'`):** The selector used to find the caption within the lightbox item. Defaults to selecting the `img` tag's `alt` attribute.  Note that this can be overridden with `data-caption` (see HTML Structure section).\n* **`captionData` (string, default: `'alt'`):** The attribute used to obtain caption text, if `captionSelector` doesn't return a caption. Defaults to using the `alt` attribute.\n* **`captionPosition` (string, default: `'bottom'`):** Position of the caption (e.g., `\"top\"`, `\"bottom\"`, `\"outside\"`).  `\"outside\"` places the caption outside the image container.\n\n\n### Counter Options\n\n* **`counterSelector` (string, default: `null`):**  Allows you to specify a custom counter element.  If not set, SimpleLightbox will generate its own.  This option allows using your own counter design and placement.\n\n### Navigation Options\n\n* **`nav` (boolean, default: `true`):** Enables/disables navigation arrows.\n* **`showNextPrev` (boolean, default: `true`):** Show Next/Prev navigation arrows.\n* **`close` (boolean, default: `true`):** Show close button.\n\n### Toolbar Options\n\n* **`toolbar` (boolean, default: `true`):** Show toolbar with controls (close, counter, etc.).\n\n\n### Animation Options\n\n* **`animationSlide` (boolean, default: `true`):** Enables/disables slide animation.\n* **`animationSpeed` (number, default: `250`):** Animation speed in milliseconds.\n\n\n### Keyboard Navigation Options\n\n* **`enableKeyboard` (boolean, default: `true`):** Enables/disables keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Escape key).\n\n\n### Accessibility Options\n\n* **`disableScroll` (boolean, default: `true`):** Disables page scrolling while the lightbox is open.\n* **`docClose` (boolean, default: `true`):** Closes the lightbox when clicking outside the lightbox.\n\n\n### Advanced Options\n\n* **`overlayOpacity` (number, default: `0.8`):** Opacity of the overlay.\n* **`rel` (string, default: `null`):** If you have multiple galleries with the same `rel` value, they will share the same instance of SimpleLightbox. This is handy for multiple galleries on a single page.\n* **`classes` (object, default: `{ 'lightbox': 'simple-lightbox', 'nav': 'simple-lightbox__nav', 'prev': 'simple-lightbox__prev', 'next': 'simple-lightbox__next', 'wrap': 'simple-lightbox__wrap'}`):**  Lets you customize the CSS classes used by SimpleLightbox elements for more granular style control.\n* **`loop` (boolean, default: `false`):** Enables looping through images. When you reach the last image, it will loop back to the first.\n* **`onOpen` (function):** A callback function that is called when the lightbox is opened.\n* **`onClose` (function):** A callback function that is called when the lightbox is closed.\n\n\nRemember to consult the SimpleLightbox documentation for the most up-to-date information on available options and their usage.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Opening the Lightbox\n\nYou can programmatically open the lightbox by using the `show()` method.  Pass the index (zero-based) of the image you want to open. If no index is specified, it opens the first image in the gallery.\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.show(2); // Opens the third image\nlightbox.show();  // Opens the first image\n```\n\n\n### Closing the Lightbox\n\nTo close the lightbox, use the `close()` method:\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.close();\n```\n\n### Next/Previous Navigation\n\nSimpleLightbox handles next/previous navigation automatically when the lightbox is open.  However, you can trigger these actions programmatically using:\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.next(); // Go to the next image\nlightbox.prev(); // Go to the previous image\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\n* **`show(index)`:** Opens the lightbox at a specific index (optional).\n* **`close()`:** Closes the lightbox.\n* **`next()`:** Moves to the next image.\n* **`prev()`:** Moves to the previous image.\n* **`destroy()`:** Removes SimpleLightbox from the DOM and unbinds all event listeners, freeing up resources.  Useful for scenarios where you need to dynamically remove and re-add SimpleLightbox instances.\n\n\n### Events\n\nSimpleLightbox triggers several events that you can listen for using the standard `addEventListener` method.  These events are dispatched on the SimpleLightbox instance itself.\n\n* **`show.simplelightbox`:** Triggered when the lightbox is opened.\n* **`shown.simplelightbox`:** Triggered after the lightbox is fully opened and animations are complete.\n* **`close.simplelightbox`:** Triggered when the lightbox is closed.\n* **`closed.simplelightbox`:** Triggered after the lightbox is fully closed and animations are complete.\n* **`next.simplelightbox`:** Triggered when navigation moves to the next image.\n* **`prev.simplelightbox`:** Triggered when navigation moves to the previous image.\n* **`change.simplelightbox`:** Triggered when the current image changes.\n\nExample of adding an event listener:\n\n```javascript\nlightbox.on('show.simplelightbox', function() {\n  console.log('Lightbox opened!');\n});\n\nlightbox.on('closed.simplelightbox', function() {\n    // Perform some action after the lightbox is closed\n    console.log('Lightbox closed!');\n});\n\n//To remove an event listener:\nlightbox.off('show.simplelightbox');\n\n```\n\nRemember to consult the SimpleLightbox documentation for the most up-to-date list of methods and events.  The event names might include namespaces for better organization.  Check the library's documentation for accurate naming.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Customizing the CSS\n\nSimpleLightbox provides a clean and customizable CSS structure. You can modify the default styles by creating your own CSS rules and overriding the existing classes. The main CSS class is `simple-lightbox`, but you can also target more specific elements using classes like `simple-lightbox__nav`, `simple-lightbox__prev`, `simple-lightbox__next`, and `simple-lightbox__wrap`.  Refer to the SimpleLightbox source code or the generated CSS file for a complete list of classes and their selectors.\n\nFor instance, to change the background color of the overlay, you could add the following to your stylesheet:\n\n```css\n.simple-lightbox__overlay {\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7); /* Adjust opacity as needed */\n}\n```\n\nRemember that overriding styles should be done with specificity in mind, ensuring your custom CSS targets the correct elements effectively.\n\n\n### Customizing the HTML\n\nWhile SimpleLightbox doesn't allow direct manipulation of its internal HTML structure, you can influence its appearance indirectly through CSS styling and the configuration options.  For instance, the `captionSelector` and `captionData` options allow you to choose where to find caption text, which can be used in conjunction with custom HTML structuring and CSS to alter how the caption is displayed.  The `counterSelector` option allows using a custom counter element.\n\nFor more extensive HTML changes, consider creating a custom lightbox implementation.\n\n\n### Extending SimpleLightbox\n\nSimpleLightbox's architecture allows for extension. Though not directly supported through a plugin system, you can create custom functionality by extending its capabilities within your own code.  This could involve adding new methods, modifying existing ones, or attaching custom event listeners.\n\nFor example, let's add a method to SimpleLightbox that centers the lightbox vertically:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming 'lightbox' is your SimpleLightbox instance\nlightbox.centerVertically = function() {\n  const lightboxWrapper = this.options.classes.wrap; //Get the wrapper using options\n  const lightboxElement = document.querySelector(`.${lightboxWrapper}`);\n  if (lightboxElement) {\n    const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;\n    const lightboxHeight = lightboxElement.offsetHeight;\n    const topOffset = (windowHeight - lightboxHeight) / 2;\n    lightboxElement.style.top = `${topOffset}px`;\n  }\n};\n\n//Now you can use it:\nlightbox.centerVertically();\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to add a new method; similar techniques can be used to extend other aspects of SimpleLightbox.  Remember to be mindful of SimpleLightbox's internal workings to avoid conflicts or unexpected behavior when modifying or extending its functionality.  Always back up your changes or work within a separate development branch.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Lightbox not appearing:** Double-check that you've correctly included the SimpleLightbox CSS and JS files, that the JS initialization is placed correctly in your HTML (after the DOM is ready and after including the CSS), and that your CSS selector (`'.gallery a'` or a custom one) accurately targets your image links.  Inspect your HTML source to ensure your links have the correct `href` attributes pointing to your images.  Examine your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Images not loading:** Verify the paths to your images are correct. Check for typos in your image URLs and ensure the images are accessible on the server. If using relative paths, confirm they are relative to the correct location.\n\n* **Styling issues:** Ensure your custom CSS doesn't conflict with SimpleLightbox's default styles. Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and identify any conflicting styles.  Remember to use specificity in your CSS to make sure your customizations override default styles.\n\n* **Functionality problems:** Check your SimpleLightbox initialization options to make sure they're correctly set.  Incorrect options, such as an invalid `sourceAttr` can lead to unexpected behavior. Review the API Reference section for proper usage of methods and events.\n\n* **Multiple lightboxes on a page:** If you have multiple galleries, make sure you initialize SimpleLightbox separately for each gallery with its own unique selector. Using the `rel` attribute for galleries that should share the same SimpleLightbox instance will be useful.\n\n* **Issues with specific browsers:**  Test your implementation across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to identify browser-specific issues.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) are invaluable for debugging. Inspect the HTML structure, examine the CSS styles, and check the console for JavaScript errors or warnings.\n\n* **Simplify your HTML:**  Create a minimal HTML example to isolate the problem.  Try removing unnecessary elements or styles to see if that resolves the issue. This helps to pinpoint the cause of the problem more effectively.\n\n* **Check the console for errors:** The browser's JavaScript console will display any errors that occur during SimpleLightbox initialization or execution.  These error messages often provide valuable clues about the problem's source.\n\n* **Debug in steps:** Initialize SimpleLightbox with minimal options first. Gradually add options to pinpoint which option is causing the issue.\n\n* **Inspect the network tab:** Use your browser's network tab to check if images are loaded successfully. Look for 404 errors or slow loading times.\n\n\n### Known Bugs\n\nAt the time of writing this, there are no known critical bugs affecting SimpleLightbox.

Using the `rel` attribute for galleries that should share the same SimpleLightbox instance will be useful.\n\n* **Issues with specific browsers:**  Test your implementation across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to identify browser-specific issues.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) are invaluable for debugging. Inspect the HTML structure, examine the CSS styles, and check the console for JavaScript errors or warnings.\n\n* **Simplify your HTML:**  Create a minimal HTML example to isolate the problem.  Try removing unnecessary elements or styles to see if that resolves the issue. This helps to pinpoint the cause of the problem more effectively.\n\n* **Check the console for errors:** The browser's JavaScript console will display any errors that occur during SimpleLightbox initialization or execution.  These error messages often provide valuable clues about the problem's source.\n\n* **Debug in steps:** Initialize SimpleLightbox with minimal options first. Gradually add options to pinpoint which option is causing the issue.\n\n* **Inspect the network tab:** Use your browser's network tab to check if images are loaded successfully. Look for 404 errors or slow loading times.\n\n\n### Known Bugs\n\nAt the time of writing this, there are no known critical bugs affecting SimpleLightbox.
