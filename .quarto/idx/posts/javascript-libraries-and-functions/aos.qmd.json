It's designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, allowing you to add smooth, visually appealing animations to your website with minimal effort. AOS handles the complexities of animation triggering and timing, letting you focus on the creative aspects of your design.  It supports a variety of animation effects and allows for granular control over animation settings.\n\n### Why use AOS?\n\nAOS offers several compelling reasons for its use in web development:\n\n* **Ease of use:**  The library is incredibly simple to implement and requires minimal coding.  Its intuitive API makes it accessible to developers of all skill levels.\n* **Improved user experience:**  Animations add visual interest and can guide users through your website's content more effectively.  AOS animations provide engaging transitions, enhancing overall user experience.\n* **Enhanced visual appeal:**  Adding subtle animations can significantly improve the aesthetic quality of your website, making it more memorable and professional.\n* **Lightweight and performant:** AOS is designed to be efficient, minimizing its impact on website loading times and performance.\n* **Extensive customization:**  You can easily customize the animation duration, delay, easing, and other parameters to perfectly match your design requirements.\n* **Wide browser support:**  AOS works seamlessly across major modern web browsers.\n\n\n### Setting up AOS\n\nTo use AOS, you'll need to include the library in your project.  You can either download the AOS files (CSS and JavaScript) from the official repository and include them locally, or use a CDN.\n\n**Using a CDN:**  The simplest method is to include the AOS CSS and JavaScript files via CDN links in your HTML `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Local Installation:**  Alternatively, you can download the AOS files and place them in your project's directory. Then, include them in your HTML using relative paths.\n\nAfter including the files, initialize AOS using JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nAOS.init();\n```\n\nPlace this initialization code within a `<script>` tag, ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag of your HTML.  This ensures that AOS is initialized after the DOM is fully loaded.\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nOnce AOS is set up, you can apply animations to your HTML elements using the `data-aos` attribute. This attribute takes the name of the animation effect you want to use (e.g., `fade`, `zoom-in`, `slide-up`, etc.).  You can find a complete list of available animations in the AOS documentation.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<div data-aos=\"fade-up\">This element will fade in from the bottom.</div>\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" data-aos=\"zoom-in\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\"> This image will zoom in.\n```\n\nThe `data-aos-duration` attribute (in milliseconds) allows you to specify the animation duration.  AOS provides other data attributes for further customization, such as `data-aos-delay`, `data-aos-easing`, `data-aos-offset`, and more, allowing precise control over the animation's behavior.  Refer to the documentation for a full list and explanation of these attributes. Remember that you need to include AOS initialization code (`AOS.init();`) for the animations to work.\n\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Animation Groups\n\nAOS allows you to group animations together to create more complex and coordinated effects.  While not explicitly defined as \"groups\" in a single attribute, you achieve this functionality by applying the same `data-aos` attribute to multiple elements.  Elements sharing the same animation name will animate at the same time, creating a sense of visual grouping. You can further refine the timing and order within this implicit grouping using the `data-aos-delay` attribute (see below).  For example, all elements with `data-aos=\"fade-up\"` will animate simultaneously, even if they're not visually adjacent in the DOM.\n\n\n### Triggers\n\nAOS animations are triggered by the element's scroll position relative to the viewport.  By default, an animation starts when the element is roughly in the viewport.  However, the exact triggering point can be finely tuned using the `data-aos-offset` attribute. The trigger occurs as the element enters the viewport from above (scrolling down) or from below (scrolling up).\n\n\n### Offsets\n\nThe `data-aos-offset` attribute lets you control the distance from the viewport edge at which the animation is triggered.  The value is a number representing pixels. A positive offset means the animation starts when the element is a certain number of pixels *above* the viewport top, while a negative offset triggers the animation when the element is that many pixels *below* the viewport bottom. A default offset is usually included, but you can customize it to ensure that animations start precisely when you want, for example, to slightly anticipate the appearance of an element before it is fully visible.  For example, `data-aos-offset=\"200\"` would start the animation when the top of the element is 200 pixels above the top of the viewport.\n\n### Durations and Delays\n\nThe `data-aos-duration` attribute controls the length of the animation in milliseconds. This determines how long the animation takes to complete.  For example, `data-aos-duration=\"1000\"` sets the duration to 1 second.\n\nThe `data-aos-delay` attribute introduces a delay before the animation starts, also measured in milliseconds. This allows you to create sequenced animations or staggered effects. For instance, `data-aos-delay=\"500\"` will delay the animation by half a second. Combining `data-aos-duration` and `data-aos-delay` provides precise control over animation timing.\n\n\n### Easing Functions\n\nEasing functions determine the rate of change of the animation's speed over time. AOS supports several easing functions, allowing for different animation curves. These easing functions are applied using the `data-aos-easing` attribute. The options might include common easing types such as `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, and potentially more library-specific easing function names. The specific available easing functions depend on the underlying animation library utilized by AOS.  Consult the AOS documentation for the complete and accurate list of supported easing functions.  Using the correct easing function can greatly impact the visual appeal and naturalness of your animations.\n\n\n## Animation Options\n\nAOS provides several options to fine-tune the behavior of its animations. These options are set using data attributes on the HTML elements you wish to animate.\n\n### `once`\n\nThe `data-aos-once` attribute is a boolean value (`true` or `false`). When set to `true`, the animation will only play once, even if the element scrolls in and out of view multiple times. The default behavior is `false`, meaning the animation will replay each time the element enters the viewport.  This is particularly useful for animations that shouldn't repeat, such as introductory elements on a page.\n\n### `mirror`\n\nThe `data-aos-mirror` attribute is a boolean value (`true` or `false`). When set to `true`, the animation will play in reverse when the element scrolls out of view. This creates a more polished effect, particularly with animations that involve movement or transformations. The default is `false`.\n\n### `duration`\n\nThe `data-aos-duration` attribute specifies the animation duration in milliseconds.  It determines how long the animation takes to complete.  For example, `data-aos-duration=\"1000\"` sets the duration to 1 second.\n\n### `delay`\n\nThe `data-aos-delay` attribute introduces a delay before the animation starts, also measured in milliseconds. This enables you to create sequenced animations or staggered effects.  For instance, `data-aos-delay=\"500\"` will delay the animation by half a second.  It allows for precise control of animation timing and visual sequencing.\n\n\n### `easing`\n\nThe `data-aos-easing` attribute specifies the easing function for the animation.  Easing functions control the rate of change of the animation's speed over time.  Common options might include `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, and others depending on the underlying animation library. Consult the AOS documentation for the complete list of supported easing functions.  Choosing the appropriate easing function is crucial for creating smooth and visually appealing animations.\n\n### `anchorPlacement`\n\nThe `data-aos-anchor-placement` attribute allows fine-grained control over the animation trigger point. It allows specifying whether the animation triggers based on the element's position relative to its closest ancestor element or its position within the entire page. Useful options include `top-bottom`, `top-top`, `bottom-bottom`, `bottom-top` and potentially others depending on the library's capabilities.  This offers advanced control over animations within complex layouts. Consult the documentation for specific supported options.\n\n### `disable`\n\nThe `data-aos-disable` attribute allows you to selectively disable animations on specific elements or based on device characteristics.   You can use media queries, device capabilities or even custom CSS classes to conditionally disable animations. Check the AOS documentation for the specific syntax and capabilities.\n\n### `startEvent`\n\nThe `data-aos-start-event` attribute allows you to specify an alternative event trigger in addition to the default scroll event. This makes it possible to start the animation triggered by other events, such as mouse hover, clicks or custom JS events.  This is very useful for creating interactive animations and allows more responsive and sophisticated behavior.\n\n\n### `initClassName`\n\nThe `data-aos-init-classname` attribute allows you to customize the CSS class applied to the elements that AOS is initializing. Useful for providing visual feedback during the initialization or if you want to style initialized elements differently.\n\n### `animatedClassName`\n\nThe `data-aos-animate-classname` attribute determines the CSS class applied to elements when the animation starts.  This allows for overriding default styles or customizing the styling associated with the animated state.  This is particularly helpful for applying custom styles to the animating elements.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Custom Animations\n\nWhile AOS provides a range of pre-built animations, you can create and integrate your own custom animations. This involves defining your own CSS animation classes and then referencing them in the `data-aos` attribute.  For example, create a CSS class like `.my-custom-animation` with your desired animation properties using keyframes. Then, apply it to your element via `data-aos=\"my-custom-animation\"`. This approach allows for complete control over the animation's visual style and timing, expanding beyond the default set offered by AOS.\n\n\n### Using AOS with JavaScript\n\nAOS can be controlled programmatically via its JavaScript API.  You can initialize AOS with specific options, trigger animations manually, or refresh the animation state after DOM manipulations.  For example, `AOS.init({ once: true })` initializes AOS with the `once` option, and `AOS.refresh()` updates the animation status after dynamically adding or removing elements to the page. The AOS documentation details available API methods and their usage.\n\n\n### Integrating with other libraries\n\nAOS can often work seamlessly with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.  However, be mindful of potential conflicts. Ensure correct initialization order and avoid overlapping functionality.  If using libraries that manage animations or DOM manipulation, coordinate their use with AOS to prevent unintended behavior.  For example, ensure that AOS is initialized *after* other libraries that modify the DOM.\n\n\n### Handling Events\n\nWhile AOS primarily focuses on scroll-triggered animations, you can integrate custom event handling to enhance interactivity.  You can trigger AOS animations manually using JavaScript in response to user interactions (like clicks or hovers) or other events, making your animations more dynamic and responsive. This allows for creating complex interactions between user actions and the animations.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance, especially on sites with many animated elements, consider these techniques:\n\n* **Minimize the number of animated elements:**  Only animate elements that truly benefit from animation.  Overusing animations can negatively impact performance.\n* **Use lightweight animations:**  Choose simpler animations whenever possible, to minimize processing demands.\n* **Optimize CSS animations:**  Write efficient CSS animations to reduce rendering overhead.\n* **Lazy loading:** Use lazy loading for images and other resources to prevent unnecessary loading of off-screen animations.\n* **Use `data-aos-once=true` when appropriate:**  This prevents unnecessary re-running of animations.\n* **Use `AOS.refresh()` sparingly:** Only refresh AOS when absolutely necessary after DOM updates.\n* **Consider throttling or debouncing:** If you're manually triggering animations through events, consider throttling or debouncing to limit the frequency of animation updates.\n\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nThis section addresses common problems encountered when using AOS and provides solutions.\n\n* **Animations not working:**  Double-check that you've correctly included both the AOS CSS and JavaScript files, and that `AOS.init()` is called after the DOM is fully loaded (ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag). Inspect your HTML to verify that the `data-aos` attribute is correctly applied to the elements you want to animate and that the animation names are valid. Check your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Animations not triggering at the expected scroll position:** Verify that `data-aos-offset` is correctly set if you're trying to control the animation trigger point.  Ensure that any conflicting CSS styles are not preventing the animation from running.\n\n* **Animations appearing jerky or laggy:** This usually indicates performance issues.  Try optimizing your animations (simpler animations, fewer animated elements), or look for conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.  Ensure you're not overusing resources or performing heavy computations in conjunction with the AOS animations.\n\n* **Animations not replaying:** If animations with `data-aos-once=false` are not replaying, ensure the element is truly scrolling out of view and back in.  The element must be completely removed from the viewport and then reappear for the animation to restart.\n\n* **Specific animation not working:** Check the documentation to confirm that the animation name you are using is valid.  Also, inspect the element for potential styling conflicts that might be preventing the animation from being applied.\n\n* **Conflicts with other JavaScript libraries:** If you're experiencing unexpected behavior, check for conflicts between AOS and other JavaScript libraries that manipulate the DOM or animations. Try adjusting the initialization order or using techniques like namespaces to isolate the libraries.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:** The browser's developer console is invaluable for identifying JavaScript errors, inspecting network requests, and debugging CSS styles.\n\n* **Inspect the element's attributes:** Carefully examine the HTML attributes of the elements you're trying to animate. Ensure the `data-aos` attribute and other related attributes are correct and not conflicting with other attributes or styles.\n\n* **Simplify your code:**  To isolate the problem, temporarily remove or comment out sections of your code to determine which part is causing the issue.  Start with the most minimal setup—a single element with a simple animation—before adding complexity.\n\n* **Test on different browsers:** Verify that the issue is not browser-specific. Different browsers may handle animations differently; test thoroughly to identify browser-specific problems.\n\n* **Check the AOS documentation and examples:**  The official AOS documentation and example code can provide valuable insights into correct usage and common solutions to problems.\n\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nAOS is designed to be compatible with modern browsers. However, older browsers or those with limited CSS animation support might have reduced functionality. Always test your implementation thoroughly across the browsers you intend to support.  While generally robust, very old browsers (pre-2015) might experience issues, particularly with certain easing functions or animation types.  The official AOS website should have details on the officially supported browser versions.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section showcases various ways to utilize AOS, ranging from simple implementations to more complex scenarios.\n\n### Simple Animations\n\nSimple animations are ideal for adding subtle visual enhancements to your website without overwhelming the user.  These typically involve a single animation applied to an element as it scrolls into view.\n\n**Example:**  A simple fade-in animation on an image:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" data-aos=\"fade-in\">\n```\n\nThis code will cause the image to fade in smoothly as it scrolls into view.  You can adjust the duration and easing using `data-aos-duration` and `data-aos-easing` attributes as needed.  For example, `data-aos-duration=\"1500\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\"` would create a 1.5-second fade-in with a smooth ease-in-out effect.  Other simple animations include `fade-up`, `fade-down`, `fade-left`, `fade-right`, `slide-up`, `slide-down`, `slide-left`, and `slide-right`.\n\n\n### Complex Animations\n\nComplex animations involve multiple elements, coordinated timing, and potentially custom animation styles.  This allows for more dynamic and visually engaging website experiences.  Achieving complex animations often requires combining several AOS options, including delays, durations, easing functions, and potentially custom CSS animations.\n\n**Example:**  A staggered animation effect on a series of cards:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"card-container\">\n  <div class=\"card\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-delay=\"0\">Card 1</div>\n  <div class=\"card\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-delay=\"200\">Card 2</div>\n  <div class=\"card\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-delay=\"400\">Card 3</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a staggered fade-up animation. Each card fades in with a 200ms delay between them, creating a visually appealing sequence.  You can expand this to create complex entrance animations for entire sections of your page.  Remember to style the `.card` and `.card-container` classes appropriately in your CSS.  You can also combine different animation types within a single container for more intricate effects.\n\n\n### Real-world Examples\n\n* **Hero sections:**  Use AOS to animate elements in your hero section to draw the user's attention.  For example, animate a heading, subheading, and call-to-action button with a combined fade-in and slide-up effect.\n\n* **Feature sections:**  Animate feature blocks or icons to make them more visually appealing and draw attention to key features.  Consider using staggered animations for several feature blocks appearing sequentially.\n\n* **Testimonial sections:**  Use AOS to animate testimonials as they scroll into view, improving user engagement and highlighting client reviews.  A slide-in effect can be effective here.\n\n* **About us sections:** Animate images and text to create a visually engaging introduction to your company or team.  Consider a combination of fade-in and zoom animations.\n\n* **Product showcases:**  Use AOS to animate product images or descriptions, drawing focus to specific products.  Smooth transitions between elements and staggered animations can create an impressive display.  Consider using zoom, slide, and fade animations strategically.\n\n\nRemember to adapt these examples to fit your specific design and content. Experiment with different animation types, durations, delays, and easing functions to achieve the desired visual effect.  Consider the overall user experience and ensure animations enhance, rather than detract from, the usability of your website.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the available methods in the AOS JavaScript API.  These methods allow for programmatic control over AOS's behavior.\n\n### `AOS.init([options])`\n\nInitializes AOS. This function is typically called once, after the AOS CSS and JavaScript files are included.  The `options` parameter is an optional object that allows you to configure AOS's behavior.  Common options include:\n\n* `once`: (boolean) If `true`, animations will only play once. Defaults to `false`.\n* `disable`: (string or array) Specifies selectors or classes of elements where animations should be disabled. Defaults to `'mobile'` (disables animations on mobile devices by default).  You can provide a string selector or an array of selectors.\n* `offset`: (number) Sets the offset (in pixels) from the viewport edge at which animations are triggered. Defaults to 120.\n* `delay`: (number) Sets a global delay (in milliseconds) applied to all animations. Defaults to 0.\n* `duration`: (number) Sets a global duration (in milliseconds) for all animations.  Defaults to 400.\n* `easing`: (string) Sets the global easing function for all animations. Defaults to 'ease'.\n* `mirror`: (boolean) If `true`, animations will play in reverse when scrolling up. Defaults to `false`.\n* `anchorPlacement`: (string) Defines the anchor placement. See documentation for available options. Defaults to 'top-bottom'.\n* `startEvent`: (string) Defines the event that starts the animation. Defaults to 'DOMContentLoaded'.  Possible values include 'DOMContentLoaded', 'load', 'readystatechange', etc.\n\n**Example:**  Initializing AOS with custom options:\n\n```javascript\nAOS.init({\n  once: true,\n  disable: 'phone',\n  duration: 800,\n  easing: 'ease-in-out',\n});\n```\n\n\n### `AOS.refresh()`\n\nRefreshes AOS's animation state.  This is useful after dynamically adding or removing elements from the DOM. It recalculates the positions of elements and updates the animations accordingly. This is a lighter-weight refresh that only updates elements that have already been initialized by AOS.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n// Add a new element to the DOM\nconst newElement = document.createElement('div');\nnewElement.setAttribute('data-aos', 'fade-up');\ndocument.body.appendChild(newElement);\n\n// Refresh AOS to include the new element\nAOS.refresh();\n```\n\n\n### `AOS.refreshHard()`\n\nPerforms a more thorough refresh of AOS, re-initializing all elements. Use this if elements are being added or removed from the DOM dynamically and a standard refresh is insufficient. This is generally more resource-intensive than `AOS.refresh()`.\n\n\n### `AOS.destroy()`\n\nCompletely destroys AOS, removing all event listeners and resetting the state. Use this if you no longer need AOS or need to completely restart its operation after extensive DOM modifications. After calling this, you would need to call `AOS.init()` again to re-enable AOS functionality.\n\n\n### `AOS.update()`\n\n(This method might not exist in all versions of AOS.  Check the documentation for your specific version).  This method (if available) is similar to `AOS.refresh()` but potentially includes additional internal optimization or cleanup.  Consult the AOS documentation to verify availability and behavior before use.\n\n\n### `AOS.isSupported()`\n\nReturns a boolean value indicating whether AOS is supported by the current browser.  This is helpful for feature detection and providing graceful fallbacks for browsers lacking sufficient CSS animation support.\n\n\n```javascript\nif (AOS.isSupported()) {\n  AOS.init();\n} else {\n  // Handle unsupported browsers, e.g., display a message or fallback to static content.\n}\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n### What is AOS?\n\nAOS (Animate On Scroll) is a lightweight JavaScript library that animates elements as they scroll into view.

Useful for providing visual feedback during the initialization or if you want to style initialized elements differently.\n\n### `animatedClassName`\n\nThe `data-aos-animate-classname` attribute determines the CSS class applied to elements when the animation starts.  This allows for overriding default styles or customizing the styling associated with the animated state.  This is particularly helpful for applying custom styles to the animating elements.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Custom Animations\n\nWhile AOS provides a range of pre-built animations, you can create and integrate your own custom animations. This involves defining your own CSS animation classes and then referencing them in the `data-aos` attribute.  For example, create a CSS class like `.my-custom-animation` with your desired animation properties using keyframes. Then, apply it to your element via `data-aos=\"my-custom-animation\"`. This approach allows for complete control over the animation's visual style and timing, expanding beyond the default set offered by AOS.\n\n\n### Using AOS with JavaScript\n\nAOS can be controlled programmatically via its JavaScript API.  You can initialize AOS with specific options, trigger animations manually, or refresh the animation state after DOM manipulations.  For example, `AOS.init({ once: true })` initializes AOS with the `once` option, and `AOS.refresh()` updates the animation status after dynamically adding or removing elements to the page. The AOS documentation details available API methods and their usage.\n\n\n### Integrating with other libraries\n\nAOS can often work seamlessly with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.  However, be mindful of potential conflicts. Ensure correct initialization order and avoid overlapping functionality.  If using libraries that manage animations or DOM manipulation, coordinate their use with AOS to prevent unintended behavior.  For example, ensure that AOS is initialized *after* other libraries that modify the DOM.\n\n\n### Handling Events\n\nWhile AOS primarily focuses on scroll-triggered animations, you can integrate custom event handling to enhance interactivity.  You can trigger AOS animations manually using JavaScript in response to user interactions (like clicks or hovers) or other events, making your animations more dynamic and responsive. This allows for creating complex interactions between user actions and the animations.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance, especially on sites with many animated elements, consider these techniques:\n\n* **Minimize the number of animated elements:**  Only animate elements that truly benefit from animation.  Overusing animations can negatively impact performance.\n* **Use lightweight animations:**  Choose simpler animations whenever possible, to minimize processing demands.\n* **Optimize CSS animations:**  Write efficient CSS animations to reduce rendering overhead.\n* **Lazy loading:** Use lazy loading for images and other resources to prevent unnecessary loading of off-screen animations.\n* **Use `data-aos-once=true` when appropriate:**  This prevents unnecessary re-running of animations.\n* **Use `AOS.refresh()` sparingly:** Only refresh AOS when absolutely necessary after DOM updates.\n* **Consider throttling or debouncing:** If you're manually triggering animations through events, consider throttling or debouncing to limit the frequency of animation updates.\n\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nThis section addresses common problems encountered when using AOS and provides solutions.\n\n* **Animations not working:**  Double-check that you've correctly included both the AOS CSS and JavaScript files, and that `AOS.init()` is called after the DOM is fully loaded (ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag). Inspect your HTML to verify that the `data-aos` attribute is correctly applied to the elements you want to animate and that the animation names are valid. Check your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.\n\n* **Animations not triggering at the expected scroll position:** Verify that `data-aos-offset` is correctly set if you're trying to control the animation trigger point.  Ensure that any conflicting CSS styles are not preventing the animation from running.\n\n* **Animations appearing jerky or laggy:** This usually indicates performance issues.  Try optimizing your animations (simpler animations, fewer animated elements), or look for conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.  Ensure you're not overusing resources or performing heavy computations in conjunction with the AOS animations.\n\n* **Animations not replaying:** If animations with `data-aos-once=false` are not replaying, ensure the element is truly scrolling out of view and back in.  The element must be completely removed from the viewport and then reappear for the animation to restart.\n\n* **Specific animation not working:** Check the documentation to confirm that the animation name you are using is valid.  Also, inspect the element for potential styling conflicts that might be preventing the animation from being applied.\n\n* **Conflicts with other JavaScript libraries:** If you're experiencing unexpected behavior, check for conflicts between AOS and other JavaScript libraries that manipulate the DOM or animations. Try adjusting the initialization order or using techniques like namespaces to isolate the libraries.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:** The browser's developer console is invaluable for identifying JavaScript errors, inspecting network requests, and debugging CSS styles.\n\n* **Inspect the element's attributes:** Carefully examine the HTML attributes of the elements you're trying to animate. Ensure the `data-aos` attribute and other related attributes are correct and not conflicting with other attributes or styles.\n\n* **Simplify your code:**  To isolate the problem, temporarily remove or comment out sections of your code to determine which part is causing the issue.  Start with the most minimal setup—a single element with a simple animation—before adding complexity.\n\n* **Test on different browsers:** Verify that the issue is not browser-specific. Different browsers may handle animations differently; test thoroughly to identify browser-specific problems.\n\n* **Check the AOS documentation and examples:**  The official AOS documentation and example code can provide valuable insights into correct usage and common solutions to problems.\n\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nAOS is designed to be compatible with modern browsers. However, older browsers or those with limited CSS animation support might have reduced functionality. Always test your implementation thoroughly across the browsers you intend to support.  While generally robust, very old browsers (pre-2015) might experience issues, particularly with certain easing functions or animation types.  The official AOS website should have details on the officially supported browser versions.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section showcases various ways to utilize AOS, ranging from simple implementations to more complex scenarios.\n\n### Simple Animations\n\nSimple animations are ideal for adding subtle visual enhancements to your website without overwhelming the user.  These typically involve a single animation applied to an element as it scrolls into view.\n\n**Example:**  A simple fade-in animation on an image:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" data-aos=\"fade-in\">\n```\n\nThis code will cause the image to fade in smoothly as it scrolls into view.  You can adjust the duration and easing using `data-aos-duration` and `data-aos-easing` attributes as needed.  For example, `data-aos-duration=\"1500\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\"` would create a 1.5-second fade-in with a smooth ease-in-out effect.  Other simple animations include `fade-up`, `fade-down`, `fade-left`, `fade-right`, `slide-up`, `slide-down`, `slide-left`, and `slide-right`.\n\n\n### Complex Animations\n\nComplex animations involve multiple elements, coordinated timing, and potentially custom animation styles.  This allows for more dynamic and visually engaging website experiences.  Achieving complex animations often requires combining several AOS options, including delays, durations, easing functions, and potentially custom CSS animations.\n\n**Example:**  A staggered animation effect on a series of cards:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"card-container\">\n  <div class=\"card\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-delay=\"0\">Card 1</div>\n  <div class=\"card\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-delay=\"200\">Card 2</div>\n  <div class=\"card\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-delay=\"400\">Card 3</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a staggered fade-up animation. Each card fades in with a 200ms delay between them, creating a visually appealing sequence.  You can expand this to create complex entrance animations for entire sections of your page.  Remember to style the `.card` and `.card-container` classes appropriately in your CSS.  You can also combine different animation types within a single container for more intricate effects.\n\n\n### Real-world Examples\n\n* **Hero sections:**  Use AOS to animate elements in your hero section to draw the user's attention.  For example, animate a heading, subheading, and call-to-action button with a combined fade-in and slide-up effect.\n\n* **Feature sections:**  Animate feature blocks or icons to make them more visually appealing and draw attention to key features.  Consider using staggered animations for several feature blocks appearing sequentially.\n\n* **Testimonial sections:**  Use AOS to animate testimonials as they scroll into view, improving user engagement and highlighting client reviews.  A slide-in effect can be effective here.\n\n* **About us sections:** Animate images and text to create a visually engaging introduction to your company or team.  Consider a combination of fade-in and zoom animations.\n\n* **Product showcases:**  Use AOS to animate product images or descriptions, drawing focus to specific products.  Smooth transitions between elements and staggered animations can create an impressive display.  Consider using zoom, slide, and fade animations strategically.\n\n\nRemember to adapt these examples to fit your specific design and content. Experiment with different animation types, durations, delays, and easing functions to achieve the desired visual effect.  Consider the overall user experience and ensure animations enhance, rather than detract from, the usability of your website.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section details the available methods in the AOS JavaScript API.  These methods allow for programmatic control over AOS's behavior.\n\n### `AOS.init([options])`\n\nInitializes AOS. This function is typically called once, after the AOS CSS and JavaScript files are included.  The `options` parameter is an optional object that allows you to configure AOS's behavior.  Common options include:\n\n* `once`: (boolean) If `true`, animations will only play once. Defaults to `false`.\n* `disable`: (string or array) Specifies selectors or classes of elements where animations should be disabled. Defaults to `'mobile'` (disables animations on mobile devices by default).  You can provide a string selector or an array of selectors.\n* `offset`: (number) Sets the offset (in pixels) from the viewport edge at which animations are triggered. Defaults to 120.\n* `delay`: (number) Sets a global delay (in milliseconds) applied to all animations. Defaults to 0.\n* `duration`: (number) Sets a global duration (in milliseconds) for all animations.  Defaults to 400.\n* `easing`: (string) Sets the global easing function for all animations. Defaults to 'ease'.\n* `mirror`: (boolean) If `true`, animations will play in reverse when scrolling up. Defaults to `false`.\n* `anchorPlacement`: (string) Defines the anchor placement. See documentation for available options. Defaults to 'top-bottom'.\n* `startEvent`: (string) Defines the event that starts the animation. Defaults to 'DOMContentLoaded'.  Possible values include 'DOMContentLoaded', 'load', 'readystatechange', etc.\n\n**Example:**  Initializing AOS with custom options:\n\n```javascript\nAOS.init({\n  once: true,\n  disable: 'phone',\n  duration: 800,\n  easing: 'ease-in-out',\n});\n```\n\n\n### `AOS.refresh()`\n\nRefreshes AOS's animation state.  This is useful after dynamically adding or removing elements from the DOM. It recalculates the positions of elements and updates the animations accordingly. This is a lighter-weight refresh that only updates elements that have already been initialized by AOS.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n// Add a new element to the DOM\nconst newElement = document.createElement('div');\nnewElement.setAttribute('data-aos', 'fade-up');\ndocument.body.appendChild(newElement);\n\n// Refresh AOS to include the new element\nAOS.refresh();\n```\n\n\n### `AOS.refreshHard()`\n\nPerforms a more thorough refresh of AOS, re-initializing all elements. Use this if elements are being added or removed from the DOM dynamically and a standard refresh is insufficient. This is generally more resource-intensive than `AOS.refresh()`.\n\n\n### `AOS.destroy()`\n\nCompletely destroys AOS, removing all event listeners and resetting the state. Use this if you no longer need AOS or need to completely restart its operation after extensive DOM modifications. After calling this, you would need to call `AOS.init()` again to re-enable AOS functionality.\n\n\n### `AOS.update()`\n\n(This method might not exist in all versions of AOS.  Check the documentation for your specific version).  This method (if available) is similar to `AOS.refresh()` but potentially includes additional internal optimization or cleanup.  Consult the AOS documentation to verify availability and behavior before use.\n\n\n### `AOS.isSupported()`\n\nReturns a boolean value indicating whether AOS is supported by the current browser.  This is helpful for feature detection and providing graceful fallbacks for browsers lacking sufficient CSS animation support.\n\n\n```javascript\nif (AOS.isSupported()) {\n  AOS.init();\n} else {\n  // Handle unsupported browsers, e.g., display a message or fallback to static content.\n}\n```\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"canonical-url":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html","../../schema.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
