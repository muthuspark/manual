It's designed to be easily integrated into existing projects without requiring any external libraries or frameworks.  Unslider focuses on simplicity and providing a clean, responsive sliding experience with minimal code.  Its core functionality revolves around creating a simple, elegant slideshow or carousel with intuitive navigation.\n\n\n### Features and Benefits\n\n* **Lightweight:**  Unslider has a small file size, minimizing the impact on page load times.\n* **Dependency-Free:** No jQuery or other libraries are required.  This reduces the complexity of your project and minimizes potential conflicts.\n* **Responsive:**  Automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.\n* **Easy to Use:**  The API is simple and straightforward, making it quick and easy to implement.\n* **Customizable:** You have control over the appearance and behavior of the slider through simple options.\n* **Accessible:**  The slider is designed with accessibility in mind, allowing users with disabilities to interact with it effectively.\n\n\n### Installation and Setup\n\nUnslider is distributed as a single JavaScript file. You can download it from [Insert Download Link Here] and include it in your project using a `<script>` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"unslider.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nPlace this script tag before the closing `</body>` tag of your HTML document.  No additional CSS files are required, although you can easily customize its appearance with your own CSS.\n\n\n### Basic Usage Example\n\nFirst, create the HTML for your slider.  This involves a container element and the slides themselves:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"unslider\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 2\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 3\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\nThen, initialize Unslider using JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider();\n```\n\nThis simple line of code will initialize the slider on the element with the class \"unslider\".  Remember to include jQuery if you are using this method.  For a pure JavaScript alternative see the documentation for options on how to initialize without jQuery.  This will create a basic slider with default settings. You can further customize it using various options as detailed in the Unslider documentation.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Initialization\n\nUnslider can be initialized in two ways:  using jQuery (if included in your project) or using plain JavaScript.\n\n**jQuery Initialization:**  If jQuery is available, initializing Unslider is as simple as:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider();\n```\nThis will initialize the slider on all elements with the class \"unslider\".\n\n\n**Plain JavaScript Initialization:** For projects without jQuery, use:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUnslider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'));\n```\nThis will initialize the slider and return an Unslider object, allowing for further control. Note that you must select the element using a method compatible with your project (e.g. `document.getElementById()`).\n\nYou can also pass options to customize the slider's behavior during initialization (see the options section in the full documentation).\n\n\n### Navigation Controls\n\nUnslider provides simple navigation controls:\n\n* **Previous/Next Buttons:**  By default, Unslider generates previous and next buttons for navigating between slides.  These are automatically styled and positioned.\n* **Dots Navigation:**  Dots are also generated for visual navigation between slides.  Clicking on a dot navigates directly to the corresponding slide.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:** The slider responds to left and right arrow keys to navigate between slides.\n\nThe visual appearance of these controls is easily customizable using CSS.\n\n\n### Automatic Slideshow\n\nTo enable the automatic slideshow functionality, provide the `speed` option during initialization:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider({\n  speed: 3000 // Slide change every 3 seconds\n});\n```\n\nThe `speed` option defines the delay in milliseconds between automatic slide transitions.  The automatic slideshow can be paused and resumed using methods described in the full documentation.\n\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nUnslider automatically adapts to different screen sizes.  It uses a fluid layout based on percentages, so the slider will scale proportionally to its container. No extra configuration is needed for responsive behavior.\n\n\n### Customizing the Appearance\n\nThe appearance of Unslider can be heavily customized using CSS.  Target the relevant classes and IDs within the generated markup (check the generated HTML after initializing the slider) to modify the styles of slides, navigation controls, and the overall slider container.\n\nFor instance, to change the background color of the slides, you can use:\n\n```css\n.unslider li {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to inspect the generated HTML to identify the exact classes and IDs to target for specific styling changes.\n\n\n### Adding and Removing Slides\n\nAdding and removing slides dynamically requires manipulating the underlying `<ul>` element within the slider container.  To add a slide:\n\n```javascript\nvar ul = $('.unslider ul'); // or document.querySelector('.unslider ul')\nvar newLi = $('<li><img src=\"newimage.jpg\" alt=\"New Slide\"></li>'); // or createElement\nul.append(newLi);\n// Re-initialize Unslider after adding/removing slides to refresh it:\n$('.unslider').unslider('destroy').unslider(); // or use a similar approach with the plain JS object\n```\n\nTo remove a slide:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider ul li:last-child').remove();\n// Re-initialize Unslider after adding/removing slides to refresh it:\n$('.unslider').unslider('destroy').unslider(); // or use a similar approach with the plain JS object\n```\n\nRemember to re-initialize Unslider (using `unslider('destroy').unslider()` with jQuery or the equivalent with plain JS) after modifying the slide list to ensure the slider updates correctly.  Always avoid direct manipulation of the slider's internal state.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Custom Events and Callbacks\n\nUnslider triggers several events during its operation.  You can listen for these events and execute custom code in response.  While specific event names might vary depending on the initialization method (jQuery vs. plain Javascript), you can generally listen for events like `beforeSlide`, `afterSlide`, `complete`, etc. The exact events and their usage will be documented in the main Unslider documentation.  Use these events to integrate custom actions with your slider's state transitions. For instance, you could trigger an animation or update other elements on the page when a slide changes.\n\nExample using jQuery (adapt for plain JS as needed):\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').on('beforeSlide', function(e, data) {\n  console.log('Before slide transition to index: ' + data.to);\n});\n```\n\n\n### Integrating with Other Libraries\n\nBecause Unslider is dependency-free, it can easily integrate with other JavaScript libraries.   You can use other libraries to enhance its functionality (e.g., animation libraries for more sophisticated transitions, or lazy loading libraries for managing large images).  Just be mindful to ensure that no naming conflicts exist between Unslider and other libraries.\n\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\n\nUnslider supports keyboard navigation by default.  Users can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between slides.  This feature is automatically enabled and requires no additional configuration.\n\n\n### Touch Support\n\nUnslider supports touch events on mobile devices.  Swiping left and right on the slider will navigate between slides.  This touch support is built-in and doesn't require any special configuration.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nFor improved accessibility:\n\n* **ARIA Attributes:**  Ensure that appropriate ARIA attributes (like `aria-current` and `role=\"tablist\"` etc) are applied to the slider's elements to help screen readers and assistive technologies convey the slider's state and functionality to users with disabilities. You might need to manually add these attributes if not automatically provided by Unslider.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:** The built-in keyboard support is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse.\n* **Alternative Text:**  Always provide descriptive `alt` text for any images within the slider.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n* **Slider not initializing:** Double-check that the Unslider JavaScript file is correctly included in your HTML and that the selector used for initialization targets the correct element. Ensure your Javascript is placed after the slider's HTML element or use DOMContentLoaded.\n* **Slides not displaying correctly:**  Inspect the browser's developer tools to check for CSS conflicts or issues with your slide's HTML structure.\n* **Navigation controls not working:** Make sure you haven't accidentally overridden the default CSS styles for the navigation elements.\n* **Automatic slideshow not working:**  Ensure that the `speed` option is correctly set during initialization and that there are no Javascript errors preventing the slideshow functionality.\n\nIf you encounter issues not resolved through these steps, consult the Unslider project's issue tracker or support channels for assistance.  Provide detailed information about your setup, the error messages (if any), and relevant code snippets to facilitate efficient troubleshooting.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Unslider Options\n\nUnslider accepts several options during initialization to customize its behavior. These options can be passed as a JavaScript object to the `unslider()` function or the Unslider constructor.  The most commonly used options include:\n\n* `speed`: (Integer, default: 500)  The animation speed in milliseconds for slide transitions.  Used also for automatic slideshow interval.\n* `delay`: (Integer, default: 3000) Delay in milliseconds between automatic slide transitions (only applicable when automatic slideshow is enabled).  If `speed` is used and `delay` is omitted, `speed` is used as the `delay` value as well.\n* `complete`: (Function) A callback function that is executed after each slide transition is complete.\n* `keys`: (Boolean, default: true) Enables or disables keyboard navigation.\n* `dots`: (Boolean, default: true)  Displays or hides the navigation dots.\n* `fluid`: (Boolean, default: true) Enables or disables fluid width responsive behaviour.\n* `nav`: (Boolean, default: true) Displays or hides previous/next navigation buttons.\n* `start`: (Integer, default: 0)  The index of the slide to start on.\n\n\nExample usage (jQuery):\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider({\n  speed: 1000,\n  delay: 5000,\n  dots: false,\n  complete: function() {\n    console.log('Slide transition complete!');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nExample usage (Plain JavaScript):\n\n```javascript\nvar myUnslider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'), {\n    speed: 1000,\n    delay: 5000,\n    dots: false,\n    complete: function() {\n        console.log('Slide transition complete!');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\nUnslider provides several methods to control the slider after initialization.  These methods are usually chained to the slider object.  The specific methods available will depend on the type of initialization (jQuery or plain Javascript) and might vary across different versions.  The available methods might include (but are not limited to):\n\n* `destroy()`:  Removes Unslider from the element, restoring the original HTML.\n* `move(index)`: Moves the slider to the specified slide index.\n* `next()`: Moves the slider to the next slide.\n* `prev()`: Moves the slider to the previous slide.\n* `stop()`: Stops the automatic slideshow (if enabled).\n* `start()`: Restarts the automatic slideshow (if enabled).\n* `current()`: Returns the index of the currently active slide.\n\n\nExample usage (jQuery):\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider('next');\nvar currentIndex = $('.unslider').unslider('current');\n$('.unslider').unslider('destroy');\n```\n\n\nExample usage (Plain Javascript):  Assuming `myUnslider` is the object returned by the Unslider constructor\n\n```javascript\nmyUnslider.next();\nvar currentIndex = myUnslider.current();\nmyUnslider.destroy();\n```\n\n\n### Events\n\nUnslider triggers various custom events during its operation.  These events allow you to integrate custom functionality with the slider's behavior. The events and their parameters are likely to be:\n\n\n* `beforeSlide`: Triggered before a slide transition begins. Receives the `to` (target slide index) and `from` (current slide index) as arguments.\n* `afterSlide`: Triggered after a slide transition completes. Receives the `to` (newly active slide index) and `from` (previously active slide index) as arguments.\n* `complete`: Triggered after all slider initialization actions.\n* `destroy`: Triggered after Unslider is destroyed.\n\nConsult the specific Unslider documentation for the definitive list of events and their parameters.  Remember that event handling will differ slightly depending on your chosen method for initialization (jQuery or plain Javascript).  jQuery uses `.on()` or `.bind()`, while plain Javascript uses `addEventListener()`.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples assume you have included the Unslider JavaScript file in your project.  Remember to adjust paths to images as needed.\n\n\n### Simple Slider\n\nThis example demonstrates the most basic implementation of Unslider.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"unslider\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 2\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 3\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider();\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nnew Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'));\n```\n\n\n### Slider with Custom Navigation\n\nThis example shows how to replace the default navigation with custom buttons.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"unslider\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 2\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 3\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<button id=\"prev\">Previous</button>\n<button id=\"next\">Next</button>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = $('.unslider').unslider();\n$('#prev').click(function() { slider.prev(); });\n$('#next').click(function() { slider.next(); });\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'));\ndocument.getElementById('prev').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.prev(); });\ndocument.getElementById('next').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.next(); });\n\n```\n\n\n### Slider with Autoplay\n\nThis example demonstrates how to enable the automatic slideshow functionality.\n\n**HTML:** (same as Simple Slider)\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider({ speed: 3000 }); // Change slide every 3 seconds\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nnew Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'), { speed: 3000 }); //Change slide every 3 seconds\n```\n\n\n### Responsive Slider\n\nUnslider is responsive by default. No extra code is needed.  Ensure your container (`<div class=\"unslider\">`) is set up with appropriate CSS for responsive design (e.g., using percentages for width).\n\n\n### Complex Slider with Multiple Features\n\nThis example combines several features: autoplay, custom navigation, and a `complete` callback.\n\n**HTML:** (similar to Slider with Custom Navigation)\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = $('.unslider').unslider({\n  speed: 4000,\n  complete: function(e,data) {\n    console.log(\"Current Slide: \" + data.to);\n    // Add any other actions here\n  }\n});\n$('#prev').click(function() { slider.prev(); });\n$('#next').click(function() { slider.next(); });\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'), {\n    speed: 4000,\n    complete: function(e,data) {\n        console.log(\"Current Slide: \" + data.to);\n        // Add any other actions here\n    }\n});\ndocument.getElementById('prev').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.prev(); });\ndocument.getElementById('next').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.next(); });\n```\n\nRemember that these are simplified examples.  You can adapt them and add more features based on your project's requirements and the options and methods provided by the Unslider API.  Consult the complete API documentation for a full list of options and methods available.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to Unslider!

You can download it from [Insert Download Link Here] and include it in your project using a `<script>` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"unslider.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nPlace this script tag before the closing `</body>` tag of your HTML document.  No additional CSS files are required, although you can easily customize its appearance with your own CSS.\n\n\n### Basic Usage Example\n\nFirst, create the HTML for your slider.  This involves a container element and the slides themselves:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"unslider\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 2\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 3\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\nThen, initialize Unslider using JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider();\n```\n\nThis simple line of code will initialize the slider on the element with the class \"unslider\".  Remember to include jQuery if you are using this method.  For a pure JavaScript alternative see the documentation for options on how to initialize without jQuery.  This will create a basic slider with default settings. You can further customize it using various options as detailed in the Unslider documentation.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Initialization\n\nUnslider can be initialized in two ways:  using jQuery (if included in your project) or using plain JavaScript.\n\n**jQuery Initialization:**  If jQuery is available, initializing Unslider is as simple as:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider();\n```\nThis will initialize the slider on all elements with the class \"unslider\".\n\n\n**Plain JavaScript Initialization:** For projects without jQuery, use:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUnslider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'));\n```\nThis will initialize the slider and return an Unslider object, allowing for further control. Note that you must select the element using a method compatible with your project (e.g. `document.getElementById()`).\n\nYou can also pass options to customize the slider's behavior during initialization (see the options section in the full documentation).\n\n\n### Navigation Controls\n\nUnslider provides simple navigation controls:\n\n* **Previous/Next Buttons:**  By default, Unslider generates previous and next buttons for navigating between slides.  These are automatically styled and positioned.\n* **Dots Navigation:**  Dots are also generated for visual navigation between slides.  Clicking on a dot navigates directly to the corresponding slide.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:** The slider responds to left and right arrow keys to navigate between slides.\n\nThe visual appearance of these controls is easily customizable using CSS.\n\n\n### Automatic Slideshow\n\nTo enable the automatic slideshow functionality, provide the `speed` option during initialization:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider({\n  speed: 3000 // Slide change every 3 seconds\n});\n```\n\nThe `speed` option defines the delay in milliseconds between automatic slide transitions.  The automatic slideshow can be paused and resumed using methods described in the full documentation.\n\n\n### Responsive Design\n\nUnslider automatically adapts to different screen sizes.  It uses a fluid layout based on percentages, so the slider will scale proportionally to its container. No extra configuration is needed for responsive behavior.\n\n\n### Customizing the Appearance\n\nThe appearance of Unslider can be heavily customized using CSS.  Target the relevant classes and IDs within the generated markup (check the generated HTML after initializing the slider) to modify the styles of slides, navigation controls, and the overall slider container.\n\nFor instance, to change the background color of the slides, you can use:\n\n```css\n.unslider li {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to inspect the generated HTML to identify the exact classes and IDs to target for specific styling changes.\n\n\n### Adding and Removing Slides\n\nAdding and removing slides dynamically requires manipulating the underlying `<ul>` element within the slider container.  To add a slide:\n\n```javascript\nvar ul = $('.unslider ul'); // or document.querySelector('.unslider ul')\nvar newLi = $('<li><img src=\"newimage.jpg\" alt=\"New Slide\"></li>'); // or createElement\nul.append(newLi);\n// Re-initialize Unslider after adding/removing slides to refresh it:\n$('.unslider').unslider('destroy').unslider(); // or use a similar approach with the plain JS object\n```\n\nTo remove a slide:\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider ul li:last-child').remove();\n// Re-initialize Unslider after adding/removing slides to refresh it:\n$('.unslider').unslider('destroy').unslider(); // or use a similar approach with the plain JS object\n```\n\nRemember to re-initialize Unslider (using `unslider('destroy').unslider()` with jQuery or the equivalent with plain JS) after modifying the slide list to ensure the slider updates correctly.  Always avoid direct manipulation of the slider's internal state.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Custom Events and Callbacks\n\nUnslider triggers several events during its operation.  You can listen for these events and execute custom code in response.  While specific event names might vary depending on the initialization method (jQuery vs. plain Javascript), you can generally listen for events like `beforeSlide`, `afterSlide`, `complete`, etc. The exact events and their usage will be documented in the main Unslider documentation.  Use these events to integrate custom actions with your slider's state transitions. For instance, you could trigger an animation or update other elements on the page when a slide changes.\n\nExample using jQuery (adapt for plain JS as needed):\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').on('beforeSlide', function(e, data) {\n  console.log('Before slide transition to index: ' + data.to);\n});\n```\n\n\n### Integrating with Other Libraries\n\nBecause Unslider is dependency-free, it can easily integrate with other JavaScript libraries.   You can use other libraries to enhance its functionality (e.g., animation libraries for more sophisticated transitions, or lazy loading libraries for managing large images).  Just be mindful to ensure that no naming conflicts exist between Unslider and other libraries.\n\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\n\nUnslider supports keyboard navigation by default.  Users can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between slides.  This feature is automatically enabled and requires no additional configuration.\n\n\n### Touch Support\n\nUnslider supports touch events on mobile devices.  Swiping left and right on the slider will navigate between slides.  This touch support is built-in and doesn't require any special configuration.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nFor improved accessibility:\n\n* **ARIA Attributes:**  Ensure that appropriate ARIA attributes (like `aria-current` and `role=\"tablist\"` etc) are applied to the slider's elements to help screen readers and assistive technologies convey the slider's state and functionality to users with disabilities. You might need to manually add these attributes if not automatically provided by Unslider.\n* **Keyboard Navigation:** The built-in keyboard support is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse.\n* **Alternative Text:**  Always provide descriptive `alt` text for any images within the slider.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n* **Slider not initializing:** Double-check that the Unslider JavaScript file is correctly included in your HTML and that the selector used for initialization targets the correct element. Ensure your Javascript is placed after the slider's HTML element or use DOMContentLoaded.\n* **Slides not displaying correctly:**  Inspect the browser's developer tools to check for CSS conflicts or issues with your slide's HTML structure.\n* **Navigation controls not working:** Make sure you haven't accidentally overridden the default CSS styles for the navigation elements.\n* **Automatic slideshow not working:**  Ensure that the `speed` option is correctly set during initialization and that there are no Javascript errors preventing the slideshow functionality.\n\nIf you encounter issues not resolved through these steps, consult the Unslider project's issue tracker or support channels for assistance.  Provide detailed information about your setup, the error messages (if any), and relevant code snippets to facilitate efficient troubleshooting.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Unslider Options\n\nUnslider accepts several options during initialization to customize its behavior. These options can be passed as a JavaScript object to the `unslider()` function or the Unslider constructor.  The most commonly used options include:\n\n* `speed`: (Integer, default: 500)  The animation speed in milliseconds for slide transitions.  Used also for automatic slideshow interval.\n* `delay`: (Integer, default: 3000) Delay in milliseconds between automatic slide transitions (only applicable when automatic slideshow is enabled).  If `speed` is used and `delay` is omitted, `speed` is used as the `delay` value as well.\n* `complete`: (Function) A callback function that is executed after each slide transition is complete.\n* `keys`: (Boolean, default: true) Enables or disables keyboard navigation.\n* `dots`: (Boolean, default: true)  Displays or hides the navigation dots.\n* `fluid`: (Boolean, default: true) Enables or disables fluid width responsive behaviour.\n* `nav`: (Boolean, default: true) Displays or hides previous/next navigation buttons.\n* `start`: (Integer, default: 0)  The index of the slide to start on.\n\n\nExample usage (jQuery):\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider({\n  speed: 1000,\n  delay: 5000,\n  dots: false,\n  complete: function() {\n    console.log('Slide transition complete!');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nExample usage (Plain JavaScript):\n\n```javascript\nvar myUnslider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'), {\n    speed: 1000,\n    delay: 5000,\n    dots: false,\n    complete: function() {\n        console.log('Slide transition complete!');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\nUnslider provides several methods to control the slider after initialization.  These methods are usually chained to the slider object.  The specific methods available will depend on the type of initialization (jQuery or plain Javascript) and might vary across different versions.  The available methods might include (but are not limited to):\n\n* `destroy()`:  Removes Unslider from the element, restoring the original HTML.\n* `move(index)`: Moves the slider to the specified slide index.\n* `next()`: Moves the slider to the next slide.\n* `prev()`: Moves the slider to the previous slide.\n* `stop()`: Stops the automatic slideshow (if enabled).\n* `start()`: Restarts the automatic slideshow (if enabled).\n* `current()`: Returns the index of the currently active slide.\n\n\nExample usage (jQuery):\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider('next');\nvar currentIndex = $('.unslider').unslider('current');\n$('.unslider').unslider('destroy');\n```\n\n\nExample usage (Plain Javascript):  Assuming `myUnslider` is the object returned by the Unslider constructor\n\n```javascript\nmyUnslider.next();\nvar currentIndex = myUnslider.current();\nmyUnslider.destroy();\n```\n\n\n### Events\n\nUnslider triggers various custom events during its operation.  These events allow you to integrate custom functionality with the slider's behavior. The events and their parameters are likely to be:\n\n\n* `beforeSlide`: Triggered before a slide transition begins. Receives the `to` (target slide index) and `from` (current slide index) as arguments.\n* `afterSlide`: Triggered after a slide transition completes. Receives the `to` (newly active slide index) and `from` (previously active slide index) as arguments.\n* `complete`: Triggered after all slider initialization actions.\n* `destroy`: Triggered after Unslider is destroyed.\n\nConsult the specific Unslider documentation for the definitive list of events and their parameters.  Remember that event handling will differ slightly depending on your chosen method for initialization (jQuery or plain Javascript).  jQuery uses `.on()` or `.bind()`, while plain Javascript uses `addEventListener()`.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples assume you have included the Unslider JavaScript file in your project.  Remember to adjust paths to images as needed.\n\n\n### Simple Slider\n\nThis example demonstrates the most basic implementation of Unslider.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"unslider\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 2\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 3\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider();\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nnew Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'));\n```\n\n\n### Slider with Custom Navigation\n\nThis example shows how to replace the default navigation with custom buttons.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"unslider\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><img src=\"image1.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 1\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image2.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 2\"></li>\n    <li><img src=\"image3.jpg\" alt=\"Slide 3\"></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<button id=\"prev\">Previous</button>\n<button id=\"next\">Next</button>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = $('.unslider').unslider();\n$('#prev').click(function() { slider.prev(); });\n$('#next').click(function() { slider.next(); });\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'));\ndocument.getElementById('prev').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.prev(); });\ndocument.getElementById('next').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.next(); });\n\n```\n\n\n### Slider with Autoplay\n\nThis example demonstrates how to enable the automatic slideshow functionality.\n\n**HTML:** (same as Simple Slider)\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('.unslider').unslider({ speed: 3000 }); // Change slide every 3 seconds\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nnew Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'), { speed: 3000 }); //Change slide every 3 seconds\n```\n\n\n### Responsive Slider\n\nUnslider is responsive by default. No extra code is needed.  Ensure your container (`<div class=\"unslider\">`) is set up with appropriate CSS for responsive design (e.g., using percentages for width).\n\n\n### Complex Slider with Multiple Features\n\nThis example combines several features: autoplay, custom navigation, and a `complete` callback.\n\n**HTML:** (similar to Slider with Custom Navigation)\n\n**JavaScript (jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = $('.unslider').unslider({\n  speed: 4000,\n  complete: function(e,data) {\n    console.log(\"Current Slide: \" + data.to);\n    // Add any other actions here\n  }\n});\n$('#prev').click(function() { slider.prev(); });\n$('#next').click(function() { slider.next(); });\n```\n\n**JavaScript (Plain Javascript):**\n\n```javascript\nvar slider = new Unslider(document.querySelector('.unslider'), {\n    speed: 4000,\n    complete: function(e,data) {\n        console.log(\"Current Slide: \" + data.to);\n        // Add any other actions here\n    }\n});\ndocument.getElementById('prev').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.prev(); });\ndocument.getElementById('next').addEventListener('click', function() { slider.next(); });\n```\n\nRemember that these are simplified examples.  You can adapt them and add more features based on your project's requirements and the options and methods provided by the Unslider API.  Consult the complete API documentation for a full list of options and methods available.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to Unslider!
