## Getting Started

### Installation

Dexie.js is an easy-to-install JavaScript library.  The most common way is via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install dexie
# or
yarn add dexie
```

Alternatively, you can include it directly from a CDN, though this is less ideal for larger projects due to version management challenges:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/dexie"></script> </html>
```

Remember to check the latest version number on the Dexie.js website or npm registry and update the URL or package version accordingly.


### Basic Usage

Dexie.js provides an intuitive, Promise-based API for interacting with IndexedDB.  At its core, you define a database schema, open the database, and then use methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


### Your First Database

Let's create a simple database to store a list of names.

```javascript
// Import Dexie
import Dexie from 'dexie';

// Define the database schema
const db = new Dexie('myDatabase');
db.version(1).stores({
  names: '++id, name' // '++id' creates an auto-incrementing primary key
});

// Add data
db.names.add({ name: 'John Doe' }).then(() => {
  console.log('Data added successfully!');
});

// Retrieve data
db.names.toArray().then((names) => {
  console.log('Retrieved names:', names);
});

```

This code snippet first defines a database named 'myDatabase' with a single table named 'names'.  The `++id` in the `stores` definition creates an auto-incrementing primary key for each record. We then add a name and retrieve all names from the database using promises.  Remember to handle potential errors using `.catch()` if needed.


### Opening a Database

Dexie.js handles database opening asynchronously. The constructor (`new Dexie('myDatabase')`) doesn't immediately open the database; it creates a `Dexie` object that represents the database. The database is only opened when you perform an operation that requires accessing the database (e.g., adding, getting, or updating data). This happens implicitly when you invoke methods like `db.names.add()`, or explicitly when you call `db.open()`.  While `db.open()` is rarely needed, it can be useful for pre-emptive opening in specific scenarios like before the main application logic starts, or to explicitly handle database opening errors before other actions are taken.  For example:


```javascript
import Dexie from 'dexie';

const db = new Dexie('myDatabase');
db.version(1).stores({
  names: '++id, name'
});

db.open().then(() => {
    console.log("Database opened successfully!");
    // Continue with other operations here.
}).catch(error => {
    console.error("Error opening database:", error);
    // Handle database opening errors appropriately, perhaps by displaying an error message to the user.
});

```
  Error handling via `.catch()` is crucial for robust application behaviour.  Always handle potential errors when interacting with the database.


## Defining Tables

### Table Schema

Dexie.js tables are defined within the `stores` object of a database version.  The `stores` object maps table names to their schema definitions.  The schema specifies the table's columns and their properties, primarily the primary key.  It uses a string-based syntax where column names are separated by commas.

A simple schema might look like this:

```javascript
db.version(1).stores({
  users: 'id, name, email'
});
```

This defines a table named `users` with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`.  Note that no data types are explicitly specified; Dexie.js handles data type inference.


### Defining Primary Keys

A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.  Dexie.js supports auto-incrementing primary keys and custom primary keys.

**Auto-Incrementing Primary Keys:**

Use `++id` to create an auto-incrementing integer primary key named `id`. This is often the simplest and most convenient approach.

```javascript
db.version(1).stores({
  products: '++id, name, price'
});
```

**Custom Primary Keys:**

For custom primary keys, simply list the column name(s) that will serve as the primary key.  Dexie.js will use these columns to ensure uniqueness.  You can have a composite primary key consisting of multiple columns.

```javascript
db.version(1).stores({
  items: 'orderId, itemId, description' // orderId and itemId together form the primary key
});
```


### Indexes

Indexes speed up queries on specific columns.  Indexes are defined by adding `+` before a column name in the `stores` definition. Multiple indexes can be created per table.

```javascript
db.version(1).stores({
  products: '++id, name, +price, +category'
});
```

This creates indexes on the `price` and `category` columns, enabling faster searches based on these fields.  Note that the primary key is always indexed implicitly.


### Defining Collections

While Dexie.js doesn't explicitly use the term "collections" in the same way as some other databases, the concept is embodied by its tables. Each table in Dexie.js acts as a collection of objects. The `stores` object definition in the `db.version()` method is what defines the structure and schema for these collections/tables.  Therefore, defining a table automatically defines a collection.  All interactions with the table—adding, retrieving, updating, deleting—are effectively operations on the collection represented by that table.


## Data Manipulation

### Adding Data (`add`, `put`, `bulkAdd`, `bulkPut`)

* **`add(obj)`:** Adds a new object to the table.  Dexie.js automatically assigns the primary key if one is auto-incrementing. Returns a Promise resolving to the generated primary key.

* **`put(obj)`:** Adds or updates an object. If an object with the same primary key already exists, it's updated; otherwise, it's added. Returns a Promise resolving to the primary key.

* **`bulkAdd(arrayOfObjs)`:** Adds multiple objects in a single transaction.  More efficient than calling `add()` repeatedly. Returns a Promise resolving to an array of the generated primary keys (in the same order as the input array).

* **`bulkPut(arrayOfObjs)`:** Similar to `bulkAdd()`, but updates existing objects if they have matching primary keys.  Returns a Promise resolving to an array of primary keys.


### Retrieving Data (`get`, `getAll`, `toCollection`)

* **`get(primaryKey)`:** Retrieves a single object by its primary key. Returns a Promise resolving to the object or `undefined` if not found.

* **`getAll(primaryKey)`:** Retrieves all objects matching specified primary key(s).  If no arguments are given, it retrieves all objects in the table.  Returns a Promise resolving to an array of objects.

* **`toCollection()`:**  Transforms a query into a `Collection` object, providing more advanced querying capabilities chained before using `toArray()`, `each()`, etc.  Useful for building complex queries.


### Updating Data (`update`, `put`)

* **`update(primaryKey, modifications)`:** Updates a single object identified by its primary key.  `modifications` is an object containing the fields to update. Returns a Promise resolving to the number of updated objects (0 or 1).

* **`put(obj)`:** As mentioned before, `put()` can also be used for updating. If an object with the same primary key already exists, it will be updated with the values provided in the argument `obj`.


### Deleting Data (`delete`, `clear`)

* **`delete(primaryKey)`:** Deletes a single object identified by its primary key. Returns a Promise resolving to the number of deleted objects (0 or 1).

* **`clear()`:** Deletes all objects from the table. Returns a Promise.


### Transactions

Dexie.js supports transactions to ensure data integrity.  Use `db.transaction()` to wrap multiple database operations within a single transaction. If any operation fails within the transaction, the entire transaction is rolled back.

```javascript
db.transaction('rw', db.users, db.products, function* () {
  yield db.users.add({ name: 'Jane Doe' });
  yield db.products.add({ name: 'Widget', price: 10 });
});
```

### Where Clauses

Dexie.js uses `.where()` to filter results based on various conditions:

```javascript
db.users.where('age').above(25).toArray(); // Get all users older than 25
db.products.where('price').between(10, 20).toArray(); //Get products with price between 10 and 20
db.users.where('name').startsWith('J').toArray(); // Get all users whose name starts with 'J'
```

You can chain multiple `.where()` clauses, though this is more efficient with indexes on the relevant fields.


### Ordering Results

Use `.orderBy()` to sort the results of a query:

```javascript
db.products.orderBy('price').toArray(); // Order products by price (ascending)
db.products.orderBy('price').reverse().toArray(); // Order products by price (descending)
db.products.orderBy('category', 'price').toArray();// Order by category, then price.
```

Multiple columns can be used for multi-level sorting.


### Filtering Results

The `.filter()` method allows you to filter the results based on a custom function:

```javascript
db.products.where('price').above(10).filter(product => product.category === 'Electronics').toArray();
```


### Limiting Results

Use `.limit()` to restrict the number of results returned:

```javascript
db.products.orderBy('price').limit(5).toArray(); // Get the 5 cheapest products
```

`.offset()` can be used in conjunction with `.limit()` to skip a certain number of results:

```javascript
db.products.orderBy('price').offset(5).limit(5).toArray();// Get products ranked 6-10 by price
```

Remember to chain these methods appropriately for complex queries.  Using indexes whenever possible significantly improves query performance.


## Advanced Features

### Database Events

Dexie.js emits several events that allow you to react to database changes and lifecycle events.  These events are typically handled using the `.on()` method.  Common events include:

* **`'populate'`:** Fired when the database is populated from IndexedDB.
* **`'ready'`:** Fired when the database is ready for use after opening.
* **`'blocked'`:** Fired when another tab or window is blocking database access.
* **`'versionchange'`:** Fired when a version change is requested.  This is useful for handling schema migrations smoothly across different browser tabs or windows.
* **`'upgrade'`:** Fired during database upgrades, allowing custom upgrade logic.

Example:

```javascript
db.on('ready', () => console.log('Database is ready'));
db.on('blocked', () => console.warn('Database is blocked'));
```


### Collections

Dexie Collections, returned by `db.table.toCollection()`, offer a fluent API for building complex queries and chaining operations before executing them with methods like `toArray()`, `each()`, `count()`, etc.  They act as a sort of deferred execution mechanism, giving more control over how and when queries are executed.  Efficient for complex queries or scenarios requiring multiple operations on the same subset of data.


### Upgrade Strategies

When upgrading database versions, you must handle schema changes within the `upgrade` event handler of the `Dexie.version()` method. This ensures data integrity during schema migrations.  Use transactions within the `upgrade` function to ensure atomicity of operations.


### Hooks

Dexie.js allows defining hooks to run specific code before or after database operations.  These hooks provide opportunities for logging, validation, or other custom logic:

* **`before` hooks:** Run before an operation (e.g., `add`, `put`, `update`, `delete`).
* **`after` hooks:** Run after an operation.

Hooks are defined using the `hook()` method.  For instance, creating a `before` hook that logs operations:


```javascript
db.users.hook('beforeAdd', (primKey, obj, transaction) => {
    console.log("Adding user:", obj);
});
```


### Custom Table Methods

You can add custom methods to your tables to encapsulate frequently used operations or create reusable logic.  This helps to enhance code readability and maintainability:


```javascript
db.users.method('findByEmail', function(email) {
  return this.where('email').equals(email).first();
});

// Usage:
db.users.findByEmail('test@example.com').then(user => { /* ... */ });
```


### Versioning and Migrations

Dexie.js uses versions to manage schema changes.  Each version is defined using `db.version(number)`, and the `upgrade` function within this definition contains the necessary upgrade logic.  For example:

```javascript
db.version(2).stores({
    users: '++id, name, email, address'
}).upgrade(function (trans) {
    if (trans.db.version === 1) {
        // upgrade logic from version 1 to version 2
        trans.db.users.toCollection().modify({address: null}); //add a new field `address`
    }
});

```


### Working with Blobs and Files

Dexie.js handles Blobs and Files seamlessly.  You can store and retrieve them just like any other data type, using methods like `add()` and `get()`.  The key is that the database will store references to the blobs, not the entire blob data directly in the table itself.


### Error Handling

Always use `.catch()` to handle potential errors during database operations.  Dexie.js throws errors for various reasons, including invalid queries, database failures, and schema mismatches.  Appropriate error handling is crucial for application robustness.  Check for specific error types (e.g., `Dexie.NoSuchPrimaryKey`, `Dexie.SchemaError`, etc.) to provide user-friendly error messages.


### Performance Tuning

* **Use Indexes:** Create indexes on frequently queried columns to significantly improve query performance.
* **Minimize Transactions:**  Use transactions judiciously, as large transactions can impact performance.
* **Efficient Queries:** Avoid `getAll()` if possible when only one or a few specific records are needed; instead use `get()` or `where()` for more targeted retrievals.
* **Batch Operations:**  Use `bulkAdd()` and `bulkPut()` for adding or updating multiple records efficiently.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Always use Promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations gracefully, preventing blocking.
* **Data Validation:** Perform data validation before writing to the database to prevent issues that might require rollback.




## Working with Different Data Types

Dexie.js handles various JavaScript data types with minimal friction.  However, understanding how these types are stored and retrieved can lead to more efficient and robust code.

### Numbers

Numbers are stored as their native JavaScript numeric representations (both integers and floating-point numbers).  Dexie.js automatically handles type inference and conversion.  No special handling is usually needed.

```javascript
db.myTable.add({ count: 10, price: 99.99 });
```


### Strings

Strings are stored as native JavaScript strings.  No special encoding or escaping is typically required, though you might need to handle encoding/decoding if you're interacting with external systems that might use different character encodings.

```javascript
db.myTable.add({ name: 'John Doe', description: 'A long string with various characters.' });
```


### Dates

Dates are stored as timestamps (the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch).  When retrieving a Date object from the database, Dexie.js automatically converts the timestamp back into a `Date` object.

```javascript
const now = new Date();
db.myTable.add({ created: now });

// ... later ...

db.myTable.get(1).then(item => {
  console.log(item.created instanceof Date); // true
});
```


### Arrays

Arrays are stored as JavaScript arrays.  There are no special constraints on the data types within the array; they can be a mix of numbers, strings, objects, etc.  However, for better queryability, consider structuring your data to avoid deeply nested arrays if possible.

```javascript
db.myTable.add({ tags: ['javascript', 'indexeddb', 'dexie'] });
```

### Objects

Objects are stored as JavaScript objects.  They are generally handled without special treatment, but remember that you cannot directly query the properties of nested objects unless you design your schema to reflect the necessary structure for querying.


```javascript
db.myTable.add({ user: { name: 'Jane', age: 30 } });
```

To efficiently query nested data, flatten your object structure where needed for indexing or pre-process the data for easier querying.

### JSON

While Dexie.js doesn't have a specific JSON type, you can store JSON data as strings.  You will need to explicitly parse the JSON strings using `JSON.parse()` when retrieving and `JSON.stringify()` when storing.

```javascript
const jsonData = { name: 'Test', data: [1, 2, 3] };
db.myTable.add({ data: JSON.stringify(jsonData) }).then(() => {
  // ...
});

// Retrieving and parsing:
db.myTable.get(1).then(item => {
    const parsedData = JSON.parse(item.data);
    // Use parsedData
});
```

### Blobs

Blobs (Binary Large Objects) are stored as Blobs. Dexie.js handles them efficiently, storing references to the actual blob data within IndexedDB.  When retrieving a Blob, you receive a new Blob object representing the data.  For large Blobs, consider optimizing your data handling to avoid loading unnecessary data into memory.

```javascript
const myBlob = new Blob(['Hello, world!'], { type: 'text/plain' });
db.myTable.add({ myBlob: myBlob });
```


Remember that efficient data modeling and indexing are critical for optimal performance when working with large datasets or complex data structures in Dexie.js.  Consider optimizing your data structure to support efficient querying.


## Best Practices

### Database Design

Careful database design is crucial for performance and maintainability. Consider these points:

* **Schema Normalization:**  Design your schema to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.  Avoid storing the same data in multiple places.
* **Data Types:** Choose appropriate data types for each field to optimize storage and retrieval.
* **Indexes:** Strategically create indexes on frequently queried columns to significantly improve query speed. Avoid over-indexing, as this can slow down write operations.
* **Relationships:**  If your data has relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many), design your schema to represent them efficiently. Consider using separate tables linked by foreign keys instead of embedding related data within a single object.
* **Scalability:** Design your database to scale with your application's growth. This might involve considering data partitioning or sharding strategies for very large datasets.


### Schema Optimization

* **Avoid Over-Normalization:** While normalization is beneficial, excessive normalization can lead to overly complex schemas and slower queries. Strive for a balance between normalization and efficiency.
* **Primary Keys:** Choose appropriate primary keys. Auto-incrementing keys are generally a good default choice, but custom primary keys might be necessary depending on your data model.
* **Indexes:** Carefully select the columns to index. Index columns frequently used in `where` clauses, `orderBy` clauses, and joins.  Experiment with different indexes to find the optimal configuration.


### Query Optimization

* **Use Indexes:**  Leverage indexes to speed up queries. Without indexes, Dexie.js will perform full table scans, which can be very slow for large datasets.
* **Avoid `getAll()`:** Use `getAll()` only when necessary to retrieve all data. For specific records, prefer `get()` or queries using `.where()`.
* **Limit and Offset:** Use `limit()` and `offset()` to reduce the amount of data retrieved, improving query performance, especially for paginated results.
* **Chaining:**  Chain Dexie's query methods effectively. This is often more efficient than executing multiple separate queries.
* **Transactions:** Use transactions to wrap multiple database operations for data integrity and, sometimes, improved performance.  However, very large transactions should be avoided.


### Error Handling Best Practices

* **`catch()` Blocks:** Always include `.catch()` blocks in your asynchronous database operations to handle potential errors gracefully.
* **Specific Error Handling:**  Try to catch and handle specific error types (e.g., `Dexie.NoSuchPrimaryKey`, `Dexie.TransactionError`) to provide more informative error messages and error recovery strategies.
* **User Feedback:** Provide user-friendly error messages rather than displaying technical details to the end user.
* **Logging:** Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes, storing the error details for later analysis.
* **Retry Logic:**  For transient errors (e.g., network issues), you might incorporate retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.


### Testing and Debugging

* **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your database interactions, ensuring data consistency and preventing regressions.
* **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between your database and other parts of your application.
* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (especially the console) to inspect database operations, debug queries, and examine error messages.  Pay attention to network requests and database interactions when troubleshooting.
* **Dexie's Debug Mode:**  Enable Dexie's debug mode (`Dexie.debug = true;`) to get additional logging information which can be helpful during development and debugging.
* **Version Control:** Use version control to track changes to your database schema and code, making it easy to revert to previous states if necessary.





## API Reference

This section provides a concise overview of the core Dexie.js API objects.  For complete and up-to-date details, refer to the official Dexie.js documentation.

### Dexie Object

The `Dexie` object represents the entire database.  It's created using the `new Dexie(dbName)` constructor.  Key methods include:

### Transaction Object

The `Transaction` object represents a database transaction.  It's created via `db.transaction()`. Key properties and methods:

* **`tables`:**  An array of the tables involved in the transaction.
* **`mode`:** The transaction mode ('rw' for read-write, 'r' for read-only).
* **`table(tableName)`:** Returns the `Table` object for a table within this transaction.


### KeyRange Object

The `KeyRange` object is used to specify a range of keys in `where` clauses.  It's not directly created by the user but is used by functions such as `.where(...).between(a, b)`.


### Helper Functions

Dexie.js provides several helper functions:

* **`Dexie.Promise.resolve()`/`Dexie.Promise.reject()`:**  Promise creation methods.
* **`Dexie.liveQuery()`:** Creates a live query, reacting to changes.  Useful for real-time updates.

This API reference provides a high-level overview.  Refer to the official documentation for detailed descriptions, examples, and exhaustive coverage of all options and methods.  The official documentation is the most accurate and updated source for Dexie.js's API.


## Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues and strategies for resolving them when working with Dexie.js.

### Common Errors

* **`Dexie.NoSuchPrimaryKey`:** This error occurs when trying to access a record using `get()` or `delete()` with a primary key that doesn't exist. Double-check the primary key value and ensure it's correct.

* **`Dexie.SchemaError`:**  This indicates a schema mismatch, typically occurring during database upgrades. Review your upgrade logic in the `upgrade()` function within `db.version()`. Ensure that all schema changes are handled correctly and that transactions are used within the upgrade function.

* **`Dexie.QuotaExceededError`:**  This error indicates that the browser's storage quota has been exceeded.  Consider optimizing your database design, removing unnecessary data, or implementing strategies for managing storage limits.

* **`TypeError: this.transaction is undefined`:** This often happens when calling database methods outside of a transaction or outside an async function that is part of a transaction. Ensure that all database operations are within an appropriate transaction context.

* **Promise Rejection:**  If your database operations fail silently, make sure you have properly handled the Promise rejections using `.catch()`. Check the error object provided in the `catch` block for details on what went wrong.

* **`Error opening database`:** This can be caused by multiple things: permission problems, browser restrictions, a database with the same name already open (check for this in other tabs).


### Debugging Techniques

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (especially the console) to examine errors, inspect network requests, and step through your code.

* **`Dexie.debug = true;`:**  Setting `Dexie.debug` to `true` enables verbose logging that can be very helpful in identifying issues.  This provides detailed information about queries and database operations.

* **Logging:** Add `console.log()` statements at strategic points in your code to track data and identify where errors might be originating. Log the data being added to the database to see if it is what you expected.

* **Simplify Your Code:** Isolate problematic sections of code by temporarily removing or commenting out parts to identify the root cause.

* **Check for Race Conditions:** Be aware of potential race conditions if multiple parts of your application access the database concurrently.  Use transactions to ensure data integrity.



### Troubleshooting Browser Compatibility

Dexie.js generally supports modern browsers. However, ensure that you're targeting browsers with adequate IndexedDB support.  Older browsers might not support all Dexie.js features or might have different IndexedDB implementations that behave slightly differently.


### Finding Help and Support

* **Dexie.js Documentation:** The official Dexie.js documentation is an excellent resource, providing detailed explanations, examples, and API references.
