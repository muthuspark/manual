## Introduction

### What is Style Switcher?

Style Switcher is a [insert technology, e.g., JavaScript library, CSS framework component] designed to allow users to easily change the visual style of a website or web application.  This is achieved by dynamically switching between pre-defined stylesheets or themes, without requiring a page reload.  The switcher itself can be implemented as a simple interface (e.g., dropdown menu, radio buttons) that allows users to select their preferred style.

### Why Use Style Switcher?

Using a Style Switcher offers several advantages:

* **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides users with greater control over the website's appearance, catering to personal preferences and accessibility needs (e.g., high contrast themes).
* **Improved Accessibility:** Allows users to select high-contrast or other accessibility-focused themes, improving usability for individuals with visual impairments.
* **Branding Flexibility:**  Easily switch between different brand styles or themes without modifying core code.  Useful for A/B testing different visual designs or supporting multiple brands on a single platform.
* **Simplified Theme Management:** Centralizes theme management, making it easier to update, add, or remove styles.  Reduces the complexity of maintaining multiple stylesheets or CSS files.
* **Faster Development:** Streamlines the process of creating and deploying different visual styles.


### Key Features

* **Easy Integration:** Simple and straightforward implementation using [insert method, e.g., a single JavaScript include, a few lines of HTML and CSS].
* **Multiple Theme Support:** Ability to load and switch between multiple pre-defined themes.
* **Customizable Interface:**  Highly configurable interface, allowing developers to tailor the switcher's appearance and functionality.
* **Responsive Design:** The switcher adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
* **Persistence:**  User's selected theme is remembered across sessions (using browser storage like `localStorage`).
* **[Add any other relevant feature, e.g.,  Theme Previews,  API for programmatic control].**


### Target Audience

This Style Switcher is intended for web developers, front-end engineers, and designers who need a simple and efficient way to implement theme switching capabilities into their web projects.  It is suitable for both small and large-scale applications and requires a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Getting Started

### Installation

There are [insert number] ways to install the Style Switcher:

**Method 1: Using a Package Manager (e.g., npm, yarn)**

If you are using a package manager, you can install the Style Switcher via:

```bash
npm install style-switcher-package-name  // Replace with actual package name
# or
yarn add style-switcher-package-name     // Replace with actual package name
```

**Method 2: Downloading the Files**

Alternatively, you can download the Style Switcher directly from [insert download link].  Extract the downloaded archive and include the necessary files (usually CSS and JavaScript) in your project.


### Basic Usage

After installation, include the Style Switcher's JavaScript and CSS files in your HTML file within the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style-switcher.css">
<script src="path/to/style-switcher.js"></script>
```

Then, add a container element in your HTML where the Style Switcher interface will be rendered. This could be a `<div>` or any suitable element.  Give it a unique ID, for example `style-switcher-container`:

```html
<div id="style-switcher-container"></div>
```

Finally, initialize the Style Switcher with the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
const styleSwitcher = new StyleSwitcher({
  containerId: 'style-switcher-container', // ID of the container element
  themes: [ // Array of theme objects (see "Setting up Stylesheets" below)
    { name: 'light', url: 'light.css' },
    { name: 'dark', url: 'dark.css' },
    // ... more themes
  ]
});
```


### Setting up the Stylesheets

Create your theme stylesheets (e.g., `light.css`, `dark.css`) and place them in the appropriate directory.  Each stylesheet should define the visual styles for your website.  In the `themes` array passed to the `StyleSwitcher` constructor (see Basic Usage), each theme object requires a `name` (used for identification and display in the switcher UI) and a `url` (path to the stylesheet).


### First Example

Let's create a simple example with two themes: "light" and "dark."

1. **Create Stylesheets:** Create `light.css` and `dark.css` with the following content (replace these with your actual styles):

   **light.css:**
   ```css
   body {
     background-color: #fff;
     color: #333;
   }
   ```

   **dark.css:**
   ```css
   body {
     background-color: #333;
     color: #fff;
   }
   ```


2. **Include Files and Initialize:**  In your HTML, include the Style Switcher files (as shown in "Basic Usage") and initialize it:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Style Switcher Example</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style-switcher.css">  </link>
     <script src="path/to/style-switcher.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
     <div id="style-switcher-container"></div>
     <script>
       const styleSwitcher = new StyleSwitcher({
         containerId: 'style-switcher-container',
         themes: [
           { name: 'light', url: 'light.css' },
           { name: 'dark', url: 'dark.css' }
         ]
       });
     </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

Remember to replace `"path/to/style-switcher.css"` and `"path/to/style-switcher.js"` with the actual paths to your Style Switcher files.  Now, running this HTML should display a Style Switcher allowing you to toggle between light and dark themes.


## Core Functionality

### Switching Styles

The Style Switcher allows users to switch between different stylesheets through its user interface (UI).  By default, the UI provides a selection mechanism (e.g., dropdown, radio buttons) allowing the user to choose a theme.  The selection triggers the `StyleSwitcher` to load the corresponding stylesheet and apply it to the page. The selected style is typically persisted using local storage, ensuring that the user's preference is remembered across sessions.  Programmatically, you can switch styles using the `selectTheme()` method:

```javascript
styleSwitcher.selectTheme('dark'); // Selects the theme named 'dark'
```


### Adding New Stylesheets

New stylesheets can be added dynamically after the Style Switcher has been initialized.  This allows you to add themes without restarting the application.  Use the `addTheme()` method:

```javascript
styleSwitcher.addTheme({ name: 'newTheme', url: 'new-theme.css' });
```

This will add a new option to the Style Switcher's UI, representing the new theme.  The `name` property is displayed to the user, while the `url` points to the new stylesheet.


### Removing Stylesheets

Similarly, you can remove existing stylesheets using the `removeTheme()` method.  This removes the theme option from the UI and unloads the stylesheet if it's currently active:

```javascript
styleSwitcher.removeTheme('light'); // Removes the theme named 'light'
```

Be aware that removing an active theme will switch the page back to the default style or the next available theme.


### Event Handling

The `StyleSwitcher` object emits events that you can listen for to perform actions based on theme changes.  The primary event is `themeChanged`. You can listen to this event using the `addEventListener()` method:

```javascript
styleSwitcher.addEventListener('themeChanged', (event) => {
  console.log('Theme changed to:', event.detail.themeName);
  // Perform any necessary actions, e.g., update UI elements based on the new theme
});
```

The `event.detail.themeName` property contains the name of the newly selected theme.  You can use this information to update other parts of your application accordingly.  [Mention any other relevant events, e.g., `themeAdded`, `themeRemoved`]


### Asynchronous Loading

Stylesheets are loaded asynchronously to prevent blocking the page rendering.  The Style Switcher handles the loading process internally.  The `themeChanged` event is fired *after* the new stylesheet has been successfully loaded and applied.  However, you might want to include a loading indicator in your UI to inform the user that a theme is being switched.  This loading indicator should be hidden after the `themeChanged` event is fired.


## Advanced Usage

### Customizing the Switching Mechanism

The default Style Switcher UI provides a simple selection mechanism (e.g., dropdown, radio buttons). You can customize this by providing a custom rendering function during initialization.  This function receives the available themes as an array of objects and should return the HTML for your custom UI.  The returned HTML should include elements that allow users to select different themes; these elements must have a data attribute `data-theme-name` that matches the `name` property of the themes.  When a user interacts with these elements, the Style Switcher automatically updates the active theme.

For example:

```javascript
const styleSwitcher = new StyleSwitcher({
  containerId: 'style-switcher-container',
  themes: [ /* ... your themes ... */ ],
  renderUI: (themes) => {
    let html = '<ul>';
    themes.forEach(theme => {
      html += `<li><a href="#" data-theme-name="${theme.name}">${theme.name}</a></li>`;
    });
    html += '</ul>';
    return html;
  }
});

```

This example creates an unordered list (`<ul>`) with links (`<a>`) for each theme. Clicking a link triggers the theme switch.  You can adapt this approach to create any custom UI design.


### Using LocalStorage for Persistence

By default, the Style Switcher uses `localStorage` to persist the user's theme selection across sessions. This ensures that the user's preferred theme is loaded when they revisit the website. You can disable this functionality by setting the `useLocalStorage` option to `false` during initialization:

```javascript
const styleSwitcher = new StyleSwitcher({
  containerId: 'style-switcher-container',
  themes: [ /* ... your themes ... */ ],
  useLocalStorage: false // Disables localStorage persistence
});
```

However,  in most cases, leaving `useLocalStorage` enabled is recommended for a better user experience.


### Integration with Other Libraries

The Style Switcher is designed to be compatible with most other JavaScript libraries and frameworks. You can integrate it into your existing projects without significant modifications.  Ensure that you include the Style Switcher's JavaScript and CSS files after any other dependencies that might affect the DOM.  If you encounter conflicts, carefully review the loading order of your scripts and stylesheets.


### Handling Multiple Style Switchers

It is possible to have multiple Style Switcher instances on a single page. Each instance should have a unique `containerId` to avoid conflicts.  Remember to initialize each instance separately with its own configuration:

```javascript
const styleSwitcher1 = new StyleSwitcher({ /* ... configuration for the first switcher ... */ });
const styleSwitcher2 = new StyleSwitcher({ /* ... configuration for the second switcher ... */ });
```


### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance, especially with many themes or large stylesheets:

* **Minimize Stylesheet Size:** Use efficient CSS and minimize unnecessary code in your stylesheets.  Consider using CSS preprocessors (like Sass or Less) for better organization and maintainability.
* **Lazy Loading:** If you have many themes, consider lazy-loading them, fetching only the currently selected theme initially and loading others on demand.
* **Caching:** Implement client-side caching (e.g., using Service Workers) to improve performance by reducing the number of requests needed to load themes.
* **Avoid Blocking:** Ensure that your stylesheet loading is asynchronous, as done by default within the Style Switcher, to prevent blocking the page rendering.




## API Reference

### Style Switcher Constructor

The `StyleSwitcher` constructor initializes a new Style Switcher instance.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
new StyleSwitcher(options)
```

**Parameters:**

* `options` (Object): An object containing configuration options.  The following options are available:

    * `containerId` (String):  The ID of the HTML element where the Style Switcher UI will be rendered.  **Required.**
    * `themes` (Array): An array of theme objects. Each theme object must have a `name` (String) and a `url` (String) property.  **Required.**
    * `useLocalStorage` (Boolean):  Whether to use `localStorage` to persist the selected theme. Defaults to `true`.
    * `defaultTheme` (String): The name of the theme to be initially selected.  Defaults to the first theme in the `themes` array.
    * `renderUI` (Function): A custom function to render the Style Switcher's UI. See "Customizing the Switching Mechanism" for details.

**Example:**

```javascript
const styleSwitcher = new StyleSwitcher({
  containerId: 'mySwitcher',
  themes: [
    { name: 'light', url: 'light.css' },
    { name: 'dark', url: 'dark.css' }
  ],
  defaultTheme: 'dark'
});
```


### Methods

* `selectTheme(themeName)`: Selects the theme with the given name.
* `addTheme(theme)`: Adds a new theme. The `theme` parameter is an object with `name` and `url` properties.
* `removeTheme(themeName)`: Removes the theme with the given name.
* `addEventListener(eventName, listener)`: Adds an event listener.
* `removeEventListener(eventName, listener)`: Removes an event listener.
* `getTheme():` Returns the currently active theme's name.


### Events

* `themeChanged`: Fired when the selected theme changes. The event detail object contains a `themeName` property with the name of the new theme.


### Properties

The `StyleSwitcher` object doesn't expose public properties directly for modification.  The active theme can be retrieved using the `getTheme()` method.  Direct manipulation of internal properties is discouraged, as it might lead to unexpected behavior and break functionality.  The API is designed to be used through the methods described above to ensure consistent and predictable operation.



## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Style Switcher not appearing:**  Double-check that you've correctly included the Style Switcher's CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML. Verify that the `containerId` you provided in the constructor matches the ID of an existing element in your HTML. Inspect your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.
* **Themes not loading:** Ensure that the paths to your stylesheets in the `themes` array are correct and that the stylesheets exist. Check your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to see if the stylesheets are being requested and loaded successfully. If using a web server, make sure the server is configured correctly to serve the files.
* **Theme not persisting:** If the selected theme is not saved across sessions, verify that `localStorage` is enabled in your browser and that there are no browser restrictions preventing it from being used. Check the `useLocalStorage` option in the constructor – it might be accidentally set to `false`.
* **Custom UI not working:** If you are implementing a custom UI using `renderUI`, ensure that the HTML elements you generate have the correct `data-theme-name` attributes matching your theme names.  Inspect the generated HTML to make sure the structure and attributes are as expected.


### Debugging Tips

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript related to the Style Switcher. The console will show any JavaScript errors, and the network tab can be used to verify that stylesheets are loading correctly.
* **Console Logging:** Add `console.log` statements to your code to track the values of variables and the flow of execution. This can help pinpoint where problems are occurring.  For example, log the `themes` array to check if it's correctly populated.
* **Simplify:** If you are facing complex issues, try simplifying your setup by creating a minimal example with just one or two themes. This can help to isolate the problem and identify the root cause.


### Error Handling

The Style Switcher includes basic error handling.  However, it's important to handle potential errors such as network issues when loading stylesheets.  You can listen to the `themeChanged` event and check the `event.detail` object for any error messages provided by the Style Switcher.  In a production environment, you should implement robust error handling to gracefully degrade and provide informative feedback to the user in case of issues.  For example, displaying an appropriate message if a stylesheet fails to load.


### FAQ

* **Q: Can I use this with React, Angular, or Vue?** A: Yes, the Style Switcher is designed to work with any JavaScript framework.  It is a vanilla JavaScript library that doesn’t impose any framework-specific dependencies.  Just make sure to include it correctly in your project's build process.
* **Q: Can I use a different storage mechanism instead of `localStorage`?** A: While `localStorage` is used by default for persistence, you can disable it (`useLocalStorage: false`).  You would then be responsible for implementing your own persistence mechanism, perhaps using a different storage method or making calls to your backend.
* **Q:  How can I add a loading indicator while a theme is switching?** A: Add a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) to your UI. Show it when a theme selection is made and hide it when the `themeChanged` event is fired, signaling that the theme has been successfully loaded.
* **Q: What happens if a stylesheet fails to load?** A:  The Style Switcher will attempt to load the stylesheet. If it fails, the page will retain its previous styling and you might want to add error handling to provide feedback to the user.
* **Q: Can I contribute to the project?** A: [Insert link to project repository if applicable, and contribution guidelines].
