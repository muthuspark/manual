The exact path will be provided (e.g., `<script src=\"path/to/social-likes.js\"></script>`).\n\n2. **Initialize the widget:**  Use JavaScript to initialize the widget, specifying the desired social networks and customization options.  Example code and detailed documentation on available options will be provided.  A basic example might look like:\n\n   ```javascript\n   SocialLikes.init({\n       networks: ['facebook', 'twitter'],\n       url: 'your-page-url',\n       title: 'Your Page Title'\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. **Add the HTML placeholder:**  Insert a `<div>` element in your HTML where you want the widget to appear.  The `id` attribute of this div will be referenced during initialization (e.g., `<div id=\"social-likes\"></div>`).\n\n4. **Customize (Optional):**  Explore the available customization options to tailor the widget's appearance and functionality.  Refer to the customization section of this manual for detailed instructions.\n\n5. **Test and Deploy:** Thoroughly test the integration on your website to ensure it functions correctly.  Once satisfied, deploy your changes.\n\n\n## Installation and Setup\n\n### Installing via npm or yarn\n\nSocial Likes can be easily integrated into your project using npm or yarn.  First, ensure you have Node.js and either npm or yarn installed on your system.  Then, open your project's terminal and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install social-likes-widget  //or\nyarn add social-likes-widget\n```\n\nThis will install the Social Likes package into your project's `node_modules` directory.  You can then import it into your JavaScript code using the appropriate module import syntax (e.g., `import SocialLikes from 'social-likes-widget';`  or `const SocialLikes = require('social-likes-widget');`).  Refer to the specific documentation for your bundler (Webpack, Parcel, Rollup, etc.) for details on how to configure it to work with your project.\n\n\n### Including via CDN\n\nFor a quicker setup, you can include Social Likes using a CDN.  We provide a CDN link (insert actual CDN link here, e.g., `https://cdn.example.com/social-likes.min.js`).  Add the following `<script>` tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.example.com/social-likes.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThis method is suitable for projects where you don't need to manage the library through a package manager.  However, note that updates might be slightly slower compared to using npm or yarn.\n\n\n### Basic Setup\n\nAfter installing or including Social Likes, you need to initialize the widget with basic configuration.  This involves creating a container element in your HTML and then using JavaScript to initialize the widget with the necessary parameters.\n\nFirst, add a `div` element to your HTML where you want the social sharing buttons to appear:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"social-likes\"></div>\n```\n\nThen, use JavaScript to initialize the widget.  The following code provides a basic example:\n\n```javascript\nconst SocialLikes = require('social-likes-widget'); // or import as appropriate from your bundler\n\nSocialLikes.init({\n    target: 'social-likes', // ID of your container element\n    url: window.location.href, // URL of the current page\n    title: document.title // Title of the current page\n});\n\n```\n\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nSocial Likes offers extensive customization options. The `init()` method accepts an object with the following key-value pairs:\n\n\n* **`target` (String, Required):** The ID of the HTML element where the widget will be rendered. (e.g., `'social-likes'`)\n\n* **`url` (String, Required):** The URL of the content being shared.  If omitted, it defaults to the current page URL.\n\n* **`title` (String, Required):** The title of the content being shared. If omitted, it defaults to the document title.\n\n* **`networks` (Array, Optional):** An array of social network names to include.  Supported networks are: ['facebook', 'twitter', 'linkedin', 'pinterest', etc. - list all supported networks here]. Defaults to all available networks if omitted.  (Example: `['facebook', 'twitter']`)\n\n* **`counters` (Boolean, Optional):**  Whether to display like/share counters.  Defaults to `true`.\n\n* **`theme` (String, Optional):** The theme to apply to the widget. (e.g., 'light', 'dark' - list available themes). Defaults to a default theme.\n\n* **`size` (String, Optional):** The size of the buttons. (e.g., 'small', 'medium', 'large'). Defaults to 'medium'.\n\n* **`locale` (String, Optional):** The locale to use for the widget. Defaults to the browser's locale. (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr')\n\n* **`language` (String, Optional):** (If needed)  The language code to be used for the widget.\n\n\n*(Add further configuration options as needed, specifying data type and a clear description of each option. Include examples where applicable.)*\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### SocialLikes Object\n\nThe core of the Social Likes library is the `SocialLikes` object.  This object provides methods for initializing, updating, and destroying the widget, as well as handling events.  The object is accessible after the library is loaded, either via a CDN or a module import.\n\n### init() Method\n\nThe `init()` method is used to initialize the Social Likes widget.  It takes a single argument: a configuration object.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.init(config);\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `config` (Object): An object containing the widget's configuration options (see \"Configuration Options\" section in the Installation and Setup guide for a detailed list).\n\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns the `SocialLikes` instance, allowing method chaining.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.init({\n    target: 'social-likes',\n    url: 'https://www.example.com',\n    title: 'Example Page',\n    networks: ['facebook', 'twitter']\n});\n```\n\n\n### render() Method\n\nThe `render()` method forces a re-render of the widget. This is useful if you've made changes to the configuration after initialization and want to reflect those changes visually.  It doesn't take any parameters.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.render();\n```\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns the `SocialLikes` instance, allowing method chaining.\n\n\n### update() Method\n\nThe `update()` method allows you to dynamically update the widget's configuration after initialization. It takes a single argument, a configuration object containing the properties you want to change.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.update(config);\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `config` (Object):  An object containing the properties to update. Only the properties specified in this object will be changed.\n\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns the `SocialLikes` instance, allowing method chaining.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.update({ title: 'Updated Page Title' });\n```\n\n\n### destroy() Method\n\nThe `destroy()` method removes the Social Likes widget from the DOM and releases any resources it's using.  This is useful for cleaning up when the widget is no longer needed.  It doesn't take any parameters.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.destroy();\n```\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns `undefined`.\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nThe `SocialLikes` object allows you to listen for custom events triggered by the widget.  Currently supported events include:\n\n* **`socialLikes.initialized`:** Fired when the widget is successfully initialized.\n* **`socialLikes.updated`:** Fired when the widget is updated using the `update()` method.\n* **`socialLikes.share`:** Fired when a user clicks a share button.  The event object will contain details about which network was shared to. (Further details to be added here – event object structure)\n\nYou can add event listeners using the standard `addEventListener` method:\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.addEventListener('socialLikes.share', (event) => {\n    console.log('Share event:', event);\n});\n```\n\n\n### Customizing the UI\n\n(This section should describe how to customize the UI.  This might involve CSS customization, providing custom templates or specifying options within the config object to alter button styles, colors, etc.  Provide clear examples and instructions.)  For example:  You can customize the appearance of the buttons using CSS selectors targeting the widget's elements.  Specific CSS class names should be documented here.\n\n\n### Supported Social Networks\n\nThe Social Likes widget currently supports the following social networks:  (List all supported networks here,  e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, etc.)  Support for additional networks may be added in future versions.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Styling Options\n\nSocial Likes provides several ways to customize its appearance to match your website's design.  The primary method is through CSS.  The widget uses a set of CSS classes that you can target to modify its visual elements.  These classes are documented below.  Remember to include your custom CSS *after* including the Social Likes CSS file to ensure your styles override the default ones.\n\n**Key CSS Classes:**\n\n* `.social-likes`:  The main container for the entire widget.\n* `.social-likes__button`:  A general class for all social buttons.\n* `.social-likes__button--facebook`:  Specific class for the Facebook button. (Repeat this for each network – e.g., `--twitter`, `--linkedin`, etc.)\n* `.social-likes__counter`:  The container for the like/share count.\n\n\n**Example CSS Customization:**\n\nTo change the background color of all buttons to light blue:\n\n```css\n.social-likes__button {\n  background-color: lightblue;\n}\n```\n\nTo change the color of the Facebook button text to white:\n\n```css\n.social-likes__button--facebook {\n  color: white;\n}\n```\n\n*(Add more examples targeting different elements and properties of the widget as needed.)*\n\n\n### Custom Icons\n\nWhile Social Likes provides default icons for each supported social network, you can replace them with your own custom icons.  This is accomplished by using the `customIcons` option within the `init()` method configuration.  This option accepts an object where keys are the network names (matching the `networks` array) and values are the URLs of your custom icon images.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.init({\n  // ... other configuration options ...\n  customIcons: {\n    facebook: 'path/to/your/facebook-icon.svg',\n    twitter: 'path/to/your/twitter-icon.png'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nEnsure your custom icons are appropriately sized and formatted for optimal display.\n\n\n### Custom Templates\n\nFor advanced customization, you can override the default HTML templates used to render the widget. This allows for complete control over the widget's structure and content.  (Further detailed explanation and examples of how to provide custom templates will need to be provided here, showing how to structure the custom template HTML and how to specify it in the configuration.)  This might involve specifying a function that returns the custom HTML, or a string containing the custom HTML.  The exact method will be documented here with clear examples.\n\n\n### Language Support\n\nSocial Likes supports multiple languages. You can specify the language using the `locale` or `language` option (depending on implementation) within the `init()` method configuration.  Supported locales/languages will be specified here.  (List all supported locales/languages here, e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr', etc.  Explain how to use locale codes to select language).  If your required language is not included, you will need to provide translations for the relevant strings.  (Explain how to provide custom translations, if this functionality is available).\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Integrating with Other Libraries\n\nSocial Likes is designed to be compatible with most JavaScript frameworks and libraries.  However, specific integration steps might be required depending on the library used.\n\n**React:**  You can integrate Social Likes into a React application by using the `useEffect` hook to initialize the widget after the component mounts and clean up with the `cleanup` function within `useEffect`.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\nimport SocialLikes from 'social-likes-widget';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const containerRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    SocialLikes.init({\n      target: containerRef.current,\n      url: 'https://www.example.com',\n      title: 'Example Page'\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n      SocialLikes.destroy(); // Clean up on unmount\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={containerRef} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**(Add similar examples for other popular frameworks like Vue.js, Angular, etc.  Adjust the example code as needed for each framework.)**  Note that specific integration instructions might vary based on the chosen framework and bundling tools.  Consult the documentation for your specific framework for details on integrating third-party libraries.\n\n\n### Handling Errors\n\nSocial Likes includes built-in error handling.  However, for robust error management, you should implement custom error handling in your application.  This may involve using `try...catch` blocks around the initialization and other API calls, or using promise error handling if applicable.  The `SocialLikes` object might provide specific error events (if applicable - specify here).  You can listen for these events to handle specific error conditions.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nTo optimize the performance of Social Likes:\n\n* **Asynchronous Loading:** Load the Social Likes script asynchronously to avoid blocking the page's rendering. (Explain how to load asynchronously, e.g., using the `async` attribute in `<script>` tag, or using promises.)\n\n* **Lazy Loading:** Consider lazy loading the widget only when it becomes visible in the viewport.  This can improve the initial page load time, especially for pages with many widgets. (Provide example code or techniques on how to implement lazy loading.)\n\n* **Minimizing API Calls:** Reduce the number of network requests by efficiently managing data fetching and caching.  (Explain how the library manages API calls and if there are ways to further optimize these calls.)\n\n* **Minification and Compression:** Use a minifier to reduce the size of the Social Likes JavaScript file, and consider using a content delivery network (CDN) for faster delivery.\n\n* **Avoid unnecessary re-renders:** Only call the `update()` or `render()` methods when necessary to avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations, enhancing rendering performance.\n\n\n### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\n(This section should detail whether Social Likes supports server-side rendering and, if so, how to integrate it with popular SSR frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, etc.  If it's not supported, clearly state that it's not supported and explain why.)  If SSR is supported, instructions should include how to properly initialize the widget on the client-side after the page renders, avoiding potential issues with dynamic content and ensuring the widget functions correctly.  This usually involves checking if the widget is already rendered on the server and then initializing it only on the client-side after hydration.  Example code should be provided.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Widget not appearing:**  Verify that the JavaScript file is correctly included and that the `init()` method is called with the correct `target` ID matching your HTML element.  Check your browser's console for JavaScript errors.  Ensure the container element exists in the DOM before the widget is initialized.\n\n* **Incorrect counters:** Check that the `url` and `title` parameters in the `init()` method are accurate. Incorrect URLs or titles can lead to inaccurate count retrieval.  Ensure the APIs for the social networks are accessible.\n\n* **Styling issues:** Ensure your custom CSS is included after the Social Likes CSS and that your selectors are correctly targeting the widget's elements.  Check for CSS conflicts. Inspect the widget's elements using your browser's developer tools to identify any conflicting styles.\n\n* **Share buttons not working:** Verify that the necessary social network APIs are properly configured and that the user is logged into the respective social networks in their browser.  Network connectivity issues can also cause problems.\n\n* **Errors in console:** Check your browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12) for any JavaScript errors related to Social Likes. These errors will often provide clues to the source of the problem.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The browser's developer tools provide invaluable information for debugging JavaScript and CSS issues. Use them to inspect the widget's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.\n\n* **Check the network tab:** In your browser's developer tools, examine the Network tab to see if requests to social network APIs are being made and whether they are succeeding.\n\n* **Simplify your configuration:** If you're having trouble with a complex configuration, try simplifying it to test if a specific part of the configuration is causing the problem.\n\n* **Test with a minimal example:** Create a minimal HTML file with just the essential elements to initialize Social Likes.  This helps to isolate issues caused by other parts of your website.\n\n* **Check for JavaScript conflicts:** Other JavaScript libraries or scripts on your page might conflict with Social Likes. Try disabling other scripts temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n* **Consult the browser's console:**  The browser's console may report errors or warnings that indicate the problem's cause.\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n*(This section should contain a list of frequently asked questions and their answers.  Examples include:*\n\n* **Q: How do I change the color of the buttons?**  A: You can modify the button colors using CSS by targeting specific classes within the Social Likes styles.  (Refer to the \"Styling Options\" section.)\n\n* **Q: What social networks are supported?** A:  (List the supported networks.)\n\n* **Q:  How do I update the counter values?** A:  The counter values are updated automatically. If you need to force a refresh, call the `update()` method, but ensure you update the `url` and/or `title` if content changed.\n\n* **Q:  Why aren't my custom icons displaying?**  A: Ensure the file paths in `customIcons` are correct and the files exist. Check for errors in the console.\n\n* **Q: My widget isn't working after implementing SSR.** A: (Provide a solution if SSR is supported, or explain the lack of SSR support).\n\n\n*(Add more FAQs based on common user issues and questions.)*\n\n\n### Support Resources\n\n* **Documentation:**  This developer manual.\n\n* **Example Code:** (Provide links to examples or code repositories)\n\n* **Issue Tracker:** (Provide a link to the issue tracker, if available)\n\n* **Community Forum/Support:** (Provide links to community forums or support channels, if available)\n\n* **Contact Email:** (Provide a contact email address, if appropriate)\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to Social Likes!

Include examples where applicable.)*\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### SocialLikes Object\n\nThe core of the Social Likes library is the `SocialLikes` object.  This object provides methods for initializing, updating, and destroying the widget, as well as handling events.  The object is accessible after the library is loaded, either via a CDN or a module import.\n\n### init() Method\n\nThe `init()` method is used to initialize the Social Likes widget.  It takes a single argument: a configuration object.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.init(config);\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `config` (Object): An object containing the widget's configuration options (see \"Configuration Options\" section in the Installation and Setup guide for a detailed list).\n\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns the `SocialLikes` instance, allowing method chaining.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.init({\n    target: 'social-likes',\n    url: 'https://www.example.com',\n    title: 'Example Page',\n    networks: ['facebook', 'twitter']\n});\n```\n\n\n### render() Method\n\nThe `render()` method forces a re-render of the widget. This is useful if you've made changes to the configuration after initialization and want to reflect those changes visually.  It doesn't take any parameters.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.render();\n```\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns the `SocialLikes` instance, allowing method chaining.\n\n\n### update() Method\n\nThe `update()` method allows you to dynamically update the widget's configuration after initialization. It takes a single argument, a configuration object containing the properties you want to change.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.update(config);\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n* `config` (Object):  An object containing the properties to update. Only the properties specified in this object will be changed.\n\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns the `SocialLikes` instance, allowing method chaining.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.update({ title: 'Updated Page Title' });\n```\n\n\n### destroy() Method\n\nThe `destroy()` method removes the Social Likes widget from the DOM and releases any resources it's using.  This is useful for cleaning up when the widget is no longer needed.  It doesn't take any parameters.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.destroy();\n```\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nReturns `undefined`.\n\n\n### Event Handling\n\nThe `SocialLikes` object allows you to listen for custom events triggered by the widget.  Currently supported events include:\n\n* **`socialLikes.initialized`:** Fired when the widget is successfully initialized.\n* **`socialLikes.updated`:** Fired when the widget is updated using the `update()` method.\n* **`socialLikes.share`:** Fired when a user clicks a share button.  The event object will contain details about which network was shared to. (Further details to be added here – event object structure)\n\nYou can add event listeners using the standard `addEventListener` method:\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.addEventListener('socialLikes.share', (event) => {\n    console.log('Share event:', event);\n});\n```\n\n\n### Customizing the UI\n\n(This section should describe how to customize the UI.  This might involve CSS customization, providing custom templates or specifying options within the config object to alter button styles, colors, etc.  Provide clear examples and instructions.)  For example:  You can customize the appearance of the buttons using CSS selectors targeting the widget's elements.  Specific CSS class names should be documented here.\n\n\n### Supported Social Networks\n\nThe Social Likes widget currently supports the following social networks:  (List all supported networks here,  e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, etc.)  Support for additional networks may be added in future versions.\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Styling Options\n\nSocial Likes provides several ways to customize its appearance to match your website's design.  The primary method is through CSS.  The widget uses a set of CSS classes that you can target to modify its visual elements.  These classes are documented below.  Remember to include your custom CSS *after* including the Social Likes CSS file to ensure your styles override the default ones.\n\n**Key CSS Classes:**\n\n* `.social-likes`:  The main container for the entire widget.\n* `.social-likes__button`:  A general class for all social buttons.\n* `.social-likes__button--facebook`:  Specific class for the Facebook button. (Repeat this for each network – e.g., `--twitter`, `--linkedin`, etc.)\n* `.social-likes__counter`:  The container for the like/share count.\n\n\n**Example CSS Customization:**\n\nTo change the background color of all buttons to light blue:\n\n```css\n.social-likes__button {\n  background-color: lightblue;\n}\n```\n\nTo change the color of the Facebook button text to white:\n\n```css\n.social-likes__button--facebook {\n  color: white;\n}\n```\n\n*(Add more examples targeting different elements and properties of the widget as needed.)*\n\n\n### Custom Icons\n\nWhile Social Likes provides default icons for each supported social network, you can replace them with your own custom icons.  This is accomplished by using the `customIcons` option within the `init()` method configuration.  This option accepts an object where keys are the network names (matching the `networks` array) and values are the URLs of your custom icon images.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nSocialLikes.init({\n  // ... other configuration options ...\n  customIcons: {\n    facebook: 'path/to/your/facebook-icon.svg',\n    twitter: 'path/to/your/twitter-icon.png'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nEnsure your custom icons are appropriately sized and formatted for optimal display.\n\n\n### Custom Templates\n\nFor advanced customization, you can override the default HTML templates used to render the widget. This allows for complete control over the widget's structure and content.  (Further detailed explanation and examples of how to provide custom templates will need to be provided here, showing how to structure the custom template HTML and how to specify it in the configuration.)  This might involve specifying a function that returns the custom HTML, or a string containing the custom HTML.  The exact method will be documented here with clear examples.\n\n\n### Language Support\n\nSocial Likes supports multiple languages. You can specify the language using the `locale` or `language` option (depending on implementation) within the `init()` method configuration.  Supported locales/languages will be specified here.  (List all supported locales/languages here, e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr', etc.  Explain how to use locale codes to select language).  If your required language is not included, you will need to provide translations for the relevant strings.  (Explain how to provide custom translations, if this functionality is available).\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Integrating with Other Libraries\n\nSocial Likes is designed to be compatible with most JavaScript frameworks and libraries.  However, specific integration steps might be required depending on the library used.\n\n**React:**  You can integrate Social Likes into a React application by using the `useEffect` hook to initialize the widget after the component mounts and clean up with the `cleanup` function within `useEffect`.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\nimport SocialLikes from 'social-likes-widget';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const containerRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    SocialLikes.init({\n      target: containerRef.current,\n      url: 'https://www.example.com',\n      title: 'Example Page'\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n      SocialLikes.destroy(); // Clean up on unmount\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={containerRef} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**(Add similar examples for other popular frameworks like Vue.js, Angular, etc.  Adjust the example code as needed for each framework.)**  Note that specific integration instructions might vary based on the chosen framework and bundling tools.  Consult the documentation for your specific framework for details on integrating third-party libraries.\n\n\n### Handling Errors\n\nSocial Likes includes built-in error handling.  However, for robust error management, you should implement custom error handling in your application.  This may involve using `try...catch` blocks around the initialization and other API calls, or using promise error handling if applicable.  The `SocialLikes` object might provide specific error events (if applicable - specify here).  You can listen for these events to handle specific error conditions.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nTo optimize the performance of Social Likes:\n\n* **Asynchronous Loading:** Load the Social Likes script asynchronously to avoid blocking the page's rendering. (Explain how to load asynchronously, e.g., using the `async` attribute in `<script>` tag, or using promises.)\n\n* **Lazy Loading:** Consider lazy loading the widget only when it becomes visible in the viewport.  This can improve the initial page load time, especially for pages with many widgets. (Provide example code or techniques on how to implement lazy loading.)\n\n* **Minimizing API Calls:** Reduce the number of network requests by efficiently managing data fetching and caching.  (Explain how the library manages API calls and if there are ways to further optimize these calls.)\n\n* **Minification and Compression:** Use a minifier to reduce the size of the Social Likes JavaScript file, and consider using a content delivery network (CDN) for faster delivery.\n\n* **Avoid unnecessary re-renders:** Only call the `update()` or `render()` methods when necessary to avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations, enhancing rendering performance.\n\n\n### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n\n(This section should detail whether Social Likes supports server-side rendering and, if so, how to integrate it with popular SSR frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, etc.  If it's not supported, clearly state that it's not supported and explain why.)  If SSR is supported, instructions should include how to properly initialize the widget on the client-side after the page renders, avoiding potential issues with dynamic content and ensuring the widget functions correctly.  This usually involves checking if the widget is already rendered on the server and then initializing it only on the client-side after hydration.  Example code should be provided.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Widget not appearing:**  Verify that the JavaScript file is correctly included and that the `init()` method is called with the correct `target` ID matching your HTML element.  Check your browser's console for JavaScript errors.  Ensure the container element exists in the DOM before the widget is initialized.\n\n* **Incorrect counters:** Check that the `url` and `title` parameters in the `init()` method are accurate. Incorrect URLs or titles can lead to inaccurate count retrieval.  Ensure the APIs for the social networks are accessible.\n\n* **Styling issues:** Ensure your custom CSS is included after the Social Likes CSS and that your selectors are correctly targeting the widget's elements.  Check for CSS conflicts. Inspect the widget's elements using your browser's developer tools to identify any conflicting styles.\n\n* **Share buttons not working:** Verify that the necessary social network APIs are properly configured and that the user is logged into the respective social networks in their browser.  Network connectivity issues can also cause problems.\n\n* **Errors in console:** Check your browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12) for any JavaScript errors related to Social Likes. These errors will often provide clues to the source of the problem.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The browser's developer tools provide invaluable information for debugging JavaScript and CSS issues. Use them to inspect the widget's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.\n\n* **Check the network tab:** In your browser's developer tools, examine the Network tab to see if requests to social network APIs are being made and whether they are succeeding.\n\n* **Simplify your configuration:** If you're having trouble with a complex configuration, try simplifying it to test if a specific part of the configuration is causing the problem.\n\n* **Test with a minimal example:** Create a minimal HTML file with just the essential elements to initialize Social Likes.  This helps to isolate issues caused by other parts of your website.\n\n* **Check for JavaScript conflicts:** Other JavaScript libraries or scripts on your page might conflict with Social Likes. Try disabling other scripts temporarily to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n* **Consult the browser's console:**  The browser's console may report errors or warnings that indicate the problem's cause.\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n*(This section should contain a list of frequently asked questions and their answers.  Examples include:*\n\n* **Q: How do I change the color of the buttons?**  A: You can modify the button colors using CSS by targeting specific classes within the Social Likes styles.  (Refer to the \"Styling Options\" section.)\n\n* **Q: What social networks are supported?** A:  (List the supported networks.)\n\n* **Q:  How do I update the counter values?** A:  The counter values are updated automatically.
