### Setting up your Development Environment

To start developing with skelJS, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  You'll also need a code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom) and a web browser.  There are no specific dependencies or complex build processes required.

1. **Download skelJS:** Download the latest version of skelJS from [insert download link here].  This will typically be a single JavaScript file (e.g., `skel.js`).

2. **Include in your HTML:**  Include the `skel.js` file in your HTML document using a `<script>` tag, ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My skelJS App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your application content here -->

  <script src="skel.js"></script>  </body>
</html>
```

3. **Start Coding:** You can now start writing your skelJS code.  Refer to the documentation and API reference for details on using the framework's features.  The core functionality is readily accessible and well-documented, simplifying the development process.


## Core Concepts

### The skelJS Object Model

skelJS utilizes a straightforward object model.  At its heart lies a global `skel` object, which provides access to all of the framework's core functionalities and utilities.  This object is organized into namespaces for better structure and maintainability.  For instance, DOM manipulation functions might reside within `skel.dom`, event handling within `skel.events`, etc.  This modular design promotes code clarity and prevents namespace collisions.  Each function within these namespaces is carefully designed for simplicity and readability.  The `skel` object is the single entry point for interacting with the entire framework.

### Components and their Lifecycle

skelJS components are reusable building blocks for your application.  They are essentially JavaScript objects that encapsulate specific functionality and associated data.  While skelJS doesn't enforce a strict component architecture like some larger frameworks, the recommended approach is to create components that manage their own internal state and behavior.  A typical component lifecycle might include:

* **Initialization:**  The component is created and initialized with its initial data and configuration.
* **Rendering:**  The component renders its user interface (UI) to the DOM.  This could involve creating elements, populating them with data, and attaching event listeners.
* **Updating:**  The component's UI is updated in response to changes in data or user interactions.
* **Destruction:** The component is removed from the DOM and its resources are released.  This step is important for memory management, especially in larger applications.

While there's no formal lifecycle method like `componentDidMount` in React, developers should design components with these phases in mind for clean code and efficient resource management.


### Data Binding and Reactivity

skelJS doesn't include a built-in, sophisticated data binding system like some other frameworks. However, it provides fundamental tools that allow developers to easily implement their own reactive data management. You would typically use direct DOM manipulation along with event listeners to update the UI in response to data changes.  This approach offers flexibility, but requires a more hands-on approach to managing data flow and updates.  The simplicity of the framework allows you to choose your preferred data management method without constraints imposed by the framework itself.

### Event Handling

skelJS simplifies event handling by providing a consistent and cross-browser compatible API.  The `skel.events` namespace houses functions for attaching and detaching event listeners. These functions typically follow a standard pattern, taking the target element, event type, and a callback function as arguments.  Error handling and efficient event management are prioritized within the event handling system.  This is crucial to preventing memory leaks and maintaining performance even under heavy event load.


### Templating Engine

skelJS does not include a built-in templating engine. Developers are free to use their preferred templating solution (e.g., Handlebars, Mustache, or even simple string manipulation) or to build custom templating functions.  The focus of skelJS is on core functionalities, leaving templating to external libraries or custom implementations tailored to specific project requirements. This promotes flexibility and prevents unnecessary dependencies.


## Component Development

### Creating Components

In skelJS, components are typically created as JavaScript objects or classes.  There's no rigid structure enforced by the framework, allowing for flexibility in component design.  However, a well-structured component should encapsulate its own data, logic, and rendering logic.  A simple component might look like this:

```javascript
const MyComponent = function(options) {
  this.options = options || {}; //Default options
  this.data = this.options.data || {}; // Component Data

  this.render = function() {
    // Create and render UI elements based on 'this.data'
    const element = document.createElement('div');
    element.innerHTML = `<h1>${this.data.title}</h1>`;
    return element;
  }
};

//Example usage
const myComponentInstance = new MyComponent({ data: { title: 'My Component' } });
document.body.appendChild(myComponentInstance.render());
```

This example shows a basic component with data and a render method.  You can expand this to include more complex logic, event handling, and data updates.


### Component Properties and Methods

Component properties hold the component's data and configuration.  Methods define the component's behavior and actions.  Best practice suggests keeping properties private (using closures or conventions) to enhance encapsulation.  Methods should be clearly defined and follow a consistent naming convention for improved readability and maintainability.  The `this` keyword within the component's methods provides access to its properties and internal state.


### Component Composition

skelJS encourages component compositionâ€”building complex components by combining smaller, simpler ones.  This is achieved by instantiating and rendering child components within a parent component's `render` method.  This promotes reusability and simplifies code organization.  For example, a parent component could contain multiple instances of child components, dynamically rendering them based on its internal data.


### Component Styling

skelJS does not impose any specific styling mechanisms. Developers are free to use any CSS methodology, including inline styles, embedded stylesheets, or external stylesheets.  They can use CSS classes, IDs, or any other styling approach.   Consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to improve style management in larger projects.


### Component Lifecycle Hooks

skelJS doesn't provide formal lifecycle hooks like `componentDidMount` or `componentWillUnmount`.  However, you can mimic this behavior by creating custom methods within your components.  For example, a `init()` method could handle initialization tasks, and a `destroy()` method could clean up resources before component removal.  This approach offers flexibility but requires explicit management of the component's lifecycle stages.


### Testing Components

Testing is crucial for component development.  You can use any JavaScript testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Jasmine) to write unit tests for your components.  Focus your tests on verifying component behavior, data handling, and rendering logic.  Use mocking techniques to isolate components during testing, ensuring each test covers only the component's functionality.  Well-structured tests aid in detecting bugs early and maintaining code quality throughout the development process.


## Data Management

### Working with Data Stores

skelJS doesn't provide a built-in data store. Developers are free to choose and implement their preferred data management strategy.  Options include simple JavaScript objects, more structured data models (like classes or interfaces), or external libraries for managing data persistence and synchronization.  The choice depends on the complexity and requirements of your application. For simple applications, a plain JavaScript object might suffice.  For more complex applications, consider using a dedicated state management library (external to skelJS) to handle data flow and updates efficiently.


### Data Binding Techniques

skelJS doesn't enforce a specific data binding mechanism.  Direct DOM manipulation combined with event listeners is the most straightforward approach.  When data changes, you manually update the corresponding DOM elements using functions provided within `skel.dom`.  This approach offers fine-grained control over data updates. For more advanced applications, consider incorporating an external reactive library to simplify the data binding process and improve code maintainability.


### Data Validation

Data validation is essential to maintain data integrity.  Implement validation logic either within your components or using separate validation functions.   JavaScript's built-in validation functions or external validation libraries can be used.  Validation can occur on client-side (before sending data to a server) and server-side (for extra security).  Clear error handling should be incorporated to provide feedback to the user if validation fails.


### Asynchronous Data Handling

Asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching data from a server using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`) are common. skelJS itself doesn't have special features for handling asynchronous operations, relying on standard JavaScript techniques.  Use promises or async/await to manage asynchronous data fetching and updates efficiently. Update the UI only after the asynchronous operation is completed to ensure data consistency.  Employ loading indicators to provide visual feedback to the user during asynchronous operations.


### Data Transformation

Data transformation involves modifying data before it's used within the application.  This might include parsing JSON, formatting dates, or converting data types.  Utilize JavaScript's built-in functions or external libraries like Lodash to perform data transformations efficiently.  Consider creating reusable data transformation functions to improve code maintainability.  Perform data transformations before displaying data in the UI to ensure consistency and correctness.


## Advanced Topics

### Routing and Navigation

skelJS does not include a built-in routing system.  For routing and navigation, you'll need to use a separate routing library, such as:

* **History.js:** A robust library for managing the browser's history and creating client-side routing.
* **Page.js:** A lightweight library focused on simplifying page transitions and routing.
* **Other Routing Libraries:**  Many other JavaScript routing libraries are available, offering various features and complexities.

You would integrate your chosen routing library with skelJS components to manage navigation and UI updates based on the current route.  This approach provides flexibility, as you can select the routing solution best suited to your application's needs.


### State Management

skelJS itself doesn't provide a dedicated state management solution.   For managing application state, consider these approaches:

* **Simple JavaScript Objects/Classes:** Suitable for small applications with simple state.
* **External State Management Libraries:** Libraries like Redux, MobX, or Zustand offer more sophisticated state management capabilities, particularly for larger and more complex applications.  These libraries would be integrated alongside skelJS, not as part of the framework itself.

The choice of state management strategy will depend on the scale and complexity of your application's state.


### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

skelJS is primarily designed for client-side rendering.  SSR is not directly supported by the framework.  If SSR is needed, you would need to integrate skelJS with a server-side framework (like Node.js with Express.js or similar) and manage the rendering process manually.  This requires a more complex setup, but it offers potential SEO and performance benefits.


### Integration with other Libraries

skelJS's lightweight design makes it easy to integrate with other JavaScript libraries.  You can incorporate libraries for UI components (e.g., React, Vue, or custom component libraries), state management, UI interactions, and more.  The absence of strict architectural constraints in skelJS allows seamless integration with various external tools.  Carefully choose compatible libraries to avoid conflicts and optimize application performance.


### Performance Optimization

To optimize skelJS application performance:

* **Minimize DOM manipulations:** Use efficient DOM manipulation techniques offered by `skel.dom` to reduce the number of updates.
* **Use efficient data structures:** Select appropriate data structures to improve data access and manipulation.
* **Optimize images and assets:** Use optimized images and compress assets to reduce loading times.
* **Lazy loading:** Implement lazy loading of components or resources to improve initial load time.
* **Code splitting:**  If your application is large, consider code splitting to load only necessary code modules.
* **Profiling:** Utilize browser developer tools to profile your application and identify performance bottlenecks.

These techniques will improve your application's responsiveness and efficiency.


### Debugging and Troubleshooting

Use your browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools) to debug your skelJS applications.  The browser's console provides valuable information about errors, warnings, and other events.  Use breakpoints to step through your code and examine variables.  The simplicity of skelJS generally simplifies debugging.  However, ensure well-structured code and effective use of comments to aid in debugging complex sections.  Consider using a dedicated debugging library if required.


## API Reference

This section provides a detailed overview of the skelJS API.  Note that the actual API may vary depending on the version of skelJS you are using. Always refer to the most up-to-date documentation for the specific version.  Example usages are provided for illustrative purposes and may require adjustments based on your project setup.


### skelJS Object

The `skel` object is the central point of access for all skelJS functionalities.  It is a global object and doesn't need to be imported.

* **`skel.version`:** (String) Returns the current version of skelJS.  Example: `console.log(skel.version);`

* **`skel.dom`:** (Object) Contains functions for DOM manipulation.  (Detailed in the next section)

* **`skel.events`:** (Object) Provides functions for event handling.  (Detailed in the next section)

* **`skel.utils`:** (Object) Includes various utility functions. (Detailed in the next section)


### Component API

While skelJS doesn't enforce a strict component architecture, the following functions (or similar) might be included within `skel.dom`  (or a custom component management system) to facilitate component management:


* **`skel.dom.createElement(tagName, attributes, children)`:** Creates a DOM element. `tagName` is the element type (e.g., 'div', 'p').  `attributes` is an object of attributes (e.g., `{id: 'myElement', class: 'myClass'}`). `children` is an array of child nodes or strings.
* **`skel.dom.appendChild(parent, child)`:** Appends a child node to a parent node.
* **`skel.dom.removeChild(parent, child)`:** Removes a child node from a parent node.
* **`skel.dom.replaceChild(parent, newChild, oldChild)`:** Replaces a child node with a new one.
* **`skel.dom.addClass(element, className)`:** Adds a CSS class to an element.
* **`skel.dom.removeClass(element, className)`:** Removes a CSS class from an element.
* **`skel.dom.toggleClass(element, className)`:** Toggles a CSS class on an element.
* **`skel.dom.querySelector(selector, context)`:** Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
* **`skel.dom.querySelectorAll(selector, context)`:** Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.
* **`skel.dom.setTextContent(element, text)`:** Sets the text content of an element.  (Note:  This is a simplified representation, the actual implementation may handle HTML sanitization for security reasons).


### Data Management API

As skelJS doesn't enforce a specific data management structure, there's no dedicated "Data Management API."  Data handling is typically done through plain JavaScript objects, supplemented by external libraries if required.


### Utility Functions

The `skel.utils` namespace (or similar) might include commonly used helper functions:

* **`skel.utils.isArray(value)`:** Checks if a value is an array.
* **`skel.utils.isObject(value)`:** Checks if a value is an object.
* **`skel.utils.isFunction(value)`:** Checks if a value is a function.
* **`skel.utils.extend(target, ...sources)`:** Extends an object with properties from other objects.  Similar to Lodash's `_.extend`.
* **`skel.utils.debounce(func, wait)`:** Debounces a function, limiting the rate at which it can be called.
* **`skel.utils.throttle(func, wait)`:** Throttles a function, limiting the rate at which it can be called.
* **`skel.utils.uuid()`:** Generates a unique identifier.


**Note:** This API reference provides a general overview. The specific functions and their parameters might differ depending on the exact version of skelJS.  Always check the latest documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.


## Examples and Tutorials

These examples demonstrate various aspects of skelJS development.  Remember that the exact API calls and structures may vary slightly depending on the skelJS version.  Consult the API Reference section for the most up-to-date information.


### Simple Component Example

This example shows a simple button component that toggles a message:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>skelJS Simple Component</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="message"></div>
  <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

  <script>
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
    const messageDiv = document.getElementById('message');
    let messageVisible = false;

    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
      messageVisible = !messageVisible;
      const message = messageVisible ? 'Hello from skelJS!' : '';
      messageDiv.textContent = message;
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This example uses only basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation; no specialized skelJS components are explicitly used, demonstrating the framework's flexibility for simple cases.


### Complex Component Example

This example simulates a more complex component, a simple to-do list:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>skelJS To-Do List</title>
</head>
<body>
  <input type="text" id="newTask" placeholder="Add a task">
  <button id="addTask">Add Task</button>
  <ul id="taskList"></ul>

  <script>
    const newTaskInput = document.getElementById('newTask');
    const addTaskButton = document.getElementById('addTask');
    const taskList = document.getElementById('taskList');
    const tasks = [];

    addTaskButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
      const task = newTaskInput.value.trim();
      if (task) {
        tasks.push(task);
        renderTaskList();
        newTaskInput.value = '';
      }
    });

    const renderTaskList = () => {
      taskList.innerHTML = ''; // Clear the list
      tasks.forEach(task => {
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.textContent = task;
        taskList.appendChild(li);
      });
    };
  </script>
</body>
</html>

```

This example demonstrates managing an array of tasks and dynamically updating the UI. Again, it's a basic example not utilizing a formally defined skelJS component structure.


### Integration Example

This example illustrates how to integrate a hypothetical external library for animations (replace with your chosen library):

```javascript
// Assume 'animationLibrary' is an external library providing animation functions.

// ... (other code) ...

const myElement = document.getElementById('myElement');

animationLibrary.animate(myElement, {
  opacity: [1, 0],
  duration: 1000
});

```

This shows how easily external libraries integrate with skelJS's DOM manipulation.


### Advanced Usage Example

This example demonstrates a more sophisticated scenario (replace placeholders with actual skelJS API calls if they exist):


```javascript
// Hypothetical advanced usage, replace with actual skelJS API calls
// This shows a hypothetical approach to component management

const myComponent = skel.createComponent({
  template: '<div>My Component</div>',
  data: { message: 'Hello!' },
  methods: {
    updateMessage: function(newMessage){
      this.data.message = newMessage;
      // Hypothetical function to update the DOM
      skel.dom.updateComponent(this);
    }
  }
});

const componentInstance = new myComponent();
document.body.appendChild(componentInstance.render());
componentInstance.updateMessage('World!');

```

This example showcases a hypothetical component structure with data and methods, which may (or may not) align perfectly with a future version of skelJS depending on the framework's evolution.  Remember to adapt these examples using actual skelJS APIs from the most current documentation.
