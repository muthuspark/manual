Click and hold the image you want to move, drag it to its new position, and release the mouse button.  The order of images will be updated accordingly.  This change will be immediately reflected in the preview (if one is currently open).\n\n\n### Image Formatting Options\n\nWhile Camera Slideshow's primary focus is slideshow creation, basic image formatting options are available. These options may be accessed by selecting an image within the timeline. Right-clicking on a selected image may reveal a contextual menu containing these options, or they may be accessed through a dedicated panel. Currently supported options include:\n\n* **Cropping:** Crop the image to remove unwanted portions.  A cropping tool with adjustable boundaries will appear for precise cropping.\n* **Resizing:** Resize the image to a specific width and height, maintaining the aspect ratio or allowing for distortion.  Options to resize using percentages or pixel values will be provided.\n* **Rotation:** Rotate the image clockwise or counter-clockwise by 90-degree increments.\n\n\n\n\n## Slideshow Configuration\n\n### Transition Effects\n\nCamera Slideshow offers a variety of transition effects to smoothly move between images in the slideshow. These effects are selectable on a per-transition basis (between each image pair) or a global setting that applies to all transitions within the slideshow.  The available transition effects include, but are not limited to: fade, wipe, slide, crossfade, and zoom. Each transition effect has its own visual characteristics and timing.  The specific list of available effects and their visual representation can be found in the application's settings or documentation.\n\n\n### Transition Speed\n\nThe speed of each transition effect can be adjusted.  This setting controls how quickly the transition occurs between images.  Transition speed is typically measured in seconds or milliseconds.  The user can specify a global transition speed that applies to all transitions, or define custom speeds for individual transitions.  A preview feature allows users to see the effect of changing the transition speed before finalizing the setting.\n\n\n### Looping\n\nLooping is a feature that allows the slideshow to automatically restart from the beginning once it reaches the end. This setting can be enabled or disabled in the slideshow configuration. When enabled, the slideshow will continuously play until manually stopped by the user. This functionality is useful for situations where continuous playback is desired, such as digital signage or presentations in a loop.\n\n\n### Autoplay\n\nAutoplay enables the slideshow to begin playing automatically upon launch. When enabled, the slideshow will start playing without user intervention. This option is typically found in the slideshow configuration settings and can be toggled on or off.  This feature enhances usability by starting the slideshow immediately, eliminating the need for a manual play command.\n\n\n### Slideshow Duration\n\nThe overall duration of the slideshow can be estimated based on the number of images, the duration of each image display, and the transition speeds. A precise calculation of the duration can be displayed to the user before the slideshow starts. While users can adjust the duration of individual image displays, the overall duration is determined by the sum of these individual durations plus the transition times.\n\n\n### Full-Screen Mode\n\nFull-screen mode allows the slideshow to be displayed across the entire screen, maximizing the viewing experience.  Activating full-screen mode hides all application controls and maximizes the image display area. This mode provides an immersive viewing experience without distractions from the application's interface. Full-screen mode is typically toggled on or off using a dedicated button or menu option.\n\n\n### Customizing Navigation Controls\n\nWhile basic navigation controls (play/pause, previous/next) are provided by default, some level of customization may be available. This could include options to:\n\n* **Hide/Show Controls:** Users might be able to hide the controls entirely during playback for a cleaner, more immersive experience.\n* **Customize Control Appearance:**  The visual style of the control buttons (size, color, shape) could be customizable to match the theme or branding of the slideshow.\n* **Add Custom Controls:**  More advanced versions of the software might allow developers to add custom controls to extend functionality (e.g., a button to jump to a specific image).  The API for achieving this should be clearly documented.\n\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Adding Captions to Images\n\nCamera Slideshow allows users to add captions or text overlays to individual images within the slideshow.  This feature enhances the presentation by providing additional context or information related to each image.  Captions can be added through a dedicated text input field associated with each image in the timeline.  Users can customize the text font, size, color, position, and style of the caption to match the overall aesthetic of the slideshow.  The application should provide tools for easy alignment and placement of captions on the image.\n\n### Using External APIs for Image Sources\n\nFor advanced users, Camera Slideshow may offer integration with external APIs to fetch images from various online sources. This functionality opens up possibilities for dynamic slideshow creation, where images are sourced from external databases, image repositories, or social media platforms.  The application will need to provide a mechanism for specifying API endpoints, authentication credentials, and data parsing parameters.  Error handling and robust security measures are crucial for this feature to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity. Clear documentation of supported API types and data formats is essential.\n\n\n### Integrating with Other JavaScript Libraries\n\nIf Camera Slideshow is a web-based application, developers may want to integrate it with other JavaScript libraries to enhance functionality or customize the user interface.  This could involve integrating with charting libraries to display data visualizations alongside images, using UI frameworks for a more polished design, or adding interactive elements using game development libraries.  The application's architecture should be designed to facilitate smooth integration with third-party libraries, with well-defined APIs and event handling mechanisms.  Documentation on supported libraries and integration methods is necessary.\n\n### Custom Themes and Styling\n\nTo allow for greater flexibility and customization, Camera Slideshow may offer the ability to apply custom themes or styling. This involves creating and applying custom CSS stylesheets to modify the application's visual appearance.  Users can change colors, fonts, button styles, and other visual elements to match their preferences or branding guidelines.  A theme management system within the application allows for easy switching between pre-defined themes or loading user-created themes.  The application must provide clear guidelines on how to create and use custom themes, including the file structure, naming conventions, and supported CSS properties.\n\n### Event Handling and Callbacks\n\nFor developers to extend the application's functionality, Camera Slideshow should provide a robust event handling system with callbacks.  These callbacks can be triggered at various points during the slideshow's lifecycle, such as when an image is loaded, a transition starts or ends, a user interacts with the controls, or an error occurs.  The application should provide documentation detailing the available events and how to register callbacks to handle them.  This allows developers to perform custom actions in response to specific events, creating more dynamic and interactive slideshows.  Examples of events could include `onImageLoad`, `onTransitionStart`, `onTransitionEnd`, `onPlay`, `onPause`, `onError`.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors\n\nThis section lists common errors encountered when using Camera Slideshow, along with their likely causes and solutions.\n\n* **Error: \"Failed to load image\"**: This error usually indicates that the application cannot access the specified image file or URL.  Check the file path or URL for typos. Ensure the file exists and has the correct permissions.  Verify that the network connection is stable if loading from a URL.\n* **Error: \"Unsupported image format\"**:  Camera Slideshow only supports a specific set of image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP). If an unsupported format is used, this error will appear. Convert the image to a supported format before adding it to the slideshow.\n* **Error: \"Insufficient memory\"**:  This error occurs if the system lacks sufficient RAM to handle the slideshow's demands, especially with high-resolution images or large slideshows. Close unnecessary applications, upgrade RAM, or reduce image resolution.\n* **Error: \"Export failed\"**:  This error might occur due to problems with the output directory, insufficient disk space, or encoding issues.

The application must provide clear guidelines on how to create and use custom themes, including the file structure, naming conventions, and supported CSS properties.\n\n### Event Handling and Callbacks\n\nFor developers to extend the application's functionality, Camera Slideshow should provide a robust event handling system with callbacks.  These callbacks can be triggered at various points during the slideshow's lifecycle, such as when an image is loaded, a transition starts or ends, a user interacts with the controls, or an error occurs.  The application should provide documentation detailing the available events and how to register callbacks to handle them.  This allows developers to perform custom actions in response to specific events, creating more dynamic and interactive slideshows.  Examples of events could include `onImageLoad`, `onTransitionStart`, `onTransitionEnd`, `onPlay`, `onPause`, `onError`.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Errors\n\nThis section lists common errors encountered when using Camera Slideshow, along with their likely causes and solutions.\n\n* **Error: \"Failed to load image\"**: This error usually indicates that the application cannot access the specified image file or URL.  Check the file path or URL for typos. Ensure the file exists and has the correct permissions.  Verify that the network connection is stable if loading from a URL.\n* **Error: \"Unsupported image format\"**:  Camera Slideshow only supports a specific set of image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP). If an unsupported format is used, this error will appear. Convert the image to a supported format before adding it to the slideshow.\n* **Error: \"Insufficient memory\"**:  This error occurs if the system lacks sufficient RAM to handle the slideshow's demands, especially with high-resolution images or large slideshows. Close unnecessary applications, upgrade RAM, or reduce image resolution.\n* **Error: \"Export failed\"**:  This error might occur due to problems with the output directory, insufficient disk space, or encoding issues. Check that you have enough free disk space, the export directory is accessible, and the selected output format is supported.\n* **Error: \"API request failed\"**: If using external APIs, ensure that the API key is valid, the API endpoint is correct, and the network connection is stable. Check the API documentation for error codes.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Check Console Logs:**  Use your browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12) to examine error messages and warnings.  These logs often provide valuable clues about the cause of problems.\n* **Simplify the Slideshow:**  If you encounter unexpected behavior, try creating a minimal slideshow with only a few images and basic settings. This helps isolate the problem.\n* **Test Individually:** If using external APIs or libraries, test each component individually to identify which part is causing the issue.\n* **Use a Debugger:**  Utilize a JavaScript debugger (like the one built into your browser's developer tools) to step through the code and identify the source of errors.\n\n\n### Performance Issues\n\n* **Large Images:** High-resolution images can significantly impact performance. Consider using lower-resolution images or optimizing image sizes to improve loading times and playback smoothness.\n* **Complex Transitions:**  Intricate or resource-intensive transitions can also reduce performance. Opt for simpler transitions if necessary.\n* **Background Processes:**  Other applications running concurrently might consume system resources, affecting Camera Slideshow's performance. Close unnecessary applications before using Camera Slideshow.\n* **Hardware Limitations:** Insufficient RAM or a slow processor can lead to performance issues. Upgrading hardware might be necessary.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nCamera Slideshow should be tested across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent functionality and performance.  Known compatibility issues, if any, should be documented here.   Testing on different browser versions is also crucial to identify and address compatibility problems.\n\n\n### Seeking Help and Support\n\nIf you encounter issues not covered in this manual, please refer to our online support resources:\n\n* **Online Documentation:** [Link to Online Documentation]\n* **Community Forum:** [Link to Community Forum]\n* **Contact Support:** [Link to Contact Support]\n\n\nWe encourage you to provide detailed information about the problem you encountered, including error messages, screenshots, and the steps to reproduce the issue.

This API assumes a JavaScript-based integration.  Adapt as needed for other programming languages.\n\n### Constructor Options\n\nThe Camera Slideshow constructor accepts an options object to configure the slideshow's initial state.  The following options are supported:\n\n* `images`: (Array) An array of image URLs or paths to be included in the slideshow.  Required.\n* `transition`: (String) The default transition effect to use between images (e.g., 'fade', 'slide'). Defaults to 'fade'.\n* `transitionSpeed`: (Number) The default transition speed in milliseconds. Defaults to 500ms.\n* `autoplay`: (Boolean) Whether the slideshow should start playing automatically. Defaults to `false`.\n* `loop`: (Boolean) Whether the slideshow should loop continuously. Defaults to `false`.\n* `container`: (String or HTMLElement)  The ID of the HTML element or the HTMLElement itself where the slideshow will be rendered.  Required.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst slideshow = new CameraSlideshow({\n  images: ['image1.jpg', 'image2.png', 'image3.gif'],\n  transition: 'slide',\n  transitionSpeed: 1000,\n  autoplay: true,\n  loop: true,\n  container: '#slideshow-container' // or document.getElementById('slideshow-container')\n});\n```\n\n### Methods\n\nThe Camera Slideshow object exposes the following methods:\n\n* `play()`: Starts the slideshow playback.\n* `pause()`: Pauses the slideshow playback.\n* `stop()`: Stops the slideshow playback and resets to the first image.\n* `next()`: Advances the slideshow to the next image.\n* `previous()`: Goes back to the previous image.\n* `goTo(index)`: Jumps to the specified image index (0-based).\n* `addImage(imageUrl)`: Adds a new image to the end of the slideshow.\n* `removeImage(index)`: Removes the image at the specified index.\n* `setTransition(transitionType, speed)`: Sets the transition type and speed for all subsequent transitions.\n* `getImages()`: Returns an array of the current images in the slideshow.\n* `destroy()`: Removes the slideshow from the DOM and releases resources.\n\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nslideshow.play();\nslideshow.goTo(2);\nslideshow.addImage('newImage.jpg');\nslideshow.setTransition('fade', 750);\n```\n\n\n### Events\n\nCamera Slideshow triggers the following custom events:\n\n* `slideshowStart`: Fired when the slideshow begins playing.\n* `slideshowPause`: Fired when the slideshow is paused.\n* `slideshowStop`: Fired when the slideshow is stopped.\n* `imageChange`: Fired when the currently displayed image changes.  Provides the index of the new image.\n* `transitionStart`: Fired when a transition between images begins.\n* `transitionEnd`: Fired when a transition between images ends.\n* `error`: Fired when an error occurs (e.g., failed image load).  Provides details about the error.\n\n\n**Example (using `addEventListener`):**\n\n```javascript\nslideshow.addEventListener('imageChange', (event) => {\n  console.log('Image changed to index:', event.detail.index);\n});\n\nslideshow.addEventListener('error', (event) => {\n  console.error('Slideshow error:', event.detail.message);\n});\n```\n\nRemember to consult the full API documentation for detailed descriptions of each method and event parameter.
