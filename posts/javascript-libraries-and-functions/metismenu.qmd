## Introduction

### What is metisMenu?

MetisMenu is a jQuery plugin that provides a flexible and responsive multi-level menu component.  It's designed to create elegant and easily navigable menus for websites and applications, particularly useful in sidebars or navigation areas. MetisMenu offers features like collapsible submenus,  smooth animations, and support for various customization options, making it a versatile choice for enhancing user interface design.


### Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
* **Multi-Level Support:**  Handles nested menus with multiple levels of sub-items.
* **Collapsible Submenus:**  Allows submenus to collapse and expand on click or hover.
* **Customizable Styling:** Easily customizable through CSS to match your project's theme.
* **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring smooth navigation for users with assistive technologies.
* **Simple API:**  Provides a straightforward API for easy integration and configuration.
* **Lightweight:**  Minimal impact on page load times.


### Getting Started

MetisMenu is designed to be easily integrated into your project.  Before you begin, ensure you have included the necessary jQuery library in your HTML file. MetisMenu relies on jQuery for its functionality.  After including jQuery and the MetisMenu JavaScript file (and optionally the CSS file for styling),  you'll initialize the menu by calling the `metisMenu` function on the element containing your menu structure.


### Installation

MetisMenu can be installed using several methods:

* **Download:** Download the latest release from [https://github.com/onokumus/metismenu](https://github.com/onokumus/metismenu). Extract the contents and include the `metisMenu.js` and `metisMenu.css` files in your project.

* **CDN:** Include the MetisMenu files directly from a CDN.  Several CDNs may host MetisMenu; refer to the project's website for the most up-to-date links.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/metisMenu.css">
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/jquery.min.js"></script>  <!--Ensure jQuery is included first-->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/metisMenu.js"></script>
```

* **npm:** If you're using npm, install MetisMenu via the command line:

```bash
npm install metismenu
```

Then, include it in your project using a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel.  Refer to your bundler's documentation for specific instructions on including npm packages.


## Basic Usage

### Initialization

After including the necessary jQuery and MetisMenu files (as described in the Installation section), initializing the menu is straightforward.  You simply call the `metisMenu()` function on the root element of your menu structure.  This element should typically be an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing list items (`<li>`) that represent the menu items.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#myMenu').metisMenu();
});
```

Replace `#myMenu` with the CSS selector for your menu's container element.  This code snippet ensures the menu is initialized after the DOM is fully loaded.


### Markup Structure

Your HTML markup should follow a nested list structure.  Each `<li>` element represents a menu item, and nested `<ul>` elements create submenus.  You can use any HTML elements within your `<li>` elements to create your menu items (e.g., links, icons, text).

```html
<ul id="myMenu">
  <li>
    <a href="#">Item 1</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Item 2</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Subitem 2.1</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Subitem 2.2</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Item 3</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

This structure is crucial for MetisMenu to correctly identify and handle the menu hierarchy.


### Configuration Options

MetisMenu offers several configuration options to customize its behavior.  These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `metisMenu()` function.

* **`toggle`:** (Boolean)  If `true`, submenus will toggle open and closed on click. If `false`, submenus will only expand on click. Defaults to `true`.
* **`preventDefault`:** (Boolean) If `true`, prevents default link behavior (navigation) when clicking on a menu item with a submenu. Defaults to `true`.
* **`doubleTapToGo`:** (Boolean) If `true`, requires a double tap on a menu item to trigger navigation if it has a submenu. Useful to avoid accidental submenu toggling on touch devices. Defaults to `false`.


Example usage:

```javascript
$('#myMenu').metisMenu({
  toggle: false,
  preventDefault: false
});
```


### Default Styles

MetisMenu includes default CSS styles to provide a basic visual appearance.  These styles are included in the `metisMenu.css` file.  You can override these styles or create entirely custom styles using your own CSS to match your project's design. The default styles provide a clean, functional appearance, but you'll likely want to customize them to integrate seamlessly with your application's overall look and feel.  Inspect the provided CSS file to understand the default styling.


## Configuration Options

### `toggle` Option

This boolean option controls how submenus behave when a parent menu item is clicked.

*   **`true` (default):** Submenus will toggle – opening if closed and closing if open.
*   **`false`:** Submenus will only open when clicked; clicking a already-open submenu will not close it.


### `preventDefault` Option

This boolean option determines whether the default link behavior (navigation to the `href` URL) is prevented when clicking a menu item with a submenu.

*   **`true` (default):** Prevents the default link behavior.  Useful to avoid accidental navigation when intending to open a submenu.
*   **`false`:** Allows the default link behavior, even if the item has a submenu.  The submenu will still open/close as configured.


### `slideUpSpeed` Option

This option controls the animation speed (in milliseconds) when a submenu collapses.  Use a numeric value representing milliseconds.  Default is `200`.  For no animation, set it to `0`.


### `slideDownSpeed` Option

This option controls the animation speed (in milliseconds) when a submenu expands. Use a numeric value representing milliseconds. Default is `200`. For no animation, set it to `0`.


### `triggerElement` Option

This option specifies the element within the `<li>` item that triggers the submenu's expansion/collapse. By default, it targets the `<a>` element.  You can use a CSS selector to target a different element, if needed. For instance, if you want to trigger the menu using a specific class: `triggerElement: '.my-custom-trigger'`

### `expand` Option

This method allows programmatic expansion of a specific menu item. You can call it using the following syntax after initialization:

```javascript
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('expand', '#myMenuItem'); //Replace with your menu item selector.
```

This will expand the menu item with the given selector.


### `collapse` Option

This method allows programmatic collapse of a specific menu item.  Similar to `expand`, call it after initialization:

```javascript
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('collapse', '#myMenuItem'); // Replace with your menu item selector.
```

This will collapse the menu item with the given selector.


### `activeClass` Option

This option allows you to customize the CSS class applied to active menu items. By default it uses 'active'.  Change this to a different string value if needed, for example: `activeClass: 'is-active'`

### `onTransitionEnd` Option

This option allows you to specify a callback function that will be executed when a submenu's transition (slide up or down) completes.  The callback function receives the target element as an argument.  Useful for additional actions after the animation is finished.

```javascript
$('#myMenu').metisMenu({
  onTransitionEnd: function(element) {
    console.log('Transition ended on:', element);
  }
});
```


### Customizing the Menu

While MetisMenu provides default styles, significant customization is achieved through CSS.  Inspect the default CSS to understand its structure and modify styles as needed.  You can target specific classes applied by MetisMenu to customize appearances and behaviors without modifying the plugin's core functionality.


### Using Data Attributes

MetisMenu supports using data attributes on list items for finer control.  While not exhaustive, here are some examples:

*   **`data-toggle="collapse"`:** This can be used to override the default behavior of `toggle` option for individual items.  Setting this to `collapse` will prevent a menu item from collapsing even if `toggle` is `true`.


Example:

```html
<li data-toggle="collapse">
  <a href="#">Item that won't collapse</a>
  <ul>...</ul>
</li>
```

Remember to consult the latest MetisMenu documentation for the most up-to-date information on available data attributes and configuration options.


## Advanced Usage

### Nested Menus

MetisMenu inherently supports nested menus of arbitrary depth.  Simply nest `<ul>` elements within your `<li>` elements to create hierarchical menus.  The plugin automatically handles the collapsing and expanding of nested submenus.  Ensure your HTML structure is well-formed and correctly nested to achieve the desired hierarchy.


### Accordion Menus

To create an accordion-style menu (where only one submenu is open at a time), you'll need to manage this behavior yourself using JavaScript.  You can listen for the `shown.metisMenu` and `hidden.metisMenu` events (see Event Handling below) to detect when submenus are opened and closed and then programmatically close other open submenus. This would typically involve traversing the DOM to find other open submenus and closing them using the `collapse` method.


### Programmatic Control

MetisMenu provides methods for programmatic control over the menu's state:

*   **`expand(selector)`:** Expands the menu item matching the given selector.
*   **`collapse(selector)`:** Collapses the menu item matching the given selector.
*   **`destroy()`:** Removes MetisMenu functionality from the element.


These methods are called on the jQuery object representing your menu after initialization:

```javascript
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('expand', '#menuItemToExpand');
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('collapse', '.submenu');
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('destroy');
```


### Event Handling

MetisMenu triggers several events that you can listen for using jQuery's `on()` method:

*   **`shown.metisMenu`:** Triggered when a submenu is shown (expanded).
*   **`hidden.metisMenu`:** Triggered when a submenu is hidden (collapsed).


You can use these events to implement custom actions, such as updating the UI or performing other tasks in response to menu state changes:

```javascript
$('#myMenu').on('shown.metisMenu', function(event, data) {
  console.log('Submenu shown:', data.target);
});

$('#myMenu').on('hidden.metisMenu', function(event, data) {
  console.log('Submenu hidden:', data.target);
});
```
The `data` object in event handlers contains a `target` property referring to the element affected by the event.


### Customizing Styles

MetisMenu's visual appearance is highly customizable through CSS.  You can override the default styles or create your own entirely.  Inspect the provided CSS to identify the classes applied to different elements of the menu, and then target those classes in your custom CSS to create the desired look and feel. Consider using a CSS preprocessor (like Sass or Less) for more organized and maintainable styles.


### Integration with Other Libraries

MetisMenu is designed to be compatible with other JavaScript libraries.  Ensure that any conflicts are properly resolved,  potentially adjusting initialization order or using techniques like namespaces to avoid naming collisions.  Testing is crucial to ensure smooth integration.


### Accessibility

MetisMenu is designed with accessibility in mind, but proper implementation depends on how you integrate it into your application.  Ensure that you use appropriate ARIA attributes (like `aria-expanded` on menu items) to provide semantic information for assistive technologies.  Proper keyboard navigation should also be implemented, considering how users would navigate the menu using only the keyboard.  Thorough testing with assistive technologies is essential to confirm accessibility compliance.


## API Reference

### Methods

MetisMenu provides several methods to control its behavior programmatically.  These methods are called on the jQuery object representing the initialized menu element.

*   **`metisMenu(options)`:** Initializes the plugin.  `options` is an object containing configuration options (see Configuration Options section).  This is the method used for initial setup.

*   **`metisMenu('expand', selector)`:** Expands the submenu matching the given `selector`.  The `selector` should be a valid CSS selector targeting the `<li>` element containing the submenu.

*   **`metisMenu('collapse', selector)`:** Collapses the submenu matching the given `selector`.  Similar to `expand`, the `selector` targets the relevant `<li>`.

*   **`metisMenu('destroy')`:** Removes MetisMenu functionality from the element, reverting it to its original state before initialization.  This removes any added classes and event handlers.


**Example Usage:**

```javascript
// Initialize the menu
$('#myMenu').metisMenu();

// Expand a submenu after initialization
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('expand', '#submenu1');

// Collapse a submenu
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('collapse', '.my-submenu-class');

// Remove MetisMenu functionality
$('#myMenu').metisMenu('destroy');
```


### Events

MetisMenu triggers custom events that can be used to respond to changes in the menu's state.  These events are triggered on the menu element itself.  Use jQuery's `.on()` method to attach event handlers.

*   **`shown.metisMenu`:** This event is fired after a submenu has been expanded (shown).  The event object contains a `target` property that references the expanded submenu element.

*   **`hidden.metisMenu`:** This event is fired after a submenu has been collapsed (hidden). The event object also contains a `target` property referencing the collapsed submenu element.


**Example Usage:**

```javascript
$('#myMenu').on('shown.metisMenu', function(event, data) {
  console.log('Submenu shown:', data.target);
  // Add custom logic here, e.g., update UI elements
});

$('#myMenu').on('hidden.metisMenu', function(event, data) {
  console.log('Submenu hidden:', data.target);
  // Add custom logic here
});

```

These events provide a mechanism to integrate MetisMenu with other parts of your application, allowing for dynamic updates and custom interactions based on menu state changes.  Remember that the `data` object passed to the event handler provides context about the specific menu item involved in the event.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Menu not initializing:**  Double-check that you've included jQuery and the MetisMenu JavaScript and CSS files correctly. Ensure the script including MetisMenu is placed *after* the jQuery inclusion and that the script is executed after the DOM is fully loaded (e.g., within a `$(document).ready()` function). Verify that there are no JavaScript errors in your browser's console.  Incorrect selectors for the menu element in your initialization call (`$('#myMenu')` in the examples) are a frequent cause.

* **Submenus not expanding/collapsing:** Make sure your HTML structure is valid, with properly nested `<ul>` and `<li>` elements. Inspect your menu's HTML in the browser's developer tools to ensure the structure is as expected. Check for any CSS conflicts that might be overriding MetisMenu's styles.  Inspect the browser's developer console for JavaScript errors related to MetisMenu.

* **Incorrect animation:** If submenus are not animating smoothly or at all, check the `slideUpSpeed` and `slideDownSpeed` configuration options. A value of `0` disables animation. Ensure that there are no CSS rules conflicting with the animation.

* **Conflicts with other libraries:** If you're using other JavaScript libraries that manipulate the DOM, conflicts might occur. Try adjusting the order of script inclusions or using techniques like namespaces to avoid naming clashes.  Check your browser's developer console for any errors related to JavaScript conflicts.

* **Accessibility issues:**  Ensure you've included appropriate ARIA attributes (like `aria-expanded`) and that keyboard navigation works as expected.  Test your menu thoroughly with assistive technologies like screen readers.



### Debugging Tips

* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allows you to check for errors in your code, inspect the DOM structure, and see if CSS styles are applied correctly. The console will display any JavaScript errors, which are crucial for identifying problems.

* **Simplify Your Markup:** Create a minimal, isolated example of your menu structure to rule out conflicts with other parts of your code. This allows you to focus on the core MetisMenu functionality.

* **Check the Console:** The browser's JavaScript console will often show errors that can help pinpoint the source of issues.  Pay close attention to any errors or warnings related to MetisMenu.

* **Inspect Network Requests:** Ensure that the MetisMenu files are correctly loaded. Use your browser's developer tools to check the network tab, verifying that the `.js` and `.css` files are being downloaded and have the correct content-type.

* **Step-Through with a Debugger:** If the problem is difficult to isolate, use your browser's debugger to step through the MetisMenu JavaScript code line by line. This allows you to examine variables and see exactly what is happening at each stage.


By systematically checking these points and using the debugging tools provided by your browser, you can effectively identify and resolve most issues you encounter when using MetisMenu.  If a problem persists, providing a minimal, reproducible example of your code (including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) will greatly assist in getting help from the community or the MetisMenu maintainers.


## Examples

These examples demonstrate different usage scenarios of MetisMenu. Remember to include the necessary jQuery and MetisMenu files (JavaScript and CSS) in your HTML before implementing these examples.

### Simple Menu

This example shows a basic, single-level menu.

```html
<ul id="simpleMenu">
  <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
</ul>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#simpleMenu').metisMenu();
  });
</script>
```

This will create a simple, unordered list that is styled by MetisMenu's default CSS.


### Nested Menu

This example demonstrates a multi-level, nested menu.

```html
<ul id="nestedMenu">
  <li>
    <a href="#">Item 1</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Item 2</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Subitem 2.1</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Subitem 2.2</a></li>
      <li>
        <a href="#">Subitem 2.3</a>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Sub-subitem 2.3.1</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
</ul>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#nestedMenu').metisMenu();
  });
</script>
```

This creates a menu with nested submenus.  MetisMenu handles the collapsing and expanding behavior automatically.


### Accordion Menu

Creating an accordion menu (only one submenu open at a time) requires custom JavaScript to manage the state.  This example provides a basic implementation.  More sophisticated approaches may be needed depending on complexity.

```html
<ul id="accordionMenu">
  <li>
    <a href="#">Item 1</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Subitem 1.1</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Item 2</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Subitem 2.1</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#accordionMenu').metisMenu();
    let isOpen = false;
    $('#accordionMenu').on('shown.metisMenu', function(event, data){
        if(isOpen){
            $('#accordionMenu li ul').not(data.target).slideUp();
        }
        isOpen = true;
    });
  });
</script>
```

This example uses the `shown.metisMenu` event to close other open submenus when a new one is opened.


### Custom Styling

Customizing the appearance involves creating your own CSS rules to override or extend MetisMenu's default styles.  This example demonstrates modifying the background color of menu items:


```css
/* Your custom CSS */
#myCustomMenu li a {
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Example: Light gray background */
}

#myCustomMenu li ul {
  background-color: #e0e0e0; /* Example: Slightly darker gray for submenus */
}

```

```html
<ul id="myCustomMenu">
  <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Item 2</a>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Subitem</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('#myCustomMenu').metisMenu();
  });
</script>
```

Remember to include your custom CSS file in your HTML.  This demonstrates a basic style change; you can customize any aspect of the menu's visual presentation using CSS.  Inspect the default MetisMenu CSS to see the classes you can target.
