<h2 id="introduction-to-uniform.js">Introduction to Uniform.js</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-uniform.js">What is Uniform.js?</h3>
<p>Uniform.js is a lightweight and versatile JavaScript library designed to streamline and enhance the development of consistent and visually appealing user interfaces. It provides a simple, yet powerful, API for applying standardized styling and behavior to various HTML form elements, making it easy to create beautiful and user-friendly forms without extensive custom CSS and JavaScript. Uniform.js focuses on improving the default appearance and usability of standard HTML form elements across different browsers, ensuring a consistent experience for all users. It avoids heavy dependencies and strives for minimal performance overhead.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-and-benefits">Key Features and Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-browser Compatibility:</strong> Uniform.js ensures a consistent look and feel across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.), eliminating the need for browser-specific styling adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Styling:</strong> Easily apply custom styling to form elements with minimal code. The library provides a clean and intuitive API for customizing appearances.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Usability:</strong> Improve the user experience with subtle but effective enhancements to default form element behavior, such as improved accessibility and visual feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight and Fast:</strong> Uniform.js is designed to be lightweight, minimizing its impact on page load times and overall performance.</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Easily extend Uniform.js’s functionality through plugins and custom themes.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Dependencies:</strong> The library has minimal external dependencies, simplifying integration and reducing the risk of conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>
<p>Uniform.js is ideal for front-end developers, designers, and anyone involved in building web applications or websites that require visually appealing and consistent forms. Its ease of use makes it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers looking to improve their form styling and handling with minimal effort. It’s particularly useful for projects where maintaining a consistent brand aesthetic across forms is paramount.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-development-environment">Setting up the Development Environment</h3>
<p>To develop with Uniform.js, you’ll need a standard web development environment. This typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A text editor or IDE:</strong> VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or similar.</li>
<li><strong>A web browser:</strong> Chrome, Firefox, or similar for testing.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js and npm (or yarn):</strong> Necessary for running build tasks if you plan on extending or modifying the library itself. For simply using Uniform.js in a project, these are not required.</li>
<li><strong>A local web server (optional but recommended):</strong> For testing purposes, a local server (like Python’s <code>http.server</code> or similar) will provide a more realistic environment compared to directly opening files in the browser.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation-and-setup">Installation and Setup</h3>
<p>Uniform.js can be easily integrated into your project using a CDN or by downloading the library directly.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Using a CDN (simplest method):</strong></p>
<p>Include the following <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in your HTML file’s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">script</span><span class="ot"> src</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"https://cdn.example.com/uniform.min.js"</span><span class="dt">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="kw">script</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span> <span class="co">&lt;!-- Replace with actual CDN link --&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, apply Uniform.js to your form elements using JavaScript (see documentation for specific usage).</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Downloading and Including:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download the Uniform.js library from [link to download].</li>
<li>Place the <code>uniform.js</code> (or <code>uniform.min.js</code> for the minimized version) file in your project’s <code>js</code> directory (or similar).</li>
<li>Include the script in your HTML file using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, referencing the local path to the file:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">script</span><span class="ot"> src</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"js/uniform.js"</span><span class="dt">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="kw">script</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>After including the script, you can apply Uniform.js to your forms using the API described in the library’s documentation. Remember to consult the documentation for detailed instructions and examples.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h3>
<p>Uniform.js utilizes a straightforward data structure based on JavaScript objects and arrays. The core data structure used to represent the form’s data is a plain JavaScript object where keys correspond to form field names (typically the <code>name</code> attribute) and values represent the corresponding field values. Nested objects are used to represent complex forms or forms with nested structures. For example, a form with fields “firstName”, “lastName”, and an address object (“address” containing “street”, “city”, “zip”) would have the following structure:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>{</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">firstName</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">"John"</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">lastName</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">"Doe"</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">address</span><span class="op">:</span> {</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">street</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">"123 Main St"</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">city</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">"Anytown"</span><span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="dt">zip</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="st">"12345"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Arrays are used when a form contains multiple instances of the same field type (e.g., multiple checkboxes with the same name).</p>
<h3 id="uniform-components">Uniform Components</h3>
<p>Uniform.js doesn’t employ a strict component model in the traditional sense of reusable UI components with their own internal state and lifecycle. Instead, it focuses on enhancing existing HTML form elements. The “components” are essentially the standard HTML form elements (input fields, select elements, textareas, etc.) which are styled and enhanced by Uniform.js. The library applies its styling and behavior to these existing elements, rather than creating entirely new UI components. This keeps the library lightweight and avoids unnecessary complexity.</p>
<h3 id="data-binding">Data Binding</h3>
<p>Uniform.js provides a simple, unidirectional data binding mechanism. This means that changes to the underlying data structure (the JavaScript object representing the form data) are reflected in the form elements, and changes made in the form elements update the underlying data. However, the library itself doesn’t implement advanced two-way data binding; any updates to the data object need to be explicitly applied to the form. This is often handled by using JavaScript to listen for changes in form element values and update the data object accordingly. This approach gives the developer greater control and flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="state-management">State Management</h3>
<p>Uniform.js doesn’t have an inbuilt state management system; it focuses solely on styling and enhancing form elements. For managing the overall application state, including the form’s data, developers are free to use any state management library they prefer (such as Redux, Vuex, Zustand, or even a simple object in the component’s scope if the application is small enough). The form data itself is managed externally, and Uniform.js simply provides a clean mechanism for rendering and interacting with this data.</p>
<h3 id="event-handling">Event Handling</h3>
<p>Uniform.js doesn’t directly handle form submission or other complex events. It primarily focuses on visual enhancement and consistent behavior across browsers. To handle events like form submission, change events on individual form fields, or other user interactions, you would use standard JavaScript event listeners attached to the form elements or the form itself. Uniform.js does not interfere with or override these event handlers. Standard JavaScript event listeners such as <code>addEventListener</code> should be used to handle events as needed.</p>
<h2 id="component-development">Component Development</h2>
<h3 id="creating-custom-components">Creating Custom Components</h3>
<p>Uniform.js doesn’t support creating custom components in the traditional sense of building reusable UI elements with internal state and lifecycle methods. As mentioned previously, it enhances existing HTML form elements. If you need custom UI elements beyond standard HTML form fields, you should create them separately using a suitable framework or approach and then integrate them into your application alongside Uniform.js for styling form elements within your custom component. Uniform.js itself is not designed for building such components; its role is enhancing existing forms.</p>
<h3 id="component-lifecycle">Component Lifecycle</h3>
<p>Because Uniform.js works directly with standard HTML form elements and not custom components, the concept of a component lifecycle doesn’t apply directly. The lifecycle of the form elements themselves is managed by the browser. Uniform.js’s influence is limited to the initialization and potential updates to styling and behavior when the form or its elements change. There are no lifecycle hooks or methods within Uniform.js.</p>
<h3 id="props-and-attributes">Props and Attributes</h3>
<p>Uniform.js does not utilize props (properties) in the sense of React or Vue components. Styling and configuration are applied primarily through CSS classes and inline styles. Some behavior can be controlled through JavaScript configuration when initializing Uniform.js on a form, but it doesn’t involve a formal “props” mechanism. The standard HTML attributes of form elements are used to define their behavior and functionality. Uniform.js might enhance these, but it doesn’t introduce a new attribute system.</p>
<h3 id="component-composition">Component Composition</h3>
<p>Since there’s no component system within Uniform.js, the concept of component composition doesn’t directly apply. If you need to compose different form elements or custom UI elements, you would handle this using standard HTML and JavaScript techniques. You would arrange your HTML elements as needed, and use JavaScript to manage their interaction and data flow.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-events">Working with Events</h3>
<p>Event handling in applications using Uniform.js relies on standard JavaScript event listeners. To handle events on form elements, you would attach event listeners directly to the elements using <code>addEventListener()</code>. Uniform.js does not provide any custom event system or event handling mechanisms. Events such as <code>change</code>, <code>submit</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code>, etc., can be handled using standard techniques.</p>
<h3 id="styling-components">Styling Components</h3>
<p>Styling form elements enhanced by Uniform.js is primarily done using CSS. Uniform.js itself provides default styling that can be customized by overriding its stylesheets or adding custom CSS rules. You can use any standard CSS approach (e.g., class selectors, ID selectors, inline styles) to customize the appearance of your forms. The use of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS alongside Uniform.js is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="testing-components">Testing Components</h3>
<p>Testing applications that use Uniform.js relies on standard testing approaches for JavaScript and HTML. Unit tests can be used to verify the behavior of your application logic, independent of Uniform.js. Integration tests can be used to test the interaction between your application code and Uniform.js. You’d use frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Cypress, along with appropriate testing patterns for DOM manipulation and event handling, to ensure that the enhanced form elements behave as expected in your application.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-techniques">Advanced Techniques</h2>
<h3 id="asynchronous-operations">Asynchronous Operations</h3>
<p>Uniform.js itself doesn’t directly handle asynchronous operations. However, when building applications that use Uniform.js, you’ll likely need to incorporate asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from an API or performing other time-consuming operations. Standard JavaScript techniques like promises, async/await, and callbacks should be employed for handling these. Uniform.js will simply render the form elements, reflecting the data once the asynchronous operation has completed and the data has been updated in your application’s state.</p>
<h3 id="data-fetching-and-apis">Data Fetching and APIs</h3>
<p>Data fetching and interaction with APIs are handled separately from Uniform.js. You would use <code>fetch</code>, Axios, or similar libraries to retrieve data from APIs. Once the data is received, you’ll update your application’s data model (which may be managed by a state management library), and Uniform.js will automatically reflect these updates in the form if the data binding mechanism is correctly implemented.</p>
<h3 id="form-handling-and-validation">Form Handling and Validation</h3>
<p>Uniform.js does not provide built-in form validation. You will need to implement form validation separately, using client-side JavaScript validation (e.g., using regular expressions, custom validation functions) or server-side validation (after submitting the form). Client-side validation provides immediate feedback to the user, improving usability. Server-side validation is crucial for security and data integrity. You can integrate any validation library or framework with Uniform.js.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-external-libraries">Working with External Libraries</h3>
<p>Uniform.js is designed to work well with other JavaScript libraries. You can integrate it with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte, as well as state management libraries (Redux, Vuex, etc.) and UI component libraries (Bootstrap, Material UI, etc.). Ensure compatibility by checking for potential conflicts and following the usage instructions for each library. The modular nature of Uniform.js generally makes integration straightforward.</p>
<h3 id="performance-optimization">Performance Optimization</h3>
<p>For optimal performance with Uniform.js:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimize JavaScript:</strong> Use the minified version (<code>uniform.min.js</code>) for production.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient CSS:</strong> Write efficient CSS selectors and minimize the number of styles applied. Use CSS preprocessors (like Sass or Less) for organization and maintainability.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> If possible, load Uniform.js only when it’s needed, instead of loading it on every page.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Over-styling:</strong> Don’t apply excessive styling that may impact rendering speed. Stick to essential visual improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sanitize User Input:</strong> Always sanitize any data received from the user before using it in your application to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities. Use appropriate sanitization functions provided by your framework or library.</li>
<li><strong>Server-Side Validation:</strong> Never rely solely on client-side validation. Always validate data on the server before storing or processing it.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS:</strong> Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server, protecting sensitive data during transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Implement robust input validation to prevent malicious inputs and ensure data integrity. This is independent of Uniform.js; you must implement it separately.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Keep Uniform.js and any other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deployment-and-integration">Deployment and Integration</h2>
<h3 id="deployment-strategies">Deployment Strategies</h3>
<p>Deploying applications that use Uniform.js is similar to deploying any other JavaScript application. The primary considerations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>CDN Hosting:</strong> Using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for hosting Uniform.js can improve performance by serving the library from a server geographically closer to the user. This is especially beneficial when using the CDN method for including Uniform.js in your project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bundling:</strong> If you’re using a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel, include Uniform.js as a dependency in your project. The bundler will handle combining Uniform.js with your other application code and optimizing it for production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Static Site Generation:</strong> If you are building a static site (e.g., using tools like Gatsby, Next.js (static mode), etc.), you can include Uniform.js directly in your HTML files generated during the build process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Server-Side Deployment:</strong> For server-side deployments, the typical process for deploying a JavaScript application applies. Make sure your web server can correctly serve the required static files (Uniform.js, CSS, and other assets).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="integration-with-other-frameworks">Integration with Other Frameworks</h3>
<p>Uniform.js is designed to be framework-agnostic. It can be integrated with various JavaScript frameworks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>React:</strong> You can include Uniform.js in your React project and use it to style form elements within your React components. The integration is straightforward; simply include Uniform.js and apply it to your form elements as needed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Angular:</strong> Similar to React, you can incorporate Uniform.js into your Angular application. You’ll typically apply Uniform.js within your Angular components, after the components have been rendered by Angular.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vue.js:</strong> Uniform.js works seamlessly with Vue.js. You can include Uniform.js and use it within your Vue components to style the forms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vanilla JavaScript:</strong> Uniform.js is designed to be easily integrated into applications using plain JavaScript (without any framework).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the process of integration involves including Uniform.js in your project and then applying its functionality to the relevant form elements within your framework’s component structure.</p>
<h3 id="server-side-rendering-ssr">Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</h3>
<p>Uniform.js is primarily a client-side library, and its direct use within server-side rendering (SSR) might require careful consideration. Since Uniform.js enhances the appearance and behavior of <em>existing</em> DOM elements, it relies on the browser’s rendering capabilities. While you can include the Uniform.js script in your server-rendered HTML, the actual styling and enhancement will only take effect after the page loads in the browser. You should <em>not</em> attempt to execute Uniform.js on the server; its purpose is client-side enhancement. The primary use case for Uniform.js is client-side styling and behavior.</p>
<h3 id="building-for-production">Building for Production</h3>
<p>Building Uniform.js for production involves these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Minification:</strong> Use a minifier to reduce the file size of Uniform.js. This improves loading times. The <code>uniform.min.js</code> file (if available) is already minified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bundling (if applicable):</strong> If your project uses a module bundler (Webpack, Parcel, etc.), the bundler will typically handle minification, code splitting, and other optimizations during the build process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Splitting:</strong> For larger applications, consider code splitting to load only the necessary parts of Uniform.js when needed, improving initial load times.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Caching:</strong> Configure appropriate caching headers on your web server to improve performance by caching static assets like Uniform.js.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing:</strong> Thoroughly test your application after the production build to ensure everything works as expected.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After building for production, deploy the optimized files to your hosting environment. Make sure to include appropriate caching directives to leverage browser caching effectively.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-and-support">Troubleshooting and Support</h2>
<h3 id="common-issues-and-solutions">Common Issues and Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uniform.js not working:</strong> Double-check that you’ve correctly included the Uniform.js script in your HTML file and that the path to the script is accurate. Ensure the script is included <em>after</em> the form elements it’s intended to style. Inspect your browser’s developer console for JavaScript errors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Styling issues:</strong> Check your CSS for conflicts with Uniform.js’s default styles. Ensure your custom styles are properly scoped and have the correct specificity to override Uniform.js’s styles if needed. Inspect the rendered HTML with your browser’s developer tools to see if the CSS classes applied by Uniform.js are present.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaScript errors:</strong> Examine the browser’s developer console for error messages. These often pinpoint the source of the problem. Look for syntax errors in your JavaScript code, typos in variable names, or incorrect usage of Uniform.js’s API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Form submission problems:</strong> If forms aren’t submitting correctly, inspect network requests in your browser’s developer tools to check if the form data is being sent correctly to the server. Make sure your server-side code is correctly handling form submissions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inconsistent styling across browsers:</strong> While Uniform.js aims for cross-browser consistency, minor differences might remain due to variations in browser rendering engines. Thorough testing on different browsers is crucial.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debugging-techniques">Debugging Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Browser Developer Tools:</strong> Use your browser’s developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of your page. This allows you to see if Uniform.js is applied correctly, identify styling conflicts, and debug JavaScript errors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Console Logging:</strong> Use <code>console.log()</code> statements in your JavaScript code to print variables and track the execution flow. This helps to identify errors or unexpected behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaScript Debuggers:</strong> Use a JavaScript debugger (built into browser developer tools or standalone debuggers) to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and set breakpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Tab:</strong> Use the Network tab in your browser’s developer tools to monitor network requests and responses. This is crucial for debugging form submission issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplify your code:</strong> If you’re facing complex issues, try to simplify your code to isolate the problem. Create a minimal reproducible example that demonstrates the issue.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="community-support-and-resources">Community Support and Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Online Forums:</strong> Search for relevant discussions on online forums or communities related to web development and JavaScript. Many developers have encountered similar issues and may have solutions available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Carefully review the official Uniform.js documentation. This often contains solutions for common problems and FAQs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue Tracker:</strong> If you can’t find a solution elsewhere, check the official issue tracker (if one exists) for reported bugs. This might help determine if the problem is a known bug or a configuration issue on your end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stack Overflow:</strong> Stack Overflow is a valuable resource for asking and answering technical questions related to programming. Search for existing answers or ask a new question if your problem is unique.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reporting-bugs-and-issues">Reporting Bugs and Issues</h3>
<p>When reporting bugs or issues, be as descriptive as possible. Provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uniform.js version:</strong> Specify the version of Uniform.js you are using.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Browser and version:</strong> State the browser(s) where the issue occurs and their versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Specify your operating system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong> Detail the exact steps required to reproduce the bug or issue. A minimal, reproducible example is very helpful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected behavior:</strong> Describe what you expected to happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Actual behavior:</strong> Explain what actually happened.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error messages (if any):</strong> Include any error messages you encountered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relevant code snippets:</strong> Provide code snippets that are relevant to the issue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clear and detailed bug reports significantly aid developers in resolving the problem efficiently. This increases the likelihood of your issue being addressed quickly.</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h3 id="glossary-of-terms">Glossary of Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uniform.js:</strong> A lightweight JavaScript library for styling and enhancing HTML form elements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Binding:</strong> The synchronization of data between a model (data structure) and the user interface (form elements). In Uniform.js, this is unidirectional; updates to the model are reflected in the form, but changes in the form require explicit updating of the model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Component (in the context of Uniform.js):</strong> Refers to standard HTML form elements (input fields, select menus, etc.) that are styled and enhanced by Uniform.js. Uniform.js does not have a component model in the traditional sense of reusable UI elements with internal state and lifecycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Styling:</strong> Applying visual appearance to form elements using CSS. Uniform.js provides default styling, but this can be overridden or extended with custom CSS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asynchronous Operation:</strong> A task that runs independently of the main program flow, often involving network requests or time-consuming processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSR (Server-Side Rendering):</strong> A technique for rendering web pages on the server instead of solely in the browser. Uniform.js is mainly for client-side enhancement, so its direct use within SSR is limited.</p></li>
</ul>
