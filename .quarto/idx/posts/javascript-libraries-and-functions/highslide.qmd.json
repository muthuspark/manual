For best results, it's recommended to test thoroughly across your target browsers.\n\n\n### Getting Started: Installation and Setup\n\nHighslide JS is typically installed by including the necessary JavaScript and CSS files in your web page.  The process usually involves these steps:\n\n1. **Download:** Download the Highslide JS package from the official website.\n2. **Include Files:**  Place the downloaded files (typically `highslide.js` and `highslide.css`) in your website's directory.  Then, include them in your HTML file within the `<head>` section using `<link>` for the CSS and `<script>` for the JavaScript, ensuring correct paths:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"path/to/highslide.css\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"path/to/highslide.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    hs.graphicsDir = 'path/to/graphics/'; // Path to graphics directory (if needed)\n    hs.align = 'center'; //Example configuration\n    hs.showCredits = false; // Example configuration.\n</script>\n```\n\n3. **Initialize (optional):**  While not always strictly required, you might need to initialize Highslide JS with specific configurations using JavaScript. The provided example shows basic configuration. Refer to the documentation for advanced configuration options.\n\n4. **Markup Your Images:** Use the provided Highslide JS markup to link your images, indicating which images should be opened in the lightbox.  The specific markup will vary based on how you wish to display your images; the documentation provides clear examples and explanations.\n\nRemember to replace `\"path/to/...\"` with the actual path to your Highslide JS files and graphics directory.  After completing these steps, your images should now open in the Highslide JS lightbox.  Refer to the full documentation for more detailed instructions and advanced configurations.\n\n\n## Basic Usage and Configuration\n\n### Creating a Simple Highslide Gallery\n\nCreating a basic Highslide gallery involves linking your images using specific HTML markup.  Highslide JS uses a simple, intuitive approach.  Each image link needs to be wrapped in a `<a>` tag with specific attributes.  Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"image1.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"thumb1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"image2.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"thumb2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"image3.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"thumb3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\" />\n</a>\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n* `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, `\"image3.jpg\"` are the paths to your full-size images.\n* `\"thumb1.jpg\"`, `\"thumb2.jpg\"`, `\"thumb3.jpg\"` are the paths to your thumbnail images (optional, but recommended for a better user experience).\n* `onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\"` is the crucial part that triggers the Highslide JS lightbox.  The `this` keyword refers to the `<a>` tag itself.\n\nThis basic setup will create a simple gallery.  Clicking on a thumbnail will open the corresponding full-size image in the lightbox.  Remember to replace the placeholder image paths with your actual image paths.\n\n\n### Configuring Highslide Options\n\nHighslide JS offers a wide range of configuration options to customize its appearance and behavior. These options are set using the `hs` object.  For example, to change the transition speed, you would modify the `hs.transitions` property:\n\n```javascript\nhs.transitions = ['expand', 'crossfade']; // Define transition types\nhs.fadeInOut = true; // Enable fade-in/fade-out effects\nhs.dimmingOpacity = 0.75; // Set dimming opacity\nhs.expandDuration = 500;  // Set expansion duration (in milliseconds)\nhs.overlayOpacity = 0.75; // Adjust overlay opacity.\n```\n\nYou can adjust numerous other aspects, such as:\n\n* `hs.align`:  Controls the alignment of the lightbox within the viewport.\n* `hs.width`, `hs.height`:  Set the lightbox dimensions.\n* `hs.wrapperClassName`: Modify the CSS class of the lightbox wrapper.\n* `hs.showCredits`:  Enable or disable the Highslide JS credits.\n\n\nRefer to the complete list of options in the official documentation for a detailed explanation of each setting and its effect.\n\n\n### Using the `hs.htmlExpand` Function\n\nThe `hs.htmlExpand` function allows you to display content other than images in the lightbox. This is particularly useful for showing HTML content, AJAX-loaded content, or the output of other functions:\n\n```javascript\nhs.htmlExpand(element, options);\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `element`:  A DOM element (or a selector string) containing the HTML content to display.  This can be a `<div>`, `<span>`, or any other suitable element.\n* `options`:  An optional object containing Highslide options to further customize the display.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand(document.getElementById('myContent'), { width: 500, height: 300 });\">View Content</a>\n\n<div id=\"myContent\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  This is the content to be displayed in the Highslide lightbox.\n</div>\n```\n\n\n### Working with Images\n\nHighslide JS excels at displaying images.  Besides the basic example shown earlier, you can also use other options for enhanced control:\n\n* **Thumbnails:**  Use thumbnail images linked to larger versions for a more user-friendly experience.\n* **Image Preloading:**  Improve performance by preloading images to reduce loading time when switching between slides.\n* **Caption Support:**  Easily add captions to your images using the appropriate HTML markup.\n* **Multiple Images in a Gallery:**  Highslide automatically handles multiple images linked using the `hs.expand(this)` method within a single page, seamlessly allowing navigation between them.\n\n\n### Working with Flash, Videos, and Other Content\n\nHighslide JS's flexibility extends beyond images.  You can embed Flash objects, videos (via `<iframe>` or `<video>` tags), and other content types using `hs.htmlExpand`.  The key is to correctly structure your HTML and provide the necessary parameters to embed the content properly:\n\n**Example using an iframe for a YouTube video:**\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand({ content: '<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yourVideoID\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', width: 560, height: 340 });\">Watch Video</a>\n```\n\nReplace `\"yourVideoID\"` with your actual YouTube video ID. Similarly, you can adapt this for other video platforms or Flash content. Remember to always consider the dimensions of your embedded content when setting `width` and `height` options for optimal display.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques and Customization\n\n### Customizing the Highslide Interface\n\nHighslide's visual appearance is highly customizable.  You can achieve this primarily through CSS. By inspecting the generated HTML and CSS classes applied by Highslide, you can target specific elements (like the lightbox background, controls, caption area, etc.) and modify their styles to match your website's design.  Create a custom CSS file and link it to your page to override default styles.  This allows you to change colors, fonts, shadows, border styles, and practically any visual aspect of the lightbox.  Remember to be mindful of the class names used by Highslide to ensure your custom CSS targets the correct elements.\n\n\n### Adding JavaScript Event Handlers\n\nHighslide JS provides several events that you can hook into using JavaScript event handlers.  This enables you to execute custom code at specific points during the lightbox's lifecycle (e.g., when it opens, closes, or changes slides).  These events allow for dynamic control and integration with other parts of your website.  Commonly used events include:\n\n* `onOpen`: Triggered when the lightbox opens.\n* `onClose`: Triggered when the lightbox closes.\n* `onBeforeExpand`: Triggered just before the lightbox expands to display content.\n* `onAfterExpand`: Triggered after the lightbox has finished expanding.\n* `onChange`: Triggered when the user navigates to a different slide.\n\nTo add an event handler, you use the `hs.addEvent` function:\n\n```javascript\nhs.addEvent( 'onOpen', function() {\n  // Your custom code here\n  console.log('Highslide opened!');\n});\n```\n\n\n### Using Highslide with AJAX\n\nHighslide's `hs.htmlExpand` function is perfectly suited for integrating with AJAX.  You can use AJAX to dynamically load content into the lightbox instead of relying on pre-loaded HTML.  This allows for creating dynamic galleries with content fetched from a server or a database:\n\n```javascript\n$.ajax({\n  url: 'your-ajax-url.php',\n  success: function(data) {\n    hs.htmlExpand( { content: data, width: 600, height: 400 } );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis code makes an AJAX request and, upon success, uses the retrieved data (`data`) to populate the content of the Highslide lightbox.  Remember to replace `'your-ajax-url.php'` with the actual URL of your AJAX endpoint.\n\n\n### Integrating with Other JavaScript Libraries\n\nHighslide JS generally plays well with other JavaScript libraries.  However, potential conflicts can arise if libraries attempt to modify the DOM in overlapping ways.  Careful consideration of the order in which scripts are included in your HTML file (placing Highslide's script appropriately) can often resolve such issues.  In cases of persistent conflict, you might need to adjust timing (using timeouts or events) to synchronize actions between the libraries.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Highslide Plugins\n\nFor advanced customization, consider creating custom plugins.  A plugin extends Highslide's functionality by adding new features or modifying existing ones.  This allows for highly specialized interactions and integration within your specific website needs.  Creating a plugin typically involves defining a JavaScript object that conforms to Highslide's plugin interface.\n\n\n### Advanced Configuration Options\n\nBeyond the basic options, Highslide offers a range of advanced settings to finely tune its behavior.  These options, often not readily apparent in initial documentation, allow for precise control over aspects such as:\n\n* **Preloading:**  Control how many images are preloaded and the method used for preloading (e.g., sequential vs. parallel loading).\n* **Transition Effects:**  Customize the animation effects when switching between slides.\n* **Gallery Navigation:**  Adjust the placement and appearance of gallery navigation controls.\n* **Accessibility Features:**  Fine-tune keyboard navigation and screen-reader compatibility.\n* **Error Handling:** Implement custom error handling for failed image loads or other errors.\n* **Caching:** Control how Highslide handles caching of images and other content.\n\n\nConsult the full documentation for a comprehensive list of these advanced configuration options and their usage.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nAccessibility is crucial for a good user experience.  When implementing Highslide, consider these aspects:\n\n* **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure users can fully navigate the gallery and its features using the keyboard alone.  Highslide natively supports keyboard navigation but ensure this functionality is functioning properly.\n* **Screen Reader Compatibility:**  Properly label images and other content to ensure screen readers can convey information accurately to visually impaired users.  Provide alternative text (`alt` attributes) for all images.\n* **ARIA Attributes:**  Consider using appropriate ARIA attributes to further enhance screen reader compatibility and semantic meaning.\n* **Focus Management:** Manage keyboard focus carefully to avoid unexpected behavior or trapped focus.\n* **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background elements within the lightbox for readability.\n\n\nBy proactively addressing these points, you can make your Highslide galleries inclusive and accessible to all users.\n\n\n## Working with Galleries\n\n### Creating and Managing Galleries\n\nHighslide doesn't explicitly define a \"gallery\" object. Instead, a gallery is implicitly created by linking multiple images (or other content) using the `hs.expand(this)` method within your HTML.  Each `<a>` tag with this method call contributes to the gallery.  Highslide automatically handles the transitions and navigation between these linked items.  There's no special setup required beyond ensuring that the linked elements are correctly marked up.  Managing the gallery involves managing the HTML elements and their attributes—adding, removing, or reordering links as needed.\n\n\n### Gallery Navigation and Controls\n\nHighslide provides built-in navigation controls for moving between items in your gallery.  By default, these include \"previous\" and \"next\" buttons within the lightbox.  Users can also navigate using keyboard shortcuts (typically left and right arrow keys). You can customize the appearance of these controls through CSS. While Highslide doesn't offer direct programmatic control over the navigation (like disabling buttons), you can achieve similar effects indirectly using JavaScript event handlers. For example, you can disable the \"next\" button by manipulating the visibility or functionality of the respective HTML elements involved, thereby restricting navigation.\n\n\n### Gallery Thumbnails\n\nWhile Highslide doesn't mandate the use of thumbnails, they significantly enhance the user experience.  Thumbnails are simply smaller versions of your images displayed alongside the main links.  The association between thumbnails and their corresponding full-size images is established by the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag pointing to the large image. This is the method Highslide uses to establish the gallery and navigation. The visual presentation (layout, arrangement) of thumbnails is entirely determined by your HTML and CSS. You can arrange them horizontally, vertically, or in any custom layout.\n\n\n### Gallery Ordering and Sorting\n\nThe order in which your images appear in the gallery is dictated by the order of their associated `<a>` tags within your HTML. To change the order of items in your gallery, simply rearrange the `<a>` tags in your HTML source.  Highslide respects the DOM structure, so any changes to the HTML directly affect the gallery's order.  There is no specific sorting mechanism provided by Highslide; sorting must be handled at the HTML level or externally (e.g., using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM before the Highslide script runs).\n\n\n### Auto-Generating Galleries\n\nHighslide doesn't directly support automatic gallery generation from a data source (like a directory of images).  To create automatically populated galleries, you'll need to employ server-side scripting (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) or client-side JavaScript to:\n\n1. **Fetch the image data:** Retrieve a list of images from a database or file system.\n2. **Generate the HTML:** Dynamically construct the necessary `<a>` tags with the correct `href` and `onclick` attributes based on the image data fetched.\n3. **Insert the HTML:**  Inject this dynamically generated HTML into your webpage where the gallery should appear.\n\nThis approach requires programming beyond the scope of the Highslide JS library itself.  You'll be using Highslide only to display the content dynamically created by your server-side or client-side code.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Debugging\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nSeveral common issues arise when working with Highslide JS.  Here are some frequently encountered problems and their solutions:\n\n* **Highslide not displaying:**  Double-check that you've correctly included both the `highslide.js` and `highslide.css` files in your HTML, ensuring the paths are accurate. Verify that there are no JavaScript errors in your browser's console.  Ensure the linked images actually exist at the specified paths.\n* **Images not loading:**  Check for typos in image paths. Ensure that the server is serving the images correctly.  Inspect your browser's network tab to identify any loading errors.  Verify that the necessary image formats are supported.\n* **Incorrect lightbox dimensions:**  Check the `hs.width` and `hs.height` configuration options if the lightbox is not sized appropriately. Ensure that your images have correct dimensions for optimal viewing.\n* **CSS conflicts:**  If the lightbox's styling is unexpected, ensure that your custom CSS isn't overriding Highslide's styles unintentionally. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS applied to the lightbox elements.\n* **JavaScript errors:**  Open your browser's developer console to see any JavaScript errors that may prevent Highslide from functioning correctly. These errors will often provide clues to the problem's source.\n* **Gallery navigation issues:**  Ensure that all links are correctly using `hs.expand(this)` or similar methods. Verify the order of elements in your HTML to match your intended gallery sequence.\n\n\n### Debugging Techniques\n\nEffective debugging involves systematic investigation.  Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Inspect the HTML:**  Carefully check the markup of your links to ensure they are correctly configured for Highslide.\n2. **Check the browser console:**  The browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12) displays JavaScript errors and warnings that can pinpoint problems.\n3. **Simplify your code:**  Temporarily remove custom CSS and JavaScript to see if the problem is caused by conflicting code.  Create a minimal example to isolate the issue.\n4. **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The developer tools allow you to step through the code, inspect the DOM, and view network requests, giving insights into Highslide's behavior.\n5. **Test in different browsers:**  Test your implementation in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to check for cross-browser compatibility issues.\n6. **Consult the Highslide documentation:**  The official Highslide documentation is a valuable resource for troubleshooting and finding answers to common problems.\n7. **Search for similar issues online:** Search online forums and communities (Stack Overflow, etc.) for solutions to problems others have encountered.\n\n\n### Error Messages and Their Meanings\n\nHighslide JS usually doesn't produce extensive error messages. Most problems manifest as the lightbox failing to appear or functioning incorrectly.  JavaScript errors in your browser's console (usually indicating a problem with your custom code or incorrect Highslide configuration) are the most valuable clues. Pay close attention to the line number and error message in your browser's developer tools to quickly locate and fix these errors.  If there are no obvious JavaScript errors, ensure correct paths to images and CSS/JS files are specified.  Common errors involve file paths, incorrect usage of API calls, and CSS conflicts.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance, consider these points:\n\n* **Image Optimization:**  Use appropriately sized images. Optimize images for web use to reduce file sizes without significant quality loss.\n* **Caching:** Configure your web server and browser caching settings effectively to reduce the number of requests made to fetch images.\n* **Preloading:** Utilize Highslide's preloading options to load images before they are needed, improving the perceived speed of the gallery.\n* **Lazy Loading:** If dealing with many images, consider lazy loading techniques (loading images only when they come into the viewport) to avoid unnecessary downloads.\n* **Minimize HTTP Requests:** Reduce the number of HTTP requests by combining CSS and JavaScript files.\n* **Efficient JavaScript:** Write clean, efficient JavaScript code to avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations and calculations that could impact performance.\n* **Minimize DOM Changes:** If using dynamic content, reduce the number of times you're changing the DOM inside `hs.htmlExpand` callbacks.\n\n\nBy following these best practices, you can ensure that your Highslide-powered galleries remain responsive and performant, even with a large number of images.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a reference to the core components of the Highslide JS API.  Note that the exact methods, properties, and events might vary slightly depending on the version of Highslide JS you are using. Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive information.\n\n### Highslide JS Core Objects\n\nHighslide JS primarily revolves around the `hs` object, which holds core functionalities and configuration options.  This object is globally accessible after including the Highslide JS library in your HTML.  The `hs` object serves as the primary interaction point with the library.  Direct manipulation of other internal objects is generally discouraged, as the internal structure of Highslide might change in future versions.  It is best to interact with the library via the documented methods and properties exposed by the `hs` object.\n\n### Highslide JS Methods\n\nHighslide provides several crucial methods for interacting with the lightbox and its content:\n\n* **`hs.expand(element)`:** This is the core function to open the Highslide lightbox.  `element` is typically an `<a>` tag (or a selector string pointing to one), although it can be other suitable DOM elements. This function triggers the display of the content linked to the element.\n\n* **`hs.htmlExpand(element, options)`:**  Displays HTML content or content generated dynamically within the lightbox. `element` can be a DOM element or a configuration object. `options` allows for custom settings for the lightbox display.\n\n* **`hs.close()`:** Closes the currently open Highslide lightbox.\n\n* **`hs.get()`:** Retrieves information about the currently active Highslide instance (e.g., the currently displayed image or the gallery).\n\n* **`hs.addEvent(eventName, eventHandler)`:** Attaches a custom event handler to a Highslide event. (`eventName` is the event name, `eventHandler` is the function to execute).\n\n* **`hs.removeEvent(eventName, eventHandler)`:** Detaches an event handler previously attached with `hs.addEvent`.\n\nThese are essential methods; the complete API reference in the official documentation contains a detailed explanation of each method's parameters and return values.\n\n### Highslide JS Events\n\nHighslide triggers various events during its operation, allowing you to execute custom code at specific points:\n\n* **`onOpen`:** Fired when the lightbox is opened.\n* **`onClose`:** Fired when the lightbox is closed.\n* **`onBeforeExpand`:** Fired just before the lightbox expands to display content.\n* **`onAfterExpand`:** Fired after the lightbox has fully expanded.\n* **`onChange`:** Fired when the user navigates to a different item in the gallery.\n* **`onError`:** Fired when an error occurs (e.g., image loading failure).\n\n\nYou can attach event handlers to these events using `hs.addEvent()` to integrate custom behaviors.  Remember to use descriptive event handler names to improve code readability and maintainability.  The event object passed to the handler typically includes information relevant to the event.\n\n### Highslide JS Options\n\nHighslide's behavior and appearance are heavily customizable through numerous options. These options are set by assigning values to properties of the global `hs` object:\n\n* **`hs.graphicsDir`:** Path to the Highslide graphics directory.\n* **`hs.align`:** Alignment of the lightbox within the viewport (e.g., 'center', 'top left').\n* **`hs.expandDuration`:** Duration of the expand animation.\n* **`hs.fadeInOut`:** Enables fade-in/fade-out effects.\n* **`hs.overlayOpacity`:** Opacity of the dimming overlay.\n* **`hs.dimmingOpacity`:** Opacity of the dimming effect.\n* **`hs.showCredits`:** Whether to display Highslide credits.\n* **`hs.width`, `hs.height`:** Dimensions of the lightbox.\n* **`hs.transitions`:** Array of transition types to use.\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.  Many more options are available for controlling various aspects of Highslide. The official documentation provides a complete list and descriptions of each option.  Careful configuration of these options is key to integrating Highslide smoothly into your web application.  Using the correct option names and data types is crucial.  Incorrect configurations may result in unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section provides practical examples demonstrating various uses of Highslide JS. Remember to replace placeholder file paths and URLs with your actual data.  Also ensure that you've correctly included the Highslide JS library and CSS in your HTML file.\n\n### Image Gallery Example\n\nThis example shows a simple image gallery with thumbnails:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Highslide Image Gallery</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"highslide.css\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"highslide.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nhs.graphicsDir = 'graphics/';\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<a href=\"images/large1.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"images/thumb1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" width=\"100\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"images/large2.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"images/thumb2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"100\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"images/large3.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"images/thumb3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\" width=\"100\" />\n</a>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `\"images/large1.jpg\"`, `\"images/thumb1.jpg\"`, etc. with the actual paths to your large and thumbnail images.  Ensure the `graphics` directory (containing Highslide's graphics) exists in the same directory as your HTML file or adjust `hs.graphicsDir` accordingly.\n\n\n### Image Zoom Example\n\nThis example demonstrates zooming into an image using Highslide:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"images/large_image.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this, {  slideshowGroup: 'group1' });\">\n    <img src=\"images/large_image.jpg\" alt=\"Zoomable Image\" />\n</a>\n```\nThis uses the default zoom functionality of Highslide.  Adjust the image source as needed.  Adding `slideshowGroup` allows for simple slideshow functionality if you have multiple similar images on the page.\n\n\n### Ajax Content Example\n\nThis example fetches content via AJAX and displays it in the lightbox:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return loadAjaxContent();\">Load Content via AJAX</a>\n\n<script>\nfunction loadAjaxContent() {\n  $.ajax({\n    url: 'ajax_content.html',\n    success: function(data) {\n      hs.htmlExpand( { content: data, width: 600, height: 400 } );\n    }\n  });\n  return false;\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nReplace `'ajax_content.html'` with the URL of your AJAX endpoint that returns the HTML content to be displayed.  This assumes you are using jQuery for AJAX; adapt as needed for other AJAX libraries.\n\n\n### Flash Content Example\n\nThis example embeds a Flash object within Highslide (note that Flash is largely deprecated; consider alternatives like HTML5 video):\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand({ content: '<object type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" data=\\\"flash_content.swf\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\"></object>', width: 400, height: 300 });\">View Flash Content</a>\n```\n\nReplace `\"flash_content.swf\"` with the path to your Flash file.  Ensure the necessary Flash plugin is installed in the user's browser (though its usage is now very limited).\n\n\n### Video Content Example\n\nThis example uses an iframe to embed a YouTube video:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand({ content: '<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', width: 560, height: 340 });\">View YouTube Video</a>\n```\n\nReplace `\"VIDEO_ID\"` with the actual YouTube video ID.  You can adapt this example for other video platforms by modifying the iframe source URL.  Always consider appropriate dimensions for the video embed within the lightbox.\n\n\nRemember to adapt these examples to your specific needs and context.  Consult the full documentation for advanced customization and further examples.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n### What is Highslide JS?\n\nHighslide JS is a popular and lightweight JavaScript library designed to create beautiful and user-friendly image galleries and lightbox effects on websites.

Then, include them in your HTML file within the `<head>` section using `<link>` for the CSS and `<script>` for the JavaScript, ensuring correct paths:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"path/to/highslide.css\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"path/to/highslide.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    hs.graphicsDir = 'path/to/graphics/'; // Path to graphics directory (if needed)\n    hs.align = 'center'; //Example configuration\n    hs.showCredits = false; // Example configuration.\n</script>\n```\n\n3. **Initialize (optional):**  While not always strictly required, you might need to initialize Highslide JS with specific configurations using JavaScript. The provided example shows basic configuration. Refer to the documentation for advanced configuration options.\n\n4. **Markup Your Images:** Use the provided Highslide JS markup to link your images, indicating which images should be opened in the lightbox.  The specific markup will vary based on how you wish to display your images; the documentation provides clear examples and explanations.\n\nRemember to replace `\"path/to/...\"` with the actual path to your Highslide JS files and graphics directory.  After completing these steps, your images should now open in the Highslide JS lightbox.  Refer to the full documentation for more detailed instructions and advanced configurations.\n\n\n## Basic Usage and Configuration\n\n### Creating a Simple Highslide Gallery\n\nCreating a basic Highslide gallery involves linking your images using specific HTML markup.  Highslide JS uses a simple, intuitive approach.  Each image link needs to be wrapped in a `<a>` tag with specific attributes.  Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"image1.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"thumb1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"image2.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"thumb2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"image3.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"thumb3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\" />\n</a>\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n* `\"image1.jpg\"`, `\"image2.jpg\"`, `\"image3.jpg\"` are the paths to your full-size images.\n* `\"thumb1.jpg\"`, `\"thumb2.jpg\"`, `\"thumb3.jpg\"` are the paths to your thumbnail images (optional, but recommended for a better user experience).\n* `onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\"` is the crucial part that triggers the Highslide JS lightbox.  The `this` keyword refers to the `<a>` tag itself.\n\nThis basic setup will create a simple gallery.  Clicking on a thumbnail will open the corresponding full-size image in the lightbox.  Remember to replace the placeholder image paths with your actual image paths.\n\n\n### Configuring Highslide Options\n\nHighslide JS offers a wide range of configuration options to customize its appearance and behavior. These options are set using the `hs` object.  For example, to change the transition speed, you would modify the `hs.transitions` property:\n\n```javascript\nhs.transitions = ['expand', 'crossfade']; // Define transition types\nhs.fadeInOut = true; // Enable fade-in/fade-out effects\nhs.dimmingOpacity = 0.75; // Set dimming opacity\nhs.expandDuration = 500;  // Set expansion duration (in milliseconds)\nhs.overlayOpacity = 0.75; // Adjust overlay opacity.\n```\n\nYou can adjust numerous other aspects, such as:\n\n* `hs.align`:  Controls the alignment of the lightbox within the viewport.\n* `hs.width`, `hs.height`:  Set the lightbox dimensions.\n* `hs.wrapperClassName`: Modify the CSS class of the lightbox wrapper.\n* `hs.showCredits`:  Enable or disable the Highslide JS credits.\n\n\nRefer to the complete list of options in the official documentation for a detailed explanation of each setting and its effect.\n\n\n### Using the `hs.htmlExpand` Function\n\nThe `hs.htmlExpand` function allows you to display content other than images in the lightbox. This is particularly useful for showing HTML content, AJAX-loaded content, or the output of other functions:\n\n```javascript\nhs.htmlExpand(element, options);\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `element`:  A DOM element (or a selector string) containing the HTML content to display.  This can be a `<div>`, `<span>`, or any other suitable element.\n* `options`:  An optional object containing Highslide options to further customize the display.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand(document.getElementById('myContent'), { width: 500, height: 300 });\">View Content</a>\n\n<div id=\"myContent\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  This is the content to be displayed in the Highslide lightbox.\n</div>\n```\n\n\n### Working with Images\n\nHighslide JS excels at displaying images.  Besides the basic example shown earlier, you can also use other options for enhanced control:\n\n* **Thumbnails:**  Use thumbnail images linked to larger versions for a more user-friendly experience.\n* **Image Preloading:**  Improve performance by preloading images to reduce loading time when switching between slides.\n* **Caption Support:**  Easily add captions to your images using the appropriate HTML markup.\n* **Multiple Images in a Gallery:**  Highslide automatically handles multiple images linked using the `hs.expand(this)` method within a single page, seamlessly allowing navigation between them.\n\n\n### Working with Flash, Videos, and Other Content\n\nHighslide JS's flexibility extends beyond images.  You can embed Flash objects, videos (via `<iframe>` or `<video>` tags), and other content types using `hs.htmlExpand`.  The key is to correctly structure your HTML and provide the necessary parameters to embed the content properly:\n\n**Example using an iframe for a YouTube video:**\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand({ content: '<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yourVideoID\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', width: 560, height: 340 });\">Watch Video</a>\n```\n\nReplace `\"yourVideoID\"` with your actual YouTube video ID. Similarly, you can adapt this for other video platforms or Flash content. Remember to always consider the dimensions of your embedded content when setting `width` and `height` options for optimal display.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques and Customization\n\n### Customizing the Highslide Interface\n\nHighslide's visual appearance is highly customizable.  You can achieve this primarily through CSS. By inspecting the generated HTML and CSS classes applied by Highslide, you can target specific elements (like the lightbox background, controls, caption area, etc.) and modify their styles to match your website's design.  Create a custom CSS file and link it to your page to override default styles.  This allows you to change colors, fonts, shadows, border styles, and practically any visual aspect of the lightbox.  Remember to be mindful of the class names used by Highslide to ensure your custom CSS targets the correct elements.\n\n\n### Adding JavaScript Event Handlers\n\nHighslide JS provides several events that you can hook into using JavaScript event handlers.  This enables you to execute custom code at specific points during the lightbox's lifecycle (e.g., when it opens, closes, or changes slides).  These events allow for dynamic control and integration with other parts of your website.  Commonly used events include:\n\n* `onOpen`: Triggered when the lightbox opens.\n* `onClose`: Triggered when the lightbox closes.\n* `onBeforeExpand`: Triggered just before the lightbox expands to display content.\n* `onAfterExpand`: Triggered after the lightbox has finished expanding.\n* `onChange`: Triggered when the user navigates to a different slide.\n\nTo add an event handler, you use the `hs.addEvent` function:\n\n```javascript\nhs.addEvent( 'onOpen', function() {\n  // Your custom code here\n  console.log('Highslide opened!');\n});\n```\n\n\n### Using Highslide with AJAX\n\nHighslide's `hs.htmlExpand` function is perfectly suited for integrating with AJAX.  You can use AJAX to dynamically load content into the lightbox instead of relying on pre-loaded HTML.  This allows for creating dynamic galleries with content fetched from a server or a database:\n\n```javascript\n$.ajax({\n  url: 'your-ajax-url.php',\n  success: function(data) {\n    hs.htmlExpand( { content: data, width: 600, height: 400 } );\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis code makes an AJAX request and, upon success, uses the retrieved data (`data`) to populate the content of the Highslide lightbox.  Remember to replace `'your-ajax-url.php'` with the actual URL of your AJAX endpoint.\n\n\n### Integrating with Other JavaScript Libraries\n\nHighslide JS generally plays well with other JavaScript libraries.  However, potential conflicts can arise if libraries attempt to modify the DOM in overlapping ways.  Careful consideration of the order in which scripts are included in your HTML file (placing Highslide's script appropriately) can often resolve such issues.  In cases of persistent conflict, you might need to adjust timing (using timeouts or events) to synchronize actions between the libraries.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Highslide Plugins\n\nFor advanced customization, consider creating custom plugins.  A plugin extends Highslide's functionality by adding new features or modifying existing ones.  This allows for highly specialized interactions and integration within your specific website needs.  Creating a plugin typically involves defining a JavaScript object that conforms to Highslide's plugin interface.\n\n\n### Advanced Configuration Options\n\nBeyond the basic options, Highslide offers a range of advanced settings to finely tune its behavior.  These options, often not readily apparent in initial documentation, allow for precise control over aspects such as:\n\n* **Preloading:**  Control how many images are preloaded and the method used for preloading (e.g., sequential vs. parallel loading).\n* **Transition Effects:**  Customize the animation effects when switching between slides.\n* **Gallery Navigation:**  Adjust the placement and appearance of gallery navigation controls.\n* **Accessibility Features:**  Fine-tune keyboard navigation and screen-reader compatibility.\n* **Error Handling:** Implement custom error handling for failed image loads or other errors.\n* **Caching:** Control how Highslide handles caching of images and other content.\n\n\nConsult the full documentation for a comprehensive list of these advanced configuration options and their usage.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nAccessibility is crucial for a good user experience.  When implementing Highslide, consider these aspects:\n\n* **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure users can fully navigate the gallery and its features using the keyboard alone.  Highslide natively supports keyboard navigation but ensure this functionality is functioning properly.\n* **Screen Reader Compatibility:**  Properly label images and other content to ensure screen readers can convey information accurately to visually impaired users.  Provide alternative text (`alt` attributes) for all images.\n* **ARIA Attributes:**  Consider using appropriate ARIA attributes to further enhance screen reader compatibility and semantic meaning.\n* **Focus Management:** Manage keyboard focus carefully to avoid unexpected behavior or trapped focus.\n* **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background elements within the lightbox for readability.\n\n\nBy proactively addressing these points, you can make your Highslide galleries inclusive and accessible to all users.\n\n\n## Working with Galleries\n\n### Creating and Managing Galleries\n\nHighslide doesn't explicitly define a \"gallery\" object. Instead, a gallery is implicitly created by linking multiple images (or other content) using the `hs.expand(this)` method within your HTML.  Each `<a>` tag with this method call contributes to the gallery.  Highslide automatically handles the transitions and navigation between these linked items.  There's no special setup required beyond ensuring that the linked elements are correctly marked up.  Managing the gallery involves managing the HTML elements and their attributes—adding, removing, or reordering links as needed.\n\n\n### Gallery Navigation and Controls\n\nHighslide provides built-in navigation controls for moving between items in your gallery.  By default, these include \"previous\" and \"next\" buttons within the lightbox.  Users can also navigate using keyboard shortcuts (typically left and right arrow keys). You can customize the appearance of these controls through CSS. While Highslide doesn't offer direct programmatic control over the navigation (like disabling buttons), you can achieve similar effects indirectly using JavaScript event handlers. For example, you can disable the \"next\" button by manipulating the visibility or functionality of the respective HTML elements involved, thereby restricting navigation.\n\n\n### Gallery Thumbnails\n\nWhile Highslide doesn't mandate the use of thumbnails, they significantly enhance the user experience.  Thumbnails are simply smaller versions of your images displayed alongside the main links.  The association between thumbnails and their corresponding full-size images is established by the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag pointing to the large image. This is the method Highslide uses to establish the gallery and navigation. The visual presentation (layout, arrangement) of thumbnails is entirely determined by your HTML and CSS. You can arrange them horizontally, vertically, or in any custom layout.\n\n\n### Gallery Ordering and Sorting\n\nThe order in which your images appear in the gallery is dictated by the order of their associated `<a>` tags within your HTML. To change the order of items in your gallery, simply rearrange the `<a>` tags in your HTML source.  Highslide respects the DOM structure, so any changes to the HTML directly affect the gallery's order.  There is no specific sorting mechanism provided by Highslide; sorting must be handled at the HTML level or externally (e.g., using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM before the Highslide script runs).\n\n\n### Auto-Generating Galleries\n\nHighslide doesn't directly support automatic gallery generation from a data source (like a directory of images).  To create automatically populated galleries, you'll need to employ server-side scripting (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) or client-side JavaScript to:\n\n1. **Fetch the image data:** Retrieve a list of images from a database or file system.\n2. **Generate the HTML:** Dynamically construct the necessary `<a>` tags with the correct `href` and `onclick` attributes based on the image data fetched.\n3. **Insert the HTML:**  Inject this dynamically generated HTML into your webpage where the gallery should appear.\n\nThis approach requires programming beyond the scope of the Highslide JS library itself.  You'll be using Highslide only to display the content dynamically created by your server-side or client-side code.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting and Debugging\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nSeveral common issues arise when working with Highslide JS.  Here are some frequently encountered problems and their solutions:\n\n* **Highslide not displaying:**  Double-check that you've correctly included both the `highslide.js` and `highslide.css` files in your HTML, ensuring the paths are accurate. Verify that there are no JavaScript errors in your browser's console.  Ensure the linked images actually exist at the specified paths.\n* **Images not loading:**  Check for typos in image paths. Ensure that the server is serving the images correctly.  Inspect your browser's network tab to identify any loading errors.  Verify that the necessary image formats are supported.\n* **Incorrect lightbox dimensions:**  Check the `hs.width` and `hs.height` configuration options if the lightbox is not sized appropriately. Ensure that your images have correct dimensions for optimal viewing.\n* **CSS conflicts:**  If the lightbox's styling is unexpected, ensure that your custom CSS isn't overriding Highslide's styles unintentionally. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS applied to the lightbox elements.\n* **JavaScript errors:**  Open your browser's developer console to see any JavaScript errors that may prevent Highslide from functioning correctly. These errors will often provide clues to the problem's source.\n* **Gallery navigation issues:**  Ensure that all links are correctly using `hs.expand(this)` or similar methods. Verify the order of elements in your HTML to match your intended gallery sequence.\n\n\n### Debugging Techniques\n\nEffective debugging involves systematic investigation.  Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Inspect the HTML:**  Carefully check the markup of your links to ensure they are correctly configured for Highslide.\n2. **Check the browser console:**  The browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12) displays JavaScript errors and warnings that can pinpoint problems.\n3. **Simplify your code:**  Temporarily remove custom CSS and JavaScript to see if the problem is caused by conflicting code.  Create a minimal example to isolate the issue.\n4. **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The developer tools allow you to step through the code, inspect the DOM, and view network requests, giving insights into Highslide's behavior.\n5. **Test in different browsers:**  Test your implementation in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to check for cross-browser compatibility issues.\n6. **Consult the Highslide documentation:**  The official Highslide documentation is a valuable resource for troubleshooting and finding answers to common problems.\n7. **Search for similar issues online:** Search online forums and communities (Stack Overflow, etc.) for solutions to problems others have encountered.\n\n\n### Error Messages and Their Meanings\n\nHighslide JS usually doesn't produce extensive error messages. Most problems manifest as the lightbox failing to appear or functioning incorrectly.  JavaScript errors in your browser's console (usually indicating a problem with your custom code or incorrect Highslide configuration) are the most valuable clues. Pay close attention to the line number and error message in your browser's developer tools to quickly locate and fix these errors.  If there are no obvious JavaScript errors, ensure correct paths to images and CSS/JS files are specified.  Common errors involve file paths, incorrect usage of API calls, and CSS conflicts.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance, consider these points:\n\n* **Image Optimization:**  Use appropriately sized images. Optimize images for web use to reduce file sizes without significant quality loss.\n* **Caching:** Configure your web server and browser caching settings effectively to reduce the number of requests made to fetch images.\n* **Preloading:** Utilize Highslide's preloading options to load images before they are needed, improving the perceived speed of the gallery.\n* **Lazy Loading:** If dealing with many images, consider lazy loading techniques (loading images only when they come into the viewport) to avoid unnecessary downloads.\n* **Minimize HTTP Requests:** Reduce the number of HTTP requests by combining CSS and JavaScript files.\n* **Efficient JavaScript:** Write clean, efficient JavaScript code to avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations and calculations that could impact performance.\n* **Minimize DOM Changes:** If using dynamic content, reduce the number of times you're changing the DOM inside `hs.htmlExpand` callbacks.\n\n\nBy following these best practices, you can ensure that your Highslide-powered galleries remain responsive and performant, even with a large number of images.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nThis section provides a reference to the core components of the Highslide JS API.  Note that the exact methods, properties, and events might vary slightly depending on the version of Highslide JS you are using. Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date and comprehensive information.\n\n### Highslide JS Core Objects\n\nHighslide JS primarily revolves around the `hs` object, which holds core functionalities and configuration options.  This object is globally accessible after including the Highslide JS library in your HTML.  The `hs` object serves as the primary interaction point with the library.  Direct manipulation of other internal objects is generally discouraged, as the internal structure of Highslide might change in future versions.  It is best to interact with the library via the documented methods and properties exposed by the `hs` object.\n\n### Highslide JS Methods\n\nHighslide provides several crucial methods for interacting with the lightbox and its content:\n\n* **`hs.expand(element)`:** This is the core function to open the Highslide lightbox.  `element` is typically an `<a>` tag (or a selector string pointing to one), although it can be other suitable DOM elements. This function triggers the display of the content linked to the element.\n\n* **`hs.htmlExpand(element, options)`:**  Displays HTML content or content generated dynamically within the lightbox. `element` can be a DOM element or a configuration object. `options` allows for custom settings for the lightbox display.\n\n* **`hs.close()`:** Closes the currently open Highslide lightbox.\n\n* **`hs.get()`:** Retrieves information about the currently active Highslide instance (e.g., the currently displayed image or the gallery).\n\n* **`hs.addEvent(eventName, eventHandler)`:** Attaches a custom event handler to a Highslide event. (`eventName` is the event name, `eventHandler` is the function to execute).\n\n* **`hs.removeEvent(eventName, eventHandler)`:** Detaches an event handler previously attached with `hs.addEvent`.\n\nThese are essential methods; the complete API reference in the official documentation contains a detailed explanation of each method's parameters and return values.\n\n### Highslide JS Events\n\nHighslide triggers various events during its operation, allowing you to execute custom code at specific points:\n\n* **`onOpen`:** Fired when the lightbox is opened.\n* **`onClose`:** Fired when the lightbox is closed.\n* **`onBeforeExpand`:** Fired just before the lightbox expands to display content.\n* **`onAfterExpand`:** Fired after the lightbox has fully expanded.\n* **`onChange`:** Fired when the user navigates to a different item in the gallery.\n* **`onError`:** Fired when an error occurs (e.g., image loading failure).\n\n\nYou can attach event handlers to these events using `hs.addEvent()` to integrate custom behaviors.  Remember to use descriptive event handler names to improve code readability and maintainability.  The event object passed to the handler typically includes information relevant to the event.\n\n### Highslide JS Options\n\nHighslide's behavior and appearance are heavily customizable through numerous options. These options are set by assigning values to properties of the global `hs` object:\n\n* **`hs.graphicsDir`:** Path to the Highslide graphics directory.\n* **`hs.align`:** Alignment of the lightbox within the viewport (e.g., 'center', 'top left').\n* **`hs.expandDuration`:** Duration of the expand animation.\n* **`hs.fadeInOut`:** Enables fade-in/fade-out effects.\n* **`hs.overlayOpacity`:** Opacity of the dimming overlay.\n* **`hs.dimmingOpacity`:** Opacity of the dimming effect.\n* **`hs.showCredits`:** Whether to display Highslide credits.\n* **`hs.width`, `hs.height`:** Dimensions of the lightbox.\n* **`hs.transitions`:** Array of transition types to use.\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.  Many more options are available for controlling various aspects of Highslide. The official documentation provides a complete list and descriptions of each option.  Careful configuration of these options is key to integrating Highslide smoothly into your web application.  Using the correct option names and data types is crucial.  Incorrect configurations may result in unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n\n## Examples and Use Cases\n\nThis section provides practical examples demonstrating various uses of Highslide JS. Remember to replace placeholder file paths and URLs with your actual data.  Also ensure that you've correctly included the Highslide JS library and CSS in your HTML file.\n\n### Image Gallery Example\n\nThis example shows a simple image gallery with thumbnails:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Highslide Image Gallery</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"highslide.css\" />\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"highslide.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nhs.graphicsDir = 'graphics/';\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<a href=\"images/large1.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"images/thumb1.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\" width=\"100\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"images/large2.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"images/thumb2.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\" width=\"100\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"images/large3.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this)\">\n  <img src=\"images/thumb3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\" width=\"100\" />\n</a>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `\"images/large1.jpg\"`, `\"images/thumb1.jpg\"`, etc. with the actual paths to your large and thumbnail images.  Ensure the `graphics` directory (containing Highslide's graphics) exists in the same directory as your HTML file or adjust `hs.graphicsDir` accordingly.\n\n\n### Image Zoom Example\n\nThis example demonstrates zooming into an image using Highslide:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"images/large_image.jpg\" onclick=\"return hs.expand(this, {  slideshowGroup: 'group1' });\">\n    <img src=\"images/large_image.jpg\" alt=\"Zoomable Image\" />\n</a>\n```\nThis uses the default zoom functionality of Highslide.  Adjust the image source as needed.  Adding `slideshowGroup` allows for simple slideshow functionality if you have multiple similar images on the page.\n\n\n### Ajax Content Example\n\nThis example fetches content via AJAX and displays it in the lightbox:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return loadAjaxContent();\">Load Content via AJAX</a>\n\n<script>\nfunction loadAjaxContent() {\n  $.ajax({\n    url: 'ajax_content.html',\n    success: function(data) {\n      hs.htmlExpand( { content: data, width: 600, height: 400 } );\n    }\n  });\n  return false;\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nReplace `'ajax_content.html'` with the URL of your AJAX endpoint that returns the HTML content to be displayed.  This assumes you are using jQuery for AJAX; adapt as needed for other AJAX libraries.\n\n\n### Flash Content Example\n\nThis example embeds a Flash object within Highslide (note that Flash is largely deprecated; consider alternatives like HTML5 video):\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand({ content: '<object type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" data=\\\"flash_content.swf\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"300\\\"></object>', width: 400, height: 300 });\">View Flash Content</a>\n```\n\nReplace `\"flash_content.swf\"` with the path to your Flash file.  Ensure the necessary Flash plugin is installed in the user's browser (though its usage is now very limited).\n\n\n### Video Content Example\n\nThis example uses an iframe to embed a YouTube video:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return hs.htmlExpand({ content: '<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', width: 560, height: 340 });\">View YouTube Video</a>\n```\n\nReplace `\"VIDEO_ID\"` with the actual YouTube video ID.  You can adapt this example for other video platforms by modifying the iframe source URL.  Always consider appropriate dimensions for the video embed within the lightbox.\n\n\nRemember to adapt these examples to your specific needs and context.  Consult the full documentation for advanced customization and further examples.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"css":["../../styles.css"],"html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"},"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html","../../schema.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
