It allows you to quickly and easily add interactive pop-up windows to your website without needing extensive knowledge of JavaScript or complex frameworks.  SimpleModal handles the complexities of modal creation, positioning, and interaction, leaving you to focus on the content and functionality within the modal itself.\n\n\n### Why use SimpleModal?\n\nSimpleModal provides several advantages over manually coding modals or using heavier, more complex JavaScript libraries:\n\n* **Simplicity:**  Its minimal codebase makes it easy to learn and implement.  The API is intuitive and straightforward.\n* **Lightweight:** SimpleModal adds minimal overhead to your website, resulting in faster loading times and improved performance.\n* **Customization:** While easy to use out-of-the-box, it offers extensive options for customization, allowing you to tailor the appearance and behavior of your modals to perfectly match your website's design.\n* **Accessibility:** SimpleModal is designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to best practices to ensure usability for all users.\n* **Cross-browser compatibility:**  It works reliably across a wide range of modern web browsers.\n\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Easy setup and usage:** Simple integration with minimal code required.\n* **Customizable appearance:**  Control the modal's size, position, styling, and more through options and CSS.\n* **Various opening and closing methods:**  Support for various trigger events (clicks, form submissions, etc.).\n* **Support for content loading:**  Ability to dynamically load content into the modal.\n* **Keyboard navigation:** Users can navigate and interact with the modal using keyboard shortcuts.\n* **Accessibility features:**  Built-in features to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.\n\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nSimpleModal is designed to be compatible with a wide range of modern web browsers.  It has been thoroughly tested and works well on the following browsers:\n\n* Google Chrome (latest versions)\n* Mozilla Firefox (latest versions)\n* Safari (latest versions)\n* Microsoft Edge (latest versions)\n* Internet Explorer (limited support, may require workarounds for older versions).  Note:  Support for older versions of Internet Explorer is not guaranteed and may be deprecated in future releases.  We strongly recommend using modern browsers for optimal performance and compatibility.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\nSimpleModal can be easily integrated into your project using several methods:\n\n* **Download:** Download the latest release from [link to download - replace with actual link]. Extract the contents and include the `simplemodal.js` file in your project.\n\n* **CDN:**  Include SimpleModal using a CDN link directly in your HTML file's `<head>` section.  A commonly used CDN is [link to CDN - replace with actual link].  This method avoids the need to download and manage the library locally.  For example:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"[CDN link to simplemodal.js]\"></script>\n```\n\n* **NPM (Node Package Manager):** If you're using npm for your project, you can install SimpleModal using:\n\n```bash\nnpm install simplemodal\n```\nThen import it into your JavaScript code (example using ES6 modules):\n\n```javascript\nimport SimpleModal from 'simplemodal'; \n// ... your code using SimpleModal ...\n```\n\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nOnce SimpleModal is included in your project, creating a modal involves a few simple steps:\n\n1. **Create the modal content:** This is the HTML content that will appear inside the modal.  This can be an existing element on your page or dynamically created HTML.\n\n2. **Select a trigger element:** This is the element (usually a button or link) that will open the modal when clicked.\n\n3. **Initialize SimpleModal:** Use the SimpleModal function to attach the modal to the trigger element.  This involves passing options (if needed) to customize the modal's appearance and behavior.\n\n4. **(Optional) Customize appearance:** Use CSS to style the modal to match your websiteâ€™s design. SimpleModal provides default styling, but this can be easily overridden.\n\n\n### Including SimpleModal in your project\n\nRegardless of the installation method, ensure that the `simplemodal.js` file is included in your HTML document *before* the script that uses it. This is typically done within the `<head>` section of your HTML:\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>My Page with SimpleModal</title>\n  <script src=\"simplemodal.js\"></script> <!-- Or the CDN link -->\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"simplemodal.css\"> <!-- If using a separate CSS file -->\n</head>\n<body>\n  <!-- Your HTML content goes here -->\n  <script>\n    // Your SimpleModal initialization code here\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n### First Simple Modal Example\n\nLet's create a simple modal with a message.  First, create the HTML for the modal content (this could be anywhere in your HTML, but often it's hidden by default with `display:none;`):\n\n```html\n<div id=\"simplemodal-content\">\n  <p>This is my first SimpleModal!</p>\n</div>\n```\n\nThen, add a button to trigger the modal:\n\n```html\n<button id=\"open-modal\">Open Modal</button>\n```\n\nFinally, add this JavaScript code (after including SimpleModal) to initialize and show the modal:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $('#open-modal').click(function(e) {\n    $('#simplemodal-content').modal();\n    e.preventDefault();\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"simplemodal.js\"` with the actual path to the SimpleModal file. This example uses jQuery; if you're not using jQuery, the initialization process would differ slightly (refer to the SimpleModal documentation for non-jQuery usage).  This will create a basic modal that opens when the button is clicked.  You can customize this significantly with further options as documented in later sections.\n\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n### Opening and Closing Modals\n\nSimpleModal provides several ways to open and close modals:\n\n* **Opening:** The most common way to open a modal is by attaching a click event handler to a trigger element (e.g., a button).  When the trigger is clicked, the `modal()` function is called on the modal content element.  Example using jQuery:\n\n```javascript\n$('#myButton').click(function(e) {\n  $('#myModalContent').modal();\n  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent default link behavior if applicable\n});\n```\n\n* **Closing:** Modals can be closed programmatically using the `close()` method:\n\n```javascript\n$('#myModalContent').modal('close');\n```\n\nModals can also be closed by clicking the close button that SimpleModal automatically adds (usually an 'X' in the top-right corner) or by pressing the Escape key.\n\n\n### Modal Content\n\nThe content of your modal can be anything you can put inside a standard HTML element.  This includes:\n\n* **Static HTML:**  Simply place your HTML directly within the element that you're making into a modal.\n\n* **Dynamically Loaded Content:** You can load content into the modal using AJAX or other techniques.  This is useful for loading content on demand to improve performance.\n\n* **Forms:** You can easily include forms within your modal. SimpleModal will handle the form's interaction within the modal context.\n\n\n### Styling Modals\n\nSimpleModal provides default styles for modals. However, you can easily customize the appearance by using CSS.  SimpleModal applies classes to the modal and its elements, allowing you to target specific aspects of the modal's design using CSS selectors.  Check the SimpleModal documentation or the provided CSS file for the specific class names used.  For example, you might target the modal container using a selector like `.simplemodal-container`.   You can override default styles by adding your own CSS rules with higher specificity.\n\n\n### Customizing Modal Appearance\n\nBeyond basic CSS styling, SimpleModal provides options to further customize the modal's behavior and appearance. These options are typically passed as an object to the `modal()` function.   Examples include:\n\n* `minWidth`: Sets the minimum width of the modal.\n* `minHeight`: Sets the minimum height of the modal.\n* `maxWidth`: Sets the maximum width of the modal.\n* `maxHeight`: Sets the maximum height of the modal.\n* `overlayClose`: Allows closing the modal by clicking on the overlay.\n* `opacity`: Sets the opacity of the modal overlay.\n* `position`: Controls the modal's position on the screen.\n\n\nRefer to the SimpleModal documentation for a complete list of available options and their usage.\n\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\nSimpleModal strives to provide accessible modal experiences. Key aspects include:\n\n* **Keyboard Navigation:** Users should be able to navigate and close the modal using keyboard shortcuts (Escape key, Tab key, etc.).\n* **ARIA Attributes:** SimpleModal uses appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) to enhance accessibility for screen readers.\n* **Focus Management:**  SimpleModal handles focus management within the modal, ensuring that focus is correctly set within the modal content.\n* **Contrast and Visual Clarity:**  Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to meet accessibility guidelines.  Use clear and descriptive labels for interactive elements within the modal.\n\n\nAlways test your modal implementation with assistive technologies (screen readers) to verify accessibility.  Adjust styles and ARIA attributes as needed to ensure your modal is fully usable for all users.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Handling Events\n\nSimpleModal allows you to listen for and respond to various events related to the modal's lifecycle.  This can be done using jQuery's `on()` method or a similar approach depending on your chosen JavaScript framework.  Common events include:\n\n* `'open'`: Triggered when the modal is opened.\n* `'close'`: Triggered when the modal is closed.\n* `'show'`: Triggered after the modal becomes visible.\n* `'hide'`: Triggered before the modal becomes hidden.\n\n\nExample using jQuery:\n\n```javascript\n$('#myModalContent').on('open', function() {\n  console.log('Modal opened!');\n});\n\n$('#myModalContent').on('close', function() {\n  console.log('Modal closed!');\n  // Perform cleanup actions here, if needed.\n});\n```\n\n\n### Using Callbacks\n\nCallbacks provide a way to execute custom functions before or after certain modal actions.  These are often more concise than using event listeners for simple actions.  Some SimpleModal functions may accept callback functions as parameters.  Consult the SimpleModal documentation for specific functions that support callbacks.  For instance, a callback might be used to perform actions after the modal is successfully closed.\n\n\n### Dynamic Content Loading\n\nInstead of pre-defining the modal's content in the HTML, you can dynamically load it. This is particularly useful when you need to retrieve data from a server or generate content based on user input.  You can achieve this using AJAX or fetching data using `fetch()`.  Load the content into your modal element *before* calling `modal()`.\n\n\nExample using `fetch()`:\n\n```javascript\nfetch('/my-data-endpoint')\n  .then(response => response.text())\n  .then(data => {\n    $('#myModalContent').html(data);\n    $('#myModalContent').modal();\n  });\n```\n\n\n### Working with Forms\n\nSimpleModal seamlessly integrates with HTML forms.  You can place forms within your modal content, and the form submission will work as expected.  However, you might need to handle form submission within the modal's context (e.g., preventing the default form submission behavior and handling it with AJAX to avoid page reloads).  You can also use events like `'close'` to handle form data after the modal is closed.\n\n\n### Ajax Integration\n\nAjax integration allows you to load modal content dynamically from a server without refreshing the entire page.  This is crucial for improving user experience and providing a more responsive interface. Use AJAX libraries (like jQuery's `$.ajax()` or the `fetch()` API) to retrieve data from your server.  Populate the modal content with the received data before showing the modal.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Modal Components\n\nFor more complex modals, you can create reusable custom modal components.  Structure your modal content in a way that is easily reusable. You can create custom HTML templates and JavaScript functions to manage the modal's behavior.  This promotes code reusability and keeps your code organized, particularly in larger projects.  Consider using a component-based approach if your framework or library supports it (like React, Vue, or Angular).\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### SimpleModal Object\n\nThe core of SimpleModal is the `SimpleModal` object (or a similar named object depending on your implementation/framework).  This object (or a function that returns it) is what you use to create and manage your modals.  Its properties and methods allow you to control the modal's behavior and appearance.  The exact structure might depend slightly on the version or whether you are using a jQuery plugin version versus a standalone version, but the core functionality should be similar.\n\n**Note:**  The specific method names and available options can vary slightly based on the SimpleModal version and integration method (e.g., whether you're using a jQuery plugin or a standalone version).  Always refer to the documentation for the specific version you are using.\n\n\n### Methods\n\nThe `SimpleModal` object typically provides several methods for interacting with modals:\n\n* **`modal()` (or similar):** This is the primary method to initialize and display a modal.  It usually takes the modal content element (as a selector or jQuery object) as its first argument and an optional configuration object as its second argument (containing options to customize the modal).\n\n* **`close()`:** This method closes the currently open modal.\n\n* **`show()`:** This method (if available) explicitly shows the modal (might be implicit in `modal()` in some implementations).\n\n* **`hide()`:** This method (if available) explicitly hides the modal.\n\n* **Other methods:** Depending on the implementation, additional methods might be available for specific actions like setting options, getting the modal's state, etc.  Refer to your SimpleModal documentation for details.\n\n\n### Properties\n\nThe `SimpleModal` object, or the instantiated modal object, may expose certain properties:\n\n* **`isOpen` (or similar):** A boolean value indicating whether the modal is currently open.\n\n* **`options` (or similar):**  An object containing the current configuration options of the modal. This might be read-only.\n\n* **`element` (or similar):** A reference to the modal's root DOM element.\n\n\n### Events\n\nSimpleModal triggers various events during its lifecycle.  You can listen for these events using standard JavaScript event listeners (like `addEventListener`) or jQuery's `.on()` method, depending on your integration.  Key events usually include:\n\n* **`open`:** Fired when the modal is opened.\n\n* **`close`:** Fired when the modal is closed.\n\n* **`show`:** Fired after the modal becomes visible.\n\n* **`hide`:** Fired before the modal becomes hidden.\n\n* **`beforeOpen`:** (if available) Fired immediately before the modal opens.  This allows canceling the opening process if needed.\n\n* **`beforeClose`:** (if available) Fired immediately before the modal closes.  This allows canceling the closing process if needed.\n\nYou can use these events to perform actions in response to modal state changes.  For example, you might use the `'close'` event to perform cleanup or submit a form.  Remember that event names and their exact behavior might vary slightly based on the version of SimpleModal you are using.  Refer to the specific documentation for your version.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Modal not appearing:** This is often caused by issues with including the SimpleModal library correctly,  conflicts with other JavaScript libraries, incorrect selectors for modal content or trigger elements, or missing or incorrect CSS.  Check the browser's developer console for JavaScript errors. Ensure that your modal content is properly structured and that the trigger element is correctly associated with it.\n\n* **Modal styling issues:**  Style conflicts with your website's CSS can lead to unexpected modal appearance.  Inspect the modal element using your browser's developer tools to determine which CSS rules are being applied and adjust your CSS accordingly to ensure the desired styling. Make sure your CSS is correctly linked and has the proper specificity to override default SimpleModal styles.\n\n* **JavaScript errors:**  Errors in your JavaScript code (particularly when initializing or interacting with the modal) will prevent it from functioning correctly.  Check your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors and carefully review your code for syntax mistakes and logical flaws.\n\n* **Modal overlapping or positioning issues:** This is often due to conflicts with other elements on the page, incorrect positioning settings, or z-index problems.  Check the CSS `z-index` property for modal elements to ensure that the modal appears on top of other elements. Inspect your page layout with browser developer tools to pinpoint overlapping elements.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) in your browser provide valuable information about JavaScript errors, network requests, and CSS styles.  Use the console to examine error messages and the debugger to step through your code.\n\n* **Simplify your code:**  If you have complex code interacting with SimpleModal, try to isolate the problem by temporarily removing or commenting out sections of your code to determine which part is causing the issue.\n\n* **Check the SimpleModal documentation:** The official documentation provides examples, API references, and known issues that may help identify and fix problems.\n\n* **Test in different browsers:**  Test your implementation in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.  Differences in browser behavior might reveal the root cause of an issue.\n\n* **Search online forums and communities:**  Search online forums and communities related to SimpleModal or JavaScript for solutions to common problems.  Many issues that you encounter have likely been experienced by others before.\n\n\n### Error Messages\n\nPay close attention to any error messages displayed in your browser's developer console.  These messages provide clues about the nature and location of the error in your code.  Common error types include:\n\n* **`ReferenceError`:** Indicates that a variable or function is not defined.\n* **`TypeError`:** Indicates an operation on an object of the incorrect type.\n* **`SyntaxError`:** Indicates a syntax problem in your JavaScript code.\n\nCarefully analyze the error message, including line numbers and error details, to pinpoint and fix the problem.\n\n\n### Support and Community\n\nIf you encounter issues that you cannot resolve on your own, consider:\n\n* **Checking the SimpleModal project's website:** The project's website may have a support section, FAQ, or a forum where you can ask questions and find answers.\n* **Searching online forums:** Search for solutions on websites such as Stack Overflow or GitHub issues.\n* **Contacting the project maintainers:** If you can't find a solution elsewhere, you might consider contacting the maintainers of the SimpleModal project directly (if contact information is provided).  When reporting a problem, provide as much detail as possible, including your code, browser details, and steps to reproduce the error.\n\nRemember to always search existing resources and documentation before seeking direct support to find solutions more efficiently.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples assume you have included SimpleModal correctly in your project (see the \"Getting Started\" section).  Adapt these examples to your specific needs and remember to replace placeholder IDs and paths with your actual values.  Also, ensure any required CSS is included to style the modals appropriately.\n\n\n### Basic Modal Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple modal displaying a message:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<button id=\"open-basic-modal\">Open Basic Modal</button>\n<div id=\"basic-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <p>This is a basic modal!</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-basic-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#basic-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n\n\n### Form Modal Example\n\nThis example shows a modal containing a simple form:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<button id=\"open-form-modal\">Open Form Modal</button>\n<div id=\"form-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <form>\n    <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\"><br><br>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n  </form>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-form-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#form-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n\n$('#form-modal-content form').submit(function(e) {\n  // Handle form submission here (e.g., using AJAX)\n  e.preventDefault();\n  //Example using alert:\n  alert(\"Form submitted!\");\n  $('#form-modal-content').modal('close');\n});\n```\n\n\n### Image Modal Example\n\nThis example displays a large image in a modal:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"my-image.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" id=\"open-image-modal\">\n<div id=\"image-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <img src=\"my-image.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" style=\"max-width:100%;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-image-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#image-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n\n\n### Custom Modal Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a more customized modal with a title and custom close button:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<button id=\"open-custom-modal\">Open Custom Modal</button>\n<div id=\"custom-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <h3>Custom Modal Title</h3>\n  <p>This is a custom modal with a title and custom close button.</p>\n  <button id=\"custom-close-button\">Close</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-custom-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#custom-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n\n$('#custom-close-button').click(function() {\n  $('#custom-modal-content').modal('close');\n});\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the CSS to style these modals according to your preferences.  The styling would be done in a separate CSS file linked to your HTML.  These are basic examples.  More advanced examples would involve dynamic content loading, more complex forms, and more extensive use of SimpleModal's options and events.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Introduction\n\n### What is SimpleModal?\n\nSimpleModal is a lightweight, easy-to-use JavaScript library for creating modal dialog boxes (or simply, \"modals\") on web pages.

Common events include:\n\n* `'open'`: Triggered when the modal is opened.\n* `'close'`: Triggered when the modal is closed.\n* `'show'`: Triggered after the modal becomes visible.\n* `'hide'`: Triggered before the modal becomes hidden.\n\n\nExample using jQuery:\n\n```javascript\n$('#myModalContent').on('open', function() {\n  console.log('Modal opened!');\n});\n\n$('#myModalContent').on('close', function() {\n  console.log('Modal closed!');\n  // Perform cleanup actions here, if needed.\n});\n```\n\n\n### Using Callbacks\n\nCallbacks provide a way to execute custom functions before or after certain modal actions.  These are often more concise than using event listeners for simple actions.  Some SimpleModal functions may accept callback functions as parameters.  Consult the SimpleModal documentation for specific functions that support callbacks.  For instance, a callback might be used to perform actions after the modal is successfully closed.\n\n\n### Dynamic Content Loading\n\nInstead of pre-defining the modal's content in the HTML, you can dynamically load it. This is particularly useful when you need to retrieve data from a server or generate content based on user input.  You can achieve this using AJAX or fetching data using `fetch()`.  Load the content into your modal element *before* calling `modal()`.\n\n\nExample using `fetch()`:\n\n```javascript\nfetch('/my-data-endpoint')\n  .then(response => response.text())\n  .then(data => {\n    $('#myModalContent').html(data);\n    $('#myModalContent').modal();\n  });\n```\n\n\n### Working with Forms\n\nSimpleModal seamlessly integrates with HTML forms.  You can place forms within your modal content, and the form submission will work as expected.  However, you might need to handle form submission within the modal's context (e.g., preventing the default form submission behavior and handling it with AJAX to avoid page reloads).  You can also use events like `'close'` to handle form data after the modal is closed.\n\n\n### Ajax Integration\n\nAjax integration allows you to load modal content dynamically from a server without refreshing the entire page.  This is crucial for improving user experience and providing a more responsive interface. Use AJAX libraries (like jQuery's `$.ajax()` or the `fetch()` API) to retrieve data from your server.  Populate the modal content with the received data before showing the modal.\n\n\n### Creating Custom Modal Components\n\nFor more complex modals, you can create reusable custom modal components.  Structure your modal content in a way that is easily reusable. You can create custom HTML templates and JavaScript functions to manage the modal's behavior.  This promotes code reusability and keeps your code organized, particularly in larger projects.  Consider using a component-based approach if your framework or library supports it (like React, Vue, or Angular).\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### SimpleModal Object\n\nThe core of SimpleModal is the `SimpleModal` object (or a similar named object depending on your implementation/framework).  This object (or a function that returns it) is what you use to create and manage your modals.  Its properties and methods allow you to control the modal's behavior and appearance.  The exact structure might depend slightly on the version or whether you are using a jQuery plugin version versus a standalone version, but the core functionality should be similar.\n\n**Note:**  The specific method names and available options can vary slightly based on the SimpleModal version and integration method (e.g., whether you're using a jQuery plugin or a standalone version).  Always refer to the documentation for the specific version you are using.\n\n\n### Methods\n\nThe `SimpleModal` object typically provides several methods for interacting with modals:\n\n* **`modal()` (or similar):** This is the primary method to initialize and display a modal.  It usually takes the modal content element (as a selector or jQuery object) as its first argument and an optional configuration object as its second argument (containing options to customize the modal).\n\n* **`close()`:** This method closes the currently open modal.\n\n* **`show()`:** This method (if available) explicitly shows the modal (might be implicit in `modal()` in some implementations).\n\n* **`hide()`:** This method (if available) explicitly hides the modal.\n\n* **Other methods:** Depending on the implementation, additional methods might be available for specific actions like setting options, getting the modal's state, etc.  Refer to your SimpleModal documentation for details.\n\n\n### Properties\n\nThe `SimpleModal` object, or the instantiated modal object, may expose certain properties:\n\n* **`isOpen` (or similar):** A boolean value indicating whether the modal is currently open.\n\n* **`options` (or similar):**  An object containing the current configuration options of the modal. This might be read-only.\n\n* **`element` (or similar):** A reference to the modal's root DOM element.\n\n\n### Events\n\nSimpleModal triggers various events during its lifecycle.  You can listen for these events using standard JavaScript event listeners (like `addEventListener`) or jQuery's `.on()` method, depending on your integration.  Key events usually include:\n\n* **`open`:** Fired when the modal is opened.\n\n* **`close`:** Fired when the modal is closed.\n\n* **`show`:** Fired after the modal becomes visible.\n\n* **`hide`:** Fired before the modal becomes hidden.\n\n* **`beforeOpen`:** (if available) Fired immediately before the modal opens.  This allows canceling the opening process if needed.\n\n* **`beforeClose`:** (if available) Fired immediately before the modal closes.  This allows canceling the closing process if needed.\n\nYou can use these events to perform actions in response to modal state changes.  For example, you might use the `'close'` event to perform cleanup or submit a form.  Remember that event names and their exact behavior might vary slightly based on the version of SimpleModal you are using.  Refer to the specific documentation for your version.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n* **Modal not appearing:** This is often caused by issues with including the SimpleModal library correctly,  conflicts with other JavaScript libraries, incorrect selectors for modal content or trigger elements, or missing or incorrect CSS.  Check the browser's developer console for JavaScript errors. Ensure that your modal content is properly structured and that the trigger element is correctly associated with it.\n\n* **Modal styling issues:**  Style conflicts with your website's CSS can lead to unexpected modal appearance.  Inspect the modal element using your browser's developer tools to determine which CSS rules are being applied and adjust your CSS accordingly to ensure the desired styling. Make sure your CSS is correctly linked and has the proper specificity to override default SimpleModal styles.\n\n* **JavaScript errors:**  Errors in your JavaScript code (particularly when initializing or interacting with the modal) will prevent it from functioning correctly.  Check your browser's developer console for JavaScript errors and carefully review your code for syntax mistakes and logical flaws.\n\n* **Modal overlapping or positioning issues:** This is often due to conflicts with other elements on the page, incorrect positioning settings, or z-index problems.  Check the CSS `z-index` property for modal elements to ensure that the modal appears on top of other elements. Inspect your page layout with browser developer tools to pinpoint overlapping elements.\n\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n* **Use your browser's developer tools:**  The developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) in your browser provide valuable information about JavaScript errors, network requests, and CSS styles.  Use the console to examine error messages and the debugger to step through your code.\n\n* **Simplify your code:**  If you have complex code interacting with SimpleModal, try to isolate the problem by temporarily removing or commenting out sections of your code to determine which part is causing the issue.\n\n* **Check the SimpleModal documentation:** The official documentation provides examples, API references, and known issues that may help identify and fix problems.\n\n* **Test in different browsers:**  Test your implementation in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.  Differences in browser behavior might reveal the root cause of an issue.\n\n* **Search online forums and communities:**  Search online forums and communities related to SimpleModal or JavaScript for solutions to common problems.  Many issues that you encounter have likely been experienced by others before.\n\n\n### Error Messages\n\nPay close attention to any error messages displayed in your browser's developer console.  These messages provide clues about the nature and location of the error in your code.  Common error types include:\n\n* **`ReferenceError`:** Indicates that a variable or function is not defined.\n* **`TypeError`:** Indicates an operation on an object of the incorrect type.\n* **`SyntaxError`:** Indicates a syntax problem in your JavaScript code.\n\nCarefully analyze the error message, including line numbers and error details, to pinpoint and fix the problem.\n\n\n### Support and Community\n\nIf you encounter issues that you cannot resolve on your own, consider:\n\n* **Checking the SimpleModal project's website:** The project's website may have a support section, FAQ, or a forum where you can ask questions and find answers.\n* **Searching online forums:** Search for solutions on websites such as Stack Overflow or GitHub issues.\n* **Contacting the project maintainers:** If you can't find a solution elsewhere, you might consider contacting the maintainers of the SimpleModal project directly (if contact information is provided).  When reporting a problem, provide as much detail as possible, including your code, browser details, and steps to reproduce the error.\n\nRemember to always search existing resources and documentation before seeking direct support to find solutions more efficiently.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples assume you have included SimpleModal correctly in your project (see the \"Getting Started\" section).  Adapt these examples to your specific needs and remember to replace placeholder IDs and paths with your actual values.  Also, ensure any required CSS is included to style the modals appropriately.\n\n\n### Basic Modal Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple modal displaying a message:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<button id=\"open-basic-modal\">Open Basic Modal</button>\n<div id=\"basic-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <p>This is a basic modal!</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-basic-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#basic-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n\n\n### Form Modal Example\n\nThis example shows a modal containing a simple form:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<button id=\"open-form-modal\">Open Form Modal</button>\n<div id=\"form-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <form>\n    <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\"><br><br>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n  </form>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-form-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#form-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n\n$('#form-modal-content form').submit(function(e) {\n  // Handle form submission here (e.g., using AJAX)\n  e.preventDefault();\n  //Example using alert:\n  alert(\"Form submitted!\");\n  $('#form-modal-content').modal('close');\n});\n```\n\n\n### Image Modal Example\n\nThis example displays a large image in a modal:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"my-image.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" id=\"open-image-modal\">\n<div id=\"image-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <img src=\"my-image.jpg\" alt=\"My Image\" style=\"max-width:100%;\">\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-image-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#image-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n\n\n### Custom Modal Example\n\nThis example demonstrates a more customized modal with a title and custom close button:\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<button id=\"open-custom-modal\">Open Custom Modal</button>\n<div id=\"custom-modal-content\" style=\"display:none;\">\n  <h3>Custom Modal Title</h3>\n  <p>This is a custom modal with a title and custom close button.</p>\n  <button id=\"custom-close-button\">Close</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n**JavaScript (using jQuery):**\n\n```javascript\n$('#open-custom-modal').click(function(e) {\n  $('#custom-modal-content').modal();\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n\n$('#custom-close-button').click(function() {\n  $('#custom-modal-content').modal('close');\n});\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the CSS to style these modals according to your preferences.  The styling would be done in a separate CSS file linked to your HTML.  These are basic examples.  More advanced examples would involve dynamic content loading, more complex forms, and more extensive use of SimpleModal's options and events.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
