## Getting Started

### Creating a Slideshow

To create a new slideshow, launch the Camera Slideshow application.  Upon launch, you will be presented with the main interface. Click on the "New Slideshow" button (or equivalent menu option).  A new, empty slideshow project will be created.  You can now begin adding images and configuring settings.  The project will be automatically saved at regular intervals to prevent data loss, however it's recommended to manually save the project frequently as well using the "Save" or "Save As" options in the File menu.  Project files are saved with the extension ".csshow".


### Adding Images

Images can be added to the slideshow via drag-and-drop from your file explorer or by using the "Add Images" button (or equivalent menu option).  This will open a file dialog allowing you to select one or multiple image files. Supported image formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and BMP.  Once added, images will appear in the slideshow timeline. You can rearrange the order of images by dragging and dropping them within the timeline.  The maximum number of images per slideshow is [Insert Maximum Number Here].


### Basic Configuration

Basic slideshow configuration options are accessible via the "Settings" menu or a dedicated settings panel. Key settings include:

* **Transition Type:** Select from a variety of transition effects (fade, slide, wipe, etc.).
* **Transition Speed:** Adjust the speed of the transitions (in seconds or milliseconds).
* **Image Duration:** Set the duration each image is displayed (in seconds).
* **Background Music:** Add a music file (MP3, WAV, etc.) from your system to play during the slideshow.  Ensure the file is in a supported audio format.
* **Resolution:** Choose the output resolution for the exported video.


### Running the Slideshow

Once images have been added and settings configured, you can preview the slideshow by clicking the "Play" button.  This will begin playback of the slideshow in the application's preview window.  Any changes made to the slideshow's configuration will be reflected in the preview upon clicking "Play" again.  To export the slideshow as a video file, click the "Export" button (or equivalent menu option).  Select the desired output format and location, then click "Export" to begin the video rendering process. The export time will depend on the slideshow's length, the chosen resolution, and your system's processing power.


## Image Management

### Adding Images from Files

Images can be added from local file storage using the "Add Images" button or by dragging and dropping image files directly onto the slideshow timeline.  The supported image formats are JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and BMP.  When using the "Add Images" button, a standard file selection dialog will appear, allowing you to select multiple files at once.  After selecting images, they will be added to the end of the slideshow timeline.


### Adding Images from URLs

Camera Slideshow supports adding images directly from URLs.  Use the "Add Image from URL" button (or equivalent menu option).  Paste the URL of the image into the provided field and click "Add". The application will attempt to download and add the image to the slideshow.  Note that the application will only support images from URLs that allow access for download. The application will not download images which require authentication.   Error handling is included to inform the user if the image fails to load from a given URL.


### Removing Images

To remove an image from the slideshow, select the image in the timeline.  Then, click the "Remove Image" button (or equivalent menu option), or use the delete key on your keyboard.  A confirmation dialog may appear to prevent accidental image deletion.  Removed images will be permanently removed from the current slideshow project unless it has been saved recently;  unsaved changes are not automatically backed up.


### Reordering Images

Images in the slideshow timeline can be reordered by dragging and dropping them to the desired position.  Click and hold the image you want to move, drag it to its new position, and release the mouse button.  The order of images will be updated accordingly.  This change will be immediately reflected in the preview (if one is currently open).


### Image Formatting Options

While Camera Slideshow's primary focus is slideshow creation, basic image formatting options are available. These options may be accessed by selecting an image within the timeline. Right-clicking on a selected image may reveal a contextual menu containing these options, or they may be accessed through a dedicated panel. Currently supported options include:

* **Cropping:** Crop the image to remove unwanted portions.  A cropping tool with adjustable boundaries will appear for precise cropping.
* **Resizing:** Resize the image to a specific width and height, maintaining the aspect ratio or allowing for distortion.  Options to resize using percentages or pixel values will be provided.
* **Rotation:** Rotate the image clockwise or counter-clockwise by 90-degree increments.




## Slideshow Configuration

### Transition Effects

Camera Slideshow offers a variety of transition effects to smoothly move between images in the slideshow. These effects are selectable on a per-transition basis (between each image pair) or a global setting that applies to all transitions within the slideshow.  The available transition effects include, but are not limited to: fade, wipe, slide, crossfade, and zoom. Each transition effect has its own visual characteristics and timing.  The specific list of available effects and their visual representation can be found in the application's settings or documentation.


### Transition Speed

The speed of each transition effect can be adjusted.  This setting controls how quickly the transition occurs between images.  Transition speed is typically measured in seconds or milliseconds.  The user can specify a global transition speed that applies to all transitions, or define custom speeds for individual transitions.  A preview feature allows users to see the effect of changing the transition speed before finalizing the setting.


### Looping

Looping is a feature that allows the slideshow to automatically restart from the beginning once it reaches the end. This setting can be enabled or disabled in the slideshow configuration. When enabled, the slideshow will continuously play until manually stopped by the user. This functionality is useful for situations where continuous playback is desired, such as digital signage or presentations in a loop.


### Autoplay

Autoplay enables the slideshow to begin playing automatically upon launch. When enabled, the slideshow will start playing without user intervention. This option is typically found in the slideshow configuration settings and can be toggled on or off.  This feature enhances usability by starting the slideshow immediately, eliminating the need for a manual play command.


### Slideshow Duration

The overall duration of the slideshow can be estimated based on the number of images, the duration of each image display, and the transition speeds. A precise calculation of the duration can be displayed to the user before the slideshow starts. While users can adjust the duration of individual image displays, the overall duration is determined by the sum of these individual durations plus the transition times.


### Full-Screen Mode

Full-screen mode allows the slideshow to be displayed across the entire screen, maximizing the viewing experience.  Activating full-screen mode hides all application controls and maximizes the image display area. This mode provides an immersive viewing experience without distractions from the application's interface. Full-screen mode is typically toggled on or off using a dedicated button or menu option.


### Customizing Navigation Controls

While basic navigation controls (play/pause, previous/next) are provided by default, some level of customization may be available. This could include options to:

* **Hide/Show Controls:** Users might be able to hide the controls entirely during playback for a cleaner, more immersive experience.
* **Customize Control Appearance:**  The visual style of the control buttons (size, color, shape) could be customizable to match the theme or branding of the slideshow.
* **Add Custom Controls:**  More advanced versions of the software might allow developers to add custom controls to extend functionality (e.g., a button to jump to a specific image).  The API for achieving this should be clearly documented.


## Advanced Features

### Adding Captions to Images

Camera Slideshow allows users to add captions or text overlays to individual images within the slideshow.  This feature enhances the presentation by providing additional context or information related to each image.  Captions can be added through a dedicated text input field associated with each image in the timeline.  Users can customize the text font, size, color, position, and style of the caption to match the overall aesthetic of the slideshow.  The application should provide tools for easy alignment and placement of captions on the image.

### Using External APIs for Image Sources

For advanced users, Camera Slideshow may offer integration with external APIs to fetch images from various online sources. This functionality opens up possibilities for dynamic slideshow creation, where images are sourced from external databases, image repositories, or social media platforms.  The application will need to provide a mechanism for specifying API endpoints, authentication credentials, and data parsing parameters.  Error handling and robust security measures are crucial for this feature to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity. Clear documentation of supported API types and data formats is essential.


### Integrating with Other JavaScript Libraries

If Camera Slideshow is a web-based application, developers may want to integrate it with other JavaScript libraries to enhance functionality or customize the user interface.  This could involve integrating with charting libraries to display data visualizations alongside images, using UI frameworks for a more polished design, or adding interactive elements using game development libraries.  The application's architecture should be designed to facilitate smooth integration with third-party libraries, with well-defined APIs and event handling mechanisms.  Documentation on supported libraries and integration methods is necessary.

### Custom Themes and Styling

To allow for greater flexibility and customization, Camera Slideshow may offer the ability to apply custom themes or styling. This involves creating and applying custom CSS stylesheets to modify the application's visual appearance.  Users can change colors, fonts, button styles, and other visual elements to match their preferences or branding guidelines.  A theme management system within the application allows for easy switching between pre-defined themes or loading user-created themes.  The application must provide clear guidelines on how to create and use custom themes, including the file structure, naming conventions, and supported CSS properties.

### Event Handling and Callbacks

For developers to extend the application's functionality, Camera Slideshow should provide a robust event handling system with callbacks.  These callbacks can be triggered at various points during the slideshow's lifecycle, such as when an image is loaded, a transition starts or ends, a user interacts with the controls, or an error occurs.  The application should provide documentation detailing the available events and how to register callbacks to handle them.  This allows developers to perform custom actions in response to specific events, creating more dynamic and interactive slideshows.  Examples of events could include `onImageLoad`, `onTransitionStart`, `onTransitionEnd`, `onPlay`, `onPause`, `onError`.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

This section lists common errors encountered when using Camera Slideshow, along with their likely causes and solutions.

* **Error: "Failed to load image"**: This error usually indicates that the application cannot access the specified image file or URL.  Check the file path or URL for typos. Ensure the file exists and has the correct permissions.  Verify that the network connection is stable if loading from a URL.
* **Error: "Unsupported image format"**:  Camera Slideshow only supports a specific set of image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP). If an unsupported format is used, this error will appear. Convert the image to a supported format before adding it to the slideshow.
* **Error: "Insufficient memory"**:  This error occurs if the system lacks sufficient RAM to handle the slideshow's demands, especially with high-resolution images or large slideshows. Close unnecessary applications, upgrade RAM, or reduce image resolution.
* **Error: "Export failed"**:  This error might occur due to problems with the output directory, insufficient disk space, or encoding issues. Check that you have enough free disk space, the export directory is accessible, and the selected output format is supported.
* **Error: "API request failed"**: If using external APIs, ensure that the API key is valid, the API endpoint is correct, and the network connection is stable. Check the API documentation for error codes.


### Debugging Tips

* **Check Console Logs:**  Use your browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing F12) to examine error messages and warnings.  These logs often provide valuable clues about the cause of problems.
* **Simplify the Slideshow:**  If you encounter unexpected behavior, try creating a minimal slideshow with only a few images and basic settings. This helps isolate the problem.
* **Test Individually:** If using external APIs or libraries, test each component individually to identify which part is causing the issue.
* **Use a Debugger:**  Utilize a JavaScript debugger (like the one built into your browser's developer tools) to step through the code and identify the source of errors.


### Performance Issues

* **Large Images:** High-resolution images can significantly impact performance. Consider using lower-resolution images or optimizing image sizes to improve loading times and playback smoothness.
* **Complex Transitions:**  Intricate or resource-intensive transitions can also reduce performance. Opt for simpler transitions if necessary.
* **Background Processes:**  Other applications running concurrently might consume system resources, affecting Camera Slideshow's performance. Close unnecessary applications before using Camera Slideshow.
