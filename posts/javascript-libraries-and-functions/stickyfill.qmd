## Introduction

### What is Stickyfill?

Stickyfill is a small, lightweight JavaScript polyfill that provides support for the CSS `position: sticky` property in browsers that don't natively support it.  It emulates the behavior of `position: sticky` using JavaScript, allowing you to use this powerful CSS feature across a wider range of browsers without needing to rely on complex workarounds or conditional CSS.  It aims to provide a consistent experience, closely mirroring the native implementation whenever possible.

### Why use Stickyfill?

`position: sticky` is a valuable CSS property that allows elements to be positioned relative to their parent container until they reach a specified scroll offset, after which they become fixed relative to the viewport. This is particularly useful for creating headers, sidebars, or other elements that need to remain visible as the user scrolls, without the limitations of purely fixed positioning.

Using Stickyfill allows you to leverage this functionality without sacrificing browser compatibility.  Instead of writing complex JavaScript or relying on less elegant CSS hacks, you can use the standard `position: sticky` declaration and let Stickyfill handle the cross-browser differences for you. This simplifies your code, improves maintainability, and ensures a consistent user experience.

### Browser Compatibility

Stickyfill aims to provide support for `position: sticky` in browsers that lack native support.  While modern browsers increasingly have built-in support, older browsers or those with specific configurations might still require Stickyfill.  You should always test your implementation thoroughly across your target browsers.  Refer to the latest compatibility matrix on the project's website or repository for up-to-date information on which browsers are fully supported.

### Installation

Stickyfill can be installed in several ways:

* **Using a CDN:** Include the Stickyfill script directly from a CDN like jsDelivr or unpkg in your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stickyfill@latest/dist/stickyfill.min.js"></script>
```

* **Using npm or yarn:** If you're using a package manager like npm or yarn, you can install Stickyfill as a dependency:

```bash
npm install stickyfill
# or
yarn add stickyfill
```

Then, you'll need to import and initialize it in your JavaScript code (e.g., within your main application script or a dedicated initialization file):

```javascript
import Stickyfill from 'stickyfill';
Stickyfill.add(); // This initializes Stickyfill
```

After installation, ensure that you have included the correct CSS for your sticky elements using the `position: sticky` property. Stickyfill will then handle the necessary JavaScript to make it work across browsers. Remember to check the project's documentation for any potential updates or changes to the initialization process.


## Basic Usage

### Applying Stickyfill to an element

Stickyfill works by automatically detecting elements with the `position: sticky` CSS property.  You don't need to explicitly tell Stickyfill which elements to apply to; it handles this automatically upon initialization.  Simply ensure that the elements you want to have sticky behavior have the correct CSS applied:

```css
.sticky-element {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0; /* Or other appropriate offset */
  background-color: #fff; /* Example styling */
  padding: 10px;
}
```

Once you've initialized Stickyfill (as described in the Installation section), it will automatically detect and process all elements with `position: sticky`.

### Basic options and attributes

While Stickyfill generally requires no additional configuration beyond initialization (`Stickyfill.add()`), it does offer a few options for more advanced use cases:

* **`Stickyfill.add(options)`:**  The `add()` method accepts an optional object of options. Currently,  no specific options are actively supported by the core Stickyfill library.  Future versions might include options for fine-tuning the behavior, such as specifying a specific container element, but as of now, `Stickyfill.add()` without arguments is sufficient for most use cases.

* **CSS Properties:** The behavior of the sticky element is primarily controlled through standard CSS properties like `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `offset`.  Manipulating these values will directly affect how the sticky element behaves.


### Example: Simple Sticky Element

Let's create a simple example of a sticky header:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Stickyfill Example</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stickyfill@latest/dist/stickyfill.min.js"></script>  
  <style>
    body {
      height: 2000px; /* Make the page long enough to scroll */
    }
    .sticky-header {
      position: sticky;
      top: 0;
      background-color: lightblue;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <div class="sticky-header">This is my sticky header!</div>

  <p>Scroll down to see the sticky header in action.</p>
  <p>More content to scroll through...</p>
  <!-- Add more content here -->

  <script>
    Stickyfill.add();
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a simple header with the class "sticky-header". The CSS sets it to `position: sticky` and `top: 0`, ensuring it sticks to the top of the viewport when scrolled. The JavaScript initializes Stickyfill, enabling the sticky behavior in browsers that don't support it natively.  Remember to replace `"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stickyfill@latest/dist/stickyfill.min.js"` with the correct path if you're not using a CDN.


## Advanced Usage

### Using the `stickyfill` function

While `Stickyfill.add()` is the recommended and simplest way to initialize Stickyfill, you can also use the `stickyfill` function directly for more granular control, though this is generally unnecessary for most applications.  This function allows you to apply Stickyfill to a specific element or set of elements instead of automatically applying it to all elements with `position: sticky`.  This function is primarily useful in situations where you need more precise control over when and how Stickyfill is applied.


```javascript
import Stickyfill from 'stickyfill';

const myElement = document.getElementById('my-sticky-element');
Stickyfill.stickyfill(myElement); // Applies Stickyfill to only 'my-sticky-element'
```


Remember that even when using `stickyfill` directly, the element still needs the `position: sticky` style applied via CSS.


### Customizing Sticky Behavior

Stickyfill primarily relies on standard CSS properties to customize the sticky behavior.  You can control the positioning, offset, and other aspects of the sticky element through CSS properties like `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `z-index`, etc.  No direct options within Stickyfill are available to alter the core sticky behavior; the CSS properties dictate how the element behaves once the Stickyfill polyfill is active.

For example, to make a sticky element stick to the bottom of its container:

```css
.sticky-element {
  position: sticky;
  bottom: 0;
  /* ...other styles... */
}
```

### Handling different scenarios (overflow, complex layouts)

Stickyfill generally works well with different layouts and overflow scenarios. However, complex layouts or situations with nested scrollable elements might require careful consideration of CSS and potentially additional custom JavaScript to ensure correct behavior.  Stickyfill primarily focuses on emulating the native `position: sticky` behavior; unusual layout quirks are handled by the browser's rendering engine, just as they would be with native `position: sticky` support.  Thorough testing in your specific environment is crucial.

If encountering unexpected behavior in complex layouts, carefully review your CSS, ensure that your selectors are correct, and consider using developer tools to inspect the element's positioning and layout within the browser.

### Working with JavaScript frameworks

Stickyfill is designed to be compatible with most JavaScript frameworks.  You can integrate it into your React, Angular, Vue, or other framework projects by following the standard installation instructions and calling `Stickyfill.add()` (or `stickyfill()`) after the DOM is fully rendered (or within a suitable lifecycle method).   For example, in React, you could initialize Stickyfill within a `useEffect` hook:


```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import Stickyfill from 'stickyfill';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    Stickyfill.add();
  }, []); // Run only once after mount

  return (
    // ... your JSX ...
  );
}
```


### Troubleshooting common issues

* **Sticky element doesn't stick:** Ensure that the element has `position: sticky` in your CSS, and that there is sufficient space within the parent container for the element to become fixed.  Also, verify that Stickyfill is correctly initialized and that there are no CSS conflicts affecting its behavior.  Check the browser's developer tools (like the Elements Inspector) to see if the element is being rendered with the correct computed styles.

* **Incorrect positioning:** Double-check your CSS values (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`), particularly making sure they are appropriate for your layout and desired behavior.  Inspect the element in your browser's developer tools to verify that the values are being applied correctly.

* **Conflicts with other JavaScript libraries:**  If you are using other libraries that manipulate the DOM or affect scrolling behavior, it's possible that they might conflict with Stickyfill.  Try disabling other libraries temporarily to see if this resolves the issue.

* **Performance issues:**  Stickyfill is generally very efficient, but in scenarios with a very large number of sticky elements, performance might be affected.  Consider optimizing your CSS and layout to minimize the number of elements requiring Stickyfill.

If you are still encountering issues, check the project's issue tracker or community forums for potential solutions or to report a bug.  Providing a minimal reproducible example is often helpful for debugging.


## Options and Attributes

### Detailed explanation of all options

Currently, Stickyfill does *not* offer any configurable options beyond the basic initialization using `Stickyfill.add()`.  The library's primary functionality relies on the standard CSS properties associated with the `position: sticky` declaration (namely `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`). All behavior is derived from these CSS rules, allowing for a simple and lightweight implementation.  Future versions might introduce additional options for fine-grained control, but as of now, the behavior is determined solely by CSS.

### Default values and their implications

Because there are no configurable options in Stickyfill, there are no default values to discuss. The behavior is entirely governed by the CSS applied to elements with `position: sticky`.  The implication is that Stickyfill does not impose any defaults or override any styles beyond what's necessary to emulate the native `position: sticky` functionality across different browsers.


### Example: Advanced customization using options.

Since there are no options to customize Stickyfill's core behavior, "advanced customization" is entirely achieved through CSS.  The following example demonstrates how CSS controls various aspects of the sticky behavior:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Stickyfill Advanced CSS Customization</title>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stickyfill@latest/dist/stickyfill.min.js"></script>
<style>
  .container {
    height: 2000px; /* Scrollable container */
    overflow-y: auto;
  }

  .sticky-element {
    position: sticky;
    top: 20px; /* Offset from top */
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 10px;
    z-index: 1000; /* Ensure it's on top */
    width: 300px; /* Set width for demonstration */
  }

  .sticky-element.bottom-sticky { /* Example of a bottom sticky element */
    top: auto;
    bottom: 20px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
  <div class="sticky-element">This element sticks to the top.</div>
  <div style="height: 1000px;">Lots of Scrollable Content</div>
  <div class="sticky-element bottom-sticky">This element sticks to the bottom.</div>

</div>
<script>
  Stickyfill.add();
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code showcases different sticky behaviors controlled purely through CSS. The `top` and `bottom` properties determine the sticky point, `z-index` handles layering, and width is adjusted for visual clarity.  All the advanced customization demonstrated here is done through CSS and not any options within the Stickyfill library itself.


## API Reference

### `stickyfill()` function details

The `stickyfill()` function provides a way to apply Stickyfill to specific elements.  It's an alternative to `Stickyfill.add()`, which applies Stickyfill to all elements with `position: sticky` on the page. The `stickyfill()` function is less commonly used but provides more granular control.


**Syntax:**

```javascript
Stickyfill.stickyfill(element[, options]);
```

* **`element`:**  A DOM element (or a NodeList/array of elements) to which Stickyfill should be applied.  If it's a NodeList or array, Stickyfill will be applied to each element in the collection.  The element(s) must already have the `position: sticky` style applied via CSS.

* **`options`:** (Currently not used).  This parameter is currently reserved for future expansion and has no effect in the current version.


**Example:**

```javascript
import Stickyfill from 'stickyfill';

const myStickyElement = document.querySelector('.my-sticky-element');
Stickyfill.stickyfill(myStickyElement); // Applies Stickyfill to a single element

const allStickyElements = document.querySelectorAll('.sticky');
Stickyfill.stickyfill(allStickyElements); // Applies Stickyfill to a NodeList of elements
```

### Event handling and callbacks

Stickyfill itself does not provide any custom events or callbacks. The behavior is entirely driven by the browser's rendering engine and the standard CSS `position: sticky` behavior.  If you need to detect when a sticky element changes its position (e.g., from relative to fixed), you'd have to use browser-provided methods to monitor changes in the element's position or bounding rectangle.  This might involve using `Intersection Observer API` or checking the element's `offsetTop` or `getBoundingClientRect()` properties periodically.


### Methods and properties

Stickyfill has only one public method:

* **`Stickyfill.add([options])`:** Initializes Stickyfill. Applies the polyfill to all elements on the page with `position: sticky` style. The optional `options` parameter is currently unused but reserved for future features.

* **`Stickyfill.stickyfill(element[, options])`:** Applies Stickyfill to a specific element or collection of elements. The `options` parameter is currently unused.

Stickyfill does not expose any public properties.  All its functionality is accessed through the above methods.  The internal workings of the library are not accessible directly.
