It's designed to be fast and efficient, focusing on compiling templates into JavaScript functions for optimal performance.  This means rendering happens entirely within the browser, without requiring server-side processing of templates. Hogan.js uses a syntax similar to Mustache, making it familiar to developers already comfortable with that templating language.  It's particularly well-suited for applications that require high-performance template rendering, especially on mobile or less powerful devices.\n\n\n### Why use Hogan.js?\n\nHogan.js offers several compelling reasons for its use:\n\n* **Speed and Efficiency:** Its compiled nature results in significantly faster rendering compared to many other templating engines that rely on string manipulation during rendering. This leads to a better user experience, especially with large datasets or complex templates.\n\n* **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** Its Mustache-inspired syntax is straightforward and easy to learn, minimizing the learning curve for developers.  Templates are readable and maintainable.\n\n* **Client-Side Rendering:**  All template processing happens in the browser, reducing server load and improving responsiveness.  This is beneficial for applications prioritizing low latency and reduced server-side resource consumption.\n\n* **Small Footprint:** Hogan.js is a small library, resulting in a minimal impact on the size of your application. This is crucial for optimizing page load times.\n\n* **Extensive Community Support:** While not as large as some other templating engines, Hogan.js benefits from a supportive community and readily available resources.\n\n\n### Key Features and Benefits\n\n* **Mustache-compatible syntax:**  Leverages the familiar and widely-adopted Mustache syntax, offering easy adoption and readability.\n* **Compiled templates:**  Templates are pre-compiled into optimized JavaScript functions for maximum rendering speed.\n* **No external dependencies:** Hogan.js works independently without requiring other libraries.\n* **Data-driven rendering:**  Templates are seamlessly integrated with your application's data structures.\n* **Error Handling:**  Provides helpful error messages to aid debugging.\n* **Extensibility (to a degree):** While primarily focused on the core Mustache syntax, Hogan allows for some level of customization through helper functions.\n\n\n### Comparison with other templating engines\n\nCompared to other JavaScript templating engines like Handlebars,  Mustache.js, and Underscore.js templates, Hogan.js often stands out due to its speed and small size.  While Handlebars offers more advanced features (e.g., helpers and partials), it may be slower. Mustache.js shares the same syntax but might lack some performance optimizations found in Hogan.js.  Underscore.js templates, while versatile, are generally not as specialized or performant for templating as Hogan.js. The choice ultimately depends on the specific needs of the project; if raw speed and minimal size are paramount, Hogan.js is a strong contender.\n\n\n### Setting up the Development Environment\n\nSetting up Hogan.js is straightforward.  You can include it in your project via:\n\n1. **CDN:** Include the Hogan.js library from a CDN like jsDelivr:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hogan.js@latest\"></script>\n   ```\n\n2. **NPM (Node Package Manager):** If you're using Node.js and npm, install it via:\n   ```bash\n   npm install hogan.js\n   ```\n   Then, require it in your JavaScript code using:\n   ```javascript\n   const Hogan = require('hogan.js');\n   ```\n\n3. **Download:** Download the Hogan.js library directly from the project repository and include it in your project.\n\nAfter including Hogan.js, you're ready to start compiling and rendering templates.  Refer to the Hogan.js documentation for detailed instructions on template syntax and API usage.\n\n\n## Basic Usage and Syntax\n\n### Creating a Simple Template\n\nThe simplest Hogan.js template consists of plain text interspersed with Mustache tags.  These tags are denoted by double curly braces `{{ }}`.  Anything outside these tags is rendered literally.  Let's create a template that displays a greeting:\n\n```html\n<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>\n```\n\nTo render this template, you'll first need to compile it using Hogan.js:\n\n```javascript\nconst Hogan = require('hogan.js'); // Or include via CDN as shown previously\n\nconst template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\nconst output = template.render({ name: 'World' });\nconsole.log(output); // Output: <p>Hello, World!</p>\n```\nThis code first compiles the template string into a rendering function. Then, it renders the template with a data object containing the `name` variable.\n\n\n### Using Variables in Templates\n\nYou can access variables from your data object within the template using Mustache syntax.  For example:\n\n```html\n<h1>{{title}}</h1>\n<p>{{description}}</p>\n<p>Price: ${{price}}</p>\n```\n\nGiven the data:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = {\n  title: \"My Awesome Product\",\n  description: \"This is a great product!\",\n  price: 99.99\n};\n```\n\nThe rendered output would correctly incorporate these values.\n\n\n### Escaping HTML\n\nHogan.js automatically escapes HTML entities within variables to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  If you need to render unescaped HTML, you can use the triple-mustache syntax `{{{ }}}`:\n\n```html\n<div>\n  Escaped: {{unsafeData}}\n  <br>\n  Unescaped: {{{unsafeData}}}\n</div>\n```\n\nIf `unsafeData` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the first instance will be escaped, while the second will render the script, potentially causing an XSS attack.  Use the triple-mustache with extreme caution and only when you are absolutely certain the data is safe.\n\n\n### Conditional Statements (if/else)\n\nHogan.js supports conditional rendering using sections.  A section starts with `{{#condition}}` and ends with `{{/condition}}`.  An `{{^condition}}` section is rendered only if the condition is falsy.\n\n```html\n{{#showName}}\n  <p>My name is {{name}}.</p>\n{{/showName}}\n{{^showName}}\n  <p>Name is hidden.</p>\n{{/showName}}\n```\n\nThis will show \"My name is...\" only if `showName` is truthy in the data object.\n\n\n### Iteration (loops)\n\nTo iterate over arrays or objects, use sections with the array or object as the context.\n\n```html\n{{#items}}\n  <li>{{name}}</li>\n{{/items}}\n```\n\nWhere `items` is an array of objects, each with a `name` property.  This will render a list item for each item in the array.\n\n\n### Partials\n\nPartials allow you to reuse sections of your templates.  While Hogan.js doesn't have built-in partial support in the same way as Handlebars, you can achieve a similar effect by creating functions or using a pre-processing step to include external templates before compiling.\n\n\n### Including External Templates\n\nTo include external templates, you'll need to load the template content (e.g., using AJAX) and then compile it using Hogan.js.  You can then combine it with your main template or render it separately.  There's no direct \"include\" directive in Hogan.js's core syntax; it's a matter of handling the external template loading and integration in your application's logic.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nfetch('my-external-template.html')\n  .then(response => response.text())\n  .then(templateText => {\n    const externalTemplate = Hogan.compile(templateText);\n    const externalData = { ... };\n    const renderedExternal = externalTemplate.render(externalData);\n    // ... integrate renderedExternal into your main template ...\n  });\n\n```\n\nRemember to adjust this example to your specific fetching method and error handling.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Working with Data Structures\n\nHogan.js handles various data structures effectively.  You can seamlessly access properties from objects, iterate over arrays, and even traverse nested objects using dot notation.  For instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = {\n  user: {\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    address: {\n      street: \"123 Main St\",\n      city: \"Anytown\"\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nconst template = Hogan.compile(\"User: {{user.name}}, City: {{user.address.city}}\");\nconst output = template.render(data);\nconsole.log(output); // Output: User: John Doe, City: Anytown\n```\n\nHandling complex data structures requires understanding how Hogan.js resolves context.  Remember that nested objects require proper dot notation within the template.\n\n\n### Custom Helpers and Functions\n\nWhile Hogan.js doesn't have a built-in helper system like Handlebars, you can create custom functions to extend its capabilities.  These functions can be passed into the `render` function as part of the data context:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction formatDate(dateString) {\n  // Your date formatting logic here\n  return new Date(dateString).toLocaleDateString();\n}\n\nconst data = {\n  date: \"2024-03-08\",\n  formatDate: formatDate\n};\n\nconst template = Hogan.compile(\"Today's date: {{formatDate(date)}}\");\nconst output = template.render(data);\nconsole.log(output); // Output will be the formatted date\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to define a `formatDate` helper and call it from within the template.  The helper function itself is included in the data object.\n\n\n### Context Management\n\nUnderstanding context is crucial for complex templates.  The context refers to the current data object being used for rendering.  Sections (`{{#section}}...{{/section}}`) create new contexts. When rendering nested sections, the inner section inherits the context from the outer section unless overridden.  Careful structuring of your data and mindful use of sections are key to managing context effectively.  If you need to explicitly change context, you may consider restructuring your data object or employing custom helpers.\n\n\n### Nested Partials\n\nHogan.js doesn't directly support nested partials in the same way as other templating engines.  To simulate nested partials, you need to load and render separate templates and integrate their output within your main template. This typically involves managing context carefully to pass data to the nested \"partials.\"  A pre-processing step to assemble larger templates from smaller components can also streamline the process.\n\n\n### Template Inheritance\n\nTemplate inheritance, in the sense of extending one template from another, isn't a built-in feature of Hogan.js.  Techniques like partial inclusion (as discussed earlier) combined with careful data management can approximate this behavior to some extent but will require more manual effort.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Debugging\n\nHogan.js provides some basic error handling.  If there are issues with the template syntax or accessing data, you'll usually see JavaScript errors in the browser console.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect these errors.  Carefully review your template syntax, data structure, and the calls to `Hogan.compile` and `.render` to diagnose the root cause.  Using a linter can help catch potential template errors early in the development process.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nHogan.js is already known for its performance. However, you can further optimize your templates for speed:\n\n* **Minimize template complexity:** Avoid deeply nested structures or excessively large templates. Break complex templates into smaller, reusable partials (or functionally equivalent components).\n* **Use efficient data structures:** Well-structured data simplifies rendering and minimizes the need for extensive processing.  Avoid unnecessary object lookups.\n* **Pre-compile templates:** Compile your templates once and reuse the compiled function repeatedly to avoid redundant compilation overhead.\n* **Minimize unnecessary rendering:** Only render the parts of the template that need updating when changes occur in the data.  Use techniques like virtual DOMs or diffing algorithms for efficient updates.\n\n\n\n\n## Integration with Frameworks\n\n### Hogan.js with React\n\nIntegrating Hogan.js with React involves using it to render HTML strings within React components.  Because React manages its own rendering process, you'll typically use Hogan.js to generate the HTML that React then inserts into the DOM.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport Hogan from 'hogan.js';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState({ name: 'World' });\n  const template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Using Hogan.js within React</p>\n      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: template.render(data) }} />\n      {/* Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with caution! */}\n      <button onClick={() => setData({ name: 'React' })}>\n        Change Name\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop should be used with extreme caution.  Always ensure the data used to render the Hogan.js template is properly sanitized to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Consider alternative approaches if possible that avoid direct innerHTML manipulation.\n\n\n### Hogan.js with Angular\n\nIn Angular, you can integrate Hogan.js within components by compiling the templates and injecting the rendered HTML.   This often involves creating a custom pipe or service to encapsulate the Hogan.js functionality.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport * as Hogan from 'hogan.js';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-my-component',\n  template: `\n    <p>Using Hogan.js within Angular</p>\n    <div [innerHTML]=\"renderedHtml\"></div>\n  `\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n  renderedHtml: string = '';\n\n  constructor() {\n    const template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\n    this.renderedHtml = template.render({ name: 'Angular' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to React, be mindful of security implications when using `innerHTML`.  Sanitize your data thoroughly.  A more robust approach might involve creating a custom Angular pipe to handle the template rendering and data sanitization in a cleaner, more Angular-idiomatic way.\n\n\n### Hogan.js with Vue.js\n\nIn Vue.js, you can leverage Hogan.js within a component's `template` or by creating a custom directive.  The approach using a custom directive offers better encapsulation and maintainability.  This example uses the template option:\n\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p>Using Hogan.js within Vue.js</p>\n    <div v-html=\"renderedHtml\"></div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport Hogan from 'hogan.js';\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      renderedHtml: ''\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    const template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\n    this.renderedHtml = template.render({ name: 'Vue.js' });\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nAgain,  `v-html` requires careful attention to data sanitization to prevent XSS.  A custom directive could provide a more structured way to manage this process and improve code organization.\n\n\n### Hogan.js with other frameworks\n\nThe integration patterns illustrated above for React, Angular, and Vue.js generally apply to other JavaScript frameworks.  The core idea is to use Hogan.js to pre-render the HTML and then inject it into the framework's DOM using appropriate mechanisms (e.g., `innerHTML`, dedicated methods for updating content within the framework's virtual DOM).  Always prioritize security and use data sanitization techniques to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Consider creating custom functions or components to encapsulate Hogan.js usage and improve code organization and maintainability within your chosen framework.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Hogan.compile()\n\nThe `Hogan.compile()` method compiles a Hogan.js template string into a reusable template function.  This function can then be used repeatedly to render the template with different data.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nconst templateFunction = Hogan.compile(templateString, [options]);\n```\n\n* **`templateString`:** (String) The Hogan.js template string to compile.\n* **`options`:** (Object, optional)  An object containing optional compilation options.  These are less commonly used but might include things like a custom delimiters configuration in advanced scenarios.  Consult the Hogan.js source or a comprehensive example for details on these options.\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nA template function that accepts a data object as an argument and returns the rendered HTML string.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst template = Hogan.compile('Hello, {{name}}!');\nconst output = template.render({ name: 'World' });\nconsole.log(output); // Output: Hello, World!\n```\n\n### Hogan.template()\n\nThe `Hogan.template()` method is a less frequently used alternative to `Hogan.compile()`. It's primarily a convenience method and mostly used internally.  It's generally recommended to use `Hogan.compile()` for most scenarios.  The functionality is very similar to `Hogan.compile()`.\n\n\n### Hogan.render()\n\nThis method is **deprecated** in newer versions of Hogan.js.  Instead of using `Hogan.render()`, you should compile the template using `Hogan.compile()` first and then call the `.render()` method on the resulting template function.\n\n### Template Methods\n\nOnce you've compiled a template using `Hogan.compile()`, the resulting function has the following key method:\n\n* **`.render(data, [options])`:** Renders the compiled template with the given data.\n\n    * **`data`:** (Object) The data object to use for rendering.  The template will use this data to populate its variables.\n    * **`options`:** (Object, optional) An object that might include options such as specifying custom helper functions, though this is less common with the core API.  The specific options are not extensively documented outside of example code and might not be consistently supported across versions.\n\n    **Return Value:**  A string containing the rendered HTML.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst template = Hogan.compile('My name is {{name}} and I am {{age}} years old.');\nconst output = template.render({ name: 'Alice', age: 30 });\nconsole.log(output); // Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n```\n\n\n### Helper Functions\n\nHogan.js doesn't have built-in helper functions in the same way as some other templating engines.  However, you can effectively create custom helper functions and pass them to the `.render()` method within the data object (as shown in the \"Advanced Techniques\" section). These helper functions extend the template's capabilities by providing reusable logic for tasks like formatting dates, numbers or performing conditional logic within the template.\n\n\n### Error Objects\n\nWhen errors occur during template compilation or rendering (e.g., syntax errors in the template or issues accessing data), Hogan.js will typically throw JavaScript errors. The specific error message will provide information about the nature of the problem.  These errors will generally appear in your browser's developer console (or through standard Node.js error handling if you're using Hogan.js in a server-side context). There isn't a specific, distinct \"Hogan.js Error Object\" class; standard JavaScript Error objects are used.\n\n\n## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nThe most critical security concern when using Hogan.js (or any templating engine) is **cross-site scripting (XSS)**.  Never directly insert unsanitized user-provided data into your templates using the double-mustache syntax `{{...}}`.  This can lead to vulnerabilities where malicious scripts are injected into your application.\n\n* **Always sanitize user input:** Before rendering any data from external sources (user input, databases, APIs), rigorously sanitize it to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.  While Hogan.js escapes HTML entities by default in `{{...}}`, this isn't a complete solution for all XSS vectors.  For more robust protection, consider using a dedicated library specifically designed for sanitizing HTML or employing a content security policy (CSP).\n\n* **Use triple-mustache cautiously:** The triple-mustache `{{{ }}}` syntax renders data without escaping.  Only use it if you are absolutely certain the data is safe and doesn't originate from untrusted sources.  If in doubt, *always* escape.\n\n* **Input validation:** Validate user input on the server-side *and* the client-side to prevent malicious data from even reaching your templates.\n\n* **Regular security audits:** Regularly review your templates and data handling processes for potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Template Design Best Practices\n\n* **Keep templates concise and focused:** Avoid creating overly complex templates.  Break down large templates into smaller, reusable components or partials to improve readability, maintainability, and testability.\n\n* **Use meaningful variable names:** Choose descriptive variable names that clearly indicate the data they represent. This improves template readability and reduces the likelihood of errors.\n\n* **Consistent indentation and formatting:**  Use consistent indentation and formatting to enhance readability.  Use a code formatter or linter to maintain consistency.\n\n* **Comment your templates:** Add comments to explain complex logic or the purpose of specific sections within your templates, especially if they are used in multiple places.\n\n* **Modular design:** Design your templates in a modular way so that you can easily reuse them in different parts of your application. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.\n\n* **Version control:** Use a version control system (like Git) to track changes to your templates and easily revert to previous versions if necessary.\n\n\n### Avoiding Common Mistakes\n\n* **Incorrect data structure:** Ensure the data object you provide to the `render` method matches the structure expected by the template. Mismatched structures lead to undefined variables and errors.\n\n* **Syntax errors:** Carefully check for syntax errors in your Hogan.js templates.  Typos and incorrect usage of Mustache tags are common sources of errors.  Use a linter to help catch these early.\n\n* **Context issues:** Be mindful of the context in which variables are accessed within nested sections.  Unexpected context changes can cause variables to resolve to unintended values.\n\n* **Forgetting to compile:**  Don't forget to compile your templates using `Hogan.compile()` before attempting to render them.  Rendering an uncompiled template string directly will not work.\n\n* **Unsanitized data:**  Always sanitize data before rendering to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n\n* **Check the browser's developer console:** Look for JavaScript errors that may indicate problems with your templates or data.\n\n* **Simplify your templates:**  If you're having trouble debugging a complex template, try simplifying it to isolate the source of the problem.\n\n* **Test with different data:**  Test your templates with various data sets to ensure they handle different scenarios correctly.\n\n* **Use a debugger:**  If you are using a development environment with debugging capabilities, use breakpoints to step through your code and inspect variables.\n\n* **Consult the documentation and community:** If you encounter issues not readily apparent, refer to the official Hogan.js documentation and community resources (e.g., Stack Overflow) for solutions and assistance.  Providing a minimal reproducible example (MRE) of the problem greatly helps when seeking help from the community.\n\n\n## Contributing to Hogan.js\n\n### Setting up the Development Environment\n\nContributing to Hogan.js typically involves working with its source code.  To set up your development environment:\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**  Start by forking the Hogan.js repository on GitHub and cloning your fork to your local machine:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <your-fork-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the cloned directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. **Run tests:**  Before making any changes, ensure the existing tests pass.

While Handlebars offers more advanced features (e.g., helpers and partials), it may be slower. Mustache.js shares the same syntax but might lack some performance optimizations found in Hogan.js.  Underscore.js templates, while versatile, are generally not as specialized or performant for templating as Hogan.js. The choice ultimately depends on the specific needs of the project; if raw speed and minimal size are paramount, Hogan.js is a strong contender.\n\n\n### Setting up the Development Environment\n\nSetting up Hogan.js is straightforward.  You can include it in your project via:\n\n1. **CDN:** Include the Hogan.js library from a CDN like jsDelivr:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hogan.js@latest\"></script>\n   ```\n\n2. **NPM (Node Package Manager):** If you're using Node.js and npm, install it via:\n   ```bash\n   npm install hogan.js\n   ```\n   Then, require it in your JavaScript code using:\n   ```javascript\n   const Hogan = require('hogan.js');\n   ```\n\n3. **Download:** Download the Hogan.js library directly from the project repository and include it in your project.\n\nAfter including Hogan.js, you're ready to start compiling and rendering templates.  Refer to the Hogan.js documentation for detailed instructions on template syntax and API usage.\n\n\n## Basic Usage and Syntax\n\n### Creating a Simple Template\n\nThe simplest Hogan.js template consists of plain text interspersed with Mustache tags.  These tags are denoted by double curly braces `{{ }}`.  Anything outside these tags is rendered literally.  Let's create a template that displays a greeting:\n\n```html\n<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>\n```\n\nTo render this template, you'll first need to compile it using Hogan.js:\n\n```javascript\nconst Hogan = require('hogan.js'); // Or include via CDN as shown previously\n\nconst template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\nconst output = template.render({ name: 'World' });\nconsole.log(output); // Output: <p>Hello, World!</p>\n```\nThis code first compiles the template string into a rendering function. Then, it renders the template with a data object containing the `name` variable.\n\n\n### Using Variables in Templates\n\nYou can access variables from your data object within the template using Mustache syntax.  For example:\n\n```html\n<h1>{{title}}</h1>\n<p>{{description}}</p>\n<p>Price: ${{price}}</p>\n```\n\nGiven the data:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = {\n  title: \"My Awesome Product\",\n  description: \"This is a great product!\",\n  price: 99.99\n};\n```\n\nThe rendered output would correctly incorporate these values.\n\n\n### Escaping HTML\n\nHogan.js automatically escapes HTML entities within variables to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  If you need to render unescaped HTML, you can use the triple-mustache syntax `{{{ }}}`:\n\n```html\n<div>\n  Escaped: {{unsafeData}}\n  <br>\n  Unescaped: {{{unsafeData}}}\n</div>\n```\n\nIf `unsafeData` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the first instance will be escaped, while the second will render the script, potentially causing an XSS attack.  Use the triple-mustache with extreme caution and only when you are absolutely certain the data is safe.\n\n\n### Conditional Statements (if/else)\n\nHogan.js supports conditional rendering using sections.  A section starts with `{{#condition}}` and ends with `{{/condition}}`.  An `{{^condition}}` section is rendered only if the condition is falsy.\n\n```html\n{{#showName}}\n  <p>My name is {{name}}.</p>\n{{/showName}}\n{{^showName}}\n  <p>Name is hidden.</p>\n{{/showName}}\n```\n\nThis will show \"My name is...\" only if `showName` is truthy in the data object.\n\n\n### Iteration (loops)\n\nTo iterate over arrays or objects, use sections with the array or object as the context.\n\n```html\n{{#items}}\n  <li>{{name}}</li>\n{{/items}}\n```\n\nWhere `items` is an array of objects, each with a `name` property.  This will render a list item for each item in the array.\n\n\n### Partials\n\nPartials allow you to reuse sections of your templates.  While Hogan.js doesn't have built-in partial support in the same way as Handlebars, you can achieve a similar effect by creating functions or using a pre-processing step to include external templates before compiling.\n\n\n### Including External Templates\n\nTo include external templates, you'll need to load the template content (e.g., using AJAX) and then compile it using Hogan.js.  You can then combine it with your main template or render it separately.  There's no direct \"include\" directive in Hogan.js's core syntax; it's a matter of handling the external template loading and integration in your application's logic.  For example:\n\n```javascript\nfetch('my-external-template.html')\n  .then(response => response.text())\n  .then(templateText => {\n    const externalTemplate = Hogan.compile(templateText);\n    const externalData = { ... };\n    const renderedExternal = externalTemplate.render(externalData);\n    // ... integrate renderedExternal into your main template ...\n  });\n\n```\n\nRemember to adjust this example to your specific fetching method and error handling.\n\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Working with Data Structures\n\nHogan.js handles various data structures effectively.  You can seamlessly access properties from objects, iterate over arrays, and even traverse nested objects using dot notation.  For instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = {\n  user: {\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    address: {\n      street: \"123 Main St\",\n      city: \"Anytown\"\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nconst template = Hogan.compile(\"User: {{user.name}}, City: {{user.address.city}}\");\nconst output = template.render(data);\nconsole.log(output); // Output: User: John Doe, City: Anytown\n```\n\nHandling complex data structures requires understanding how Hogan.js resolves context.  Remember that nested objects require proper dot notation within the template.\n\n\n### Custom Helpers and Functions\n\nWhile Hogan.js doesn't have a built-in helper system like Handlebars, you can create custom functions to extend its capabilities.  These functions can be passed into the `render` function as part of the data context:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction formatDate(dateString) {\n  // Your date formatting logic here\n  return new Date(dateString).toLocaleDateString();\n}\n\nconst data = {\n  date: \"2024-03-08\",\n  formatDate: formatDate\n};\n\nconst template = Hogan.compile(\"Today's date: {{formatDate(date)}}\");\nconst output = template.render(data);\nconsole.log(output); // Output will be the formatted date\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to define a `formatDate` helper and call it from within the template.  The helper function itself is included in the data object.\n\n\n### Context Management\n\nUnderstanding context is crucial for complex templates.  The context refers to the current data object being used for rendering.  Sections (`{{#section}}...{{/section}}`) create new contexts. When rendering nested sections, the inner section inherits the context from the outer section unless overridden.  Careful structuring of your data and mindful use of sections are key to managing context effectively.  If you need to explicitly change context, you may consider restructuring your data object or employing custom helpers.\n\n\n### Nested Partials\n\nHogan.js doesn't directly support nested partials in the same way as other templating engines.  To simulate nested partials, you need to load and render separate templates and integrate their output within your main template. This typically involves managing context carefully to pass data to the nested \"partials.\"  A pre-processing step to assemble larger templates from smaller components can also streamline the process.\n\n\n### Template Inheritance\n\nTemplate inheritance, in the sense of extending one template from another, isn't a built-in feature of Hogan.js.  Techniques like partial inclusion (as discussed earlier) combined with careful data management can approximate this behavior to some extent but will require more manual effort.\n\n\n### Error Handling and Debugging\n\nHogan.js provides some basic error handling.  If there are issues with the template syntax or accessing data, you'll usually see JavaScript errors in the browser console.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect these errors.  Carefully review your template syntax, data structure, and the calls to `Hogan.compile` and `.render` to diagnose the root cause.  Using a linter can help catch potential template errors early in the development process.\n\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nHogan.js is already known for its performance. However, you can further optimize your templates for speed:\n\n* **Minimize template complexity:** Avoid deeply nested structures or excessively large templates. Break complex templates into smaller, reusable partials (or functionally equivalent components).\n* **Use efficient data structures:** Well-structured data simplifies rendering and minimizes the need for extensive processing.  Avoid unnecessary object lookups.\n* **Pre-compile templates:** Compile your templates once and reuse the compiled function repeatedly to avoid redundant compilation overhead.\n* **Minimize unnecessary rendering:** Only render the parts of the template that need updating when changes occur in the data.  Use techniques like virtual DOMs or diffing algorithms for efficient updates.\n\n\n\n\n## Integration with Frameworks\n\n### Hogan.js with React\n\nIntegrating Hogan.js with React involves using it to render HTML strings within React components.  Because React manages its own rendering process, you'll typically use Hogan.js to generate the HTML that React then inserts into the DOM.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport Hogan from 'hogan.js';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState({ name: 'World' });\n  const template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Using Hogan.js within React</p>\n      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: template.render(data) }} />\n      {/* Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with caution! */}\n      <button onClick={() => setData({ name: 'React' })}>\n        Change Name\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n**Important Note:**  The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop should be used with extreme caution.  Always ensure the data used to render the Hogan.js template is properly sanitized to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Consider alternative approaches if possible that avoid direct innerHTML manipulation.\n\n\n### Hogan.js with Angular\n\nIn Angular, you can integrate Hogan.js within components by compiling the templates and injecting the rendered HTML.   This often involves creating a custom pipe or service to encapsulate the Hogan.js functionality.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport * as Hogan from 'hogan.js';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-my-component',\n  template: `\n    <p>Using Hogan.js within Angular</p>\n    <div [innerHTML]=\"renderedHtml\"></div>\n  `\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n  renderedHtml: string = '';\n\n  constructor() {\n    const template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\n    this.renderedHtml = template.render({ name: 'Angular' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to React, be mindful of security implications when using `innerHTML`.  Sanitize your data thoroughly.  A more robust approach might involve creating a custom Angular pipe to handle the template rendering and data sanitization in a cleaner, more Angular-idiomatic way.\n\n\n### Hogan.js with Vue.js\n\nIn Vue.js, you can leverage Hogan.js within a component's `template` or by creating a custom directive.  The approach using a custom directive offers better encapsulation and maintainability.  This example uses the template option:\n\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p>Using Hogan.js within Vue.js</p>\n    <div v-html=\"renderedHtml\"></div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport Hogan from 'hogan.js';\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      renderedHtml: ''\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    const template = Hogan.compile('<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>');\n    this.renderedHtml = template.render({ name: 'Vue.js' });\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nAgain,  `v-html` requires careful attention to data sanitization to prevent XSS.  A custom directive could provide a more structured way to manage this process and improve code organization.\n\n\n### Hogan.js with other frameworks\n\nThe integration patterns illustrated above for React, Angular, and Vue.js generally apply to other JavaScript frameworks.  The core idea is to use Hogan.js to pre-render the HTML and then inject it into the framework's DOM using appropriate mechanisms (e.g., `innerHTML`, dedicated methods for updating content within the framework's virtual DOM).  Always prioritize security and use data sanitization techniques to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Consider creating custom functions or components to encapsulate Hogan.js usage and improve code organization and maintainability within your chosen framework.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Hogan.compile()\n\nThe `Hogan.compile()` method compiles a Hogan.js template string into a reusable template function.  This function can then be used repeatedly to render the template with different data.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```javascript\nconst templateFunction = Hogan.compile(templateString, [options]);\n```\n\n* **`templateString`:** (String) The Hogan.js template string to compile.\n* **`options`:** (Object, optional)  An object containing optional compilation options.  These are less commonly used but might include things like a custom delimiters configuration in advanced scenarios.  Consult the Hogan.js source or a comprehensive example for details on these options.\n\n**Return Value:**\n\nA template function that accepts a data object as an argument and returns the rendered HTML string.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst template = Hogan.compile('Hello, {{name}}!');\nconst output = template.render({ name: 'World' });\nconsole.log(output); // Output: Hello, World!\n```\n\n### Hogan.template()\n\nThe `Hogan.template()` method is a less frequently used alternative to `Hogan.compile()`. It's primarily a convenience method and mostly used internally.  It's generally recommended to use `Hogan.compile()` for most scenarios.  The functionality is very similar to `Hogan.compile()`.\n\n\n### Hogan.render()\n\nThis method is **deprecated** in newer versions of Hogan.js.  Instead of using `Hogan.render()`, you should compile the template using `Hogan.compile()` first and then call the `.render()` method on the resulting template function.\n\n### Template Methods\n\nOnce you've compiled a template using `Hogan.compile()`, the resulting function has the following key method:\n\n* **`.render(data, [options])`:** Renders the compiled template with the given data.\n\n    * **`data`:** (Object) The data object to use for rendering.  The template will use this data to populate its variables.\n    * **`options`:** (Object, optional) An object that might include options such as specifying custom helper functions, though this is less common with the core API.  The specific options are not extensively documented outside of example code and might not be consistently supported across versions.\n\n    **Return Value:**  A string containing the rendered HTML.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\nconst template = Hogan.compile('My name is {{name}} and I am {{age}} years old.');\nconst output = template.render({ name: 'Alice', age: 30 });\nconsole.log(output); // Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n```\n\n\n### Helper Functions\n\nHogan.js doesn't have built-in helper functions in the same way as some other templating engines.  However, you can effectively create custom helper functions and pass them to the `.render()` method within the data object (as shown in the \"Advanced Techniques\" section). These helper functions extend the template's capabilities by providing reusable logic for tasks like formatting dates, numbers or performing conditional logic within the template.\n\n\n### Error Objects\n\nWhen errors occur during template compilation or rendering (e.g., syntax errors in the template or issues accessing data), Hogan.js will typically throw JavaScript errors. The specific error message will provide information about the nature of the problem.  These errors will generally appear in your browser's developer console (or through standard Node.js error handling if you're using Hogan.js in a server-side context). There isn't a specific, distinct \"Hogan.js Error Object\" class; standard JavaScript Error objects are used.\n\n\n## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nThe most critical security concern when using Hogan.js (or any templating engine) is **cross-site scripting (XSS)**.  Never directly insert unsanitized user-provided data into your templates using the double-mustache syntax `{{...}}`.  This can lead to vulnerabilities where malicious scripts are injected into your application.\n\n* **Always sanitize user input:** Before rendering any data from external sources (user input, databases, APIs), rigorously sanitize it to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.  While Hogan.js escapes HTML entities by default in `{{...}}`, this isn't a complete solution for all XSS vectors.  For more robust protection, consider using a dedicated library specifically designed for sanitizing HTML or employing a content security policy (CSP).\n\n* **Use triple-mustache cautiously:** The triple-mustache `{{{ }}}` syntax renders data without escaping.  Only use it if you are absolutely certain the data is safe and doesn't originate from untrusted sources.  If in doubt, *always* escape.\n\n* **Input validation:** Validate user input on the server-side *and* the client-side to prevent malicious data from even reaching your templates.\n\n* **Regular security audits:** Regularly review your templates and data handling processes for potential vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Template Design Best Practices\n\n* **Keep templates concise and focused:** Avoid creating overly complex templates.  Break down large templates into smaller, reusable components or partials to improve readability, maintainability, and testability.\n\n* **Use meaningful variable names:** Choose descriptive variable names that clearly indicate the data they represent. This improves template readability and reduces the likelihood of errors.\n\n* **Consistent indentation and formatting:**  Use consistent indentation and formatting to enhance readability.  Use a code formatter or linter to maintain consistency.\n\n* **Comment your templates:** Add comments to explain complex logic or the purpose of specific sections within your templates, especially if they are used in multiple places.\n\n* **Modular design:** Design your templates in a modular way so that you can easily reuse them in different parts of your application. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.\n\n* **Version control:** Use a version control system (like Git) to track changes to your templates and easily revert to previous versions if necessary.\n\n\n### Avoiding Common Mistakes\n\n* **Incorrect data structure:** Ensure the data object you provide to the `render` method matches the structure expected by the template. Mismatched structures lead to undefined variables and errors.\n\n* **Syntax errors:** Carefully check for syntax errors in your Hogan.js templates.  Typos and incorrect usage of Mustache tags are common sources of errors.  Use a linter to help catch these early.\n\n* **Context issues:** Be mindful of the context in which variables are accessed within nested sections.  Unexpected context changes can cause variables to resolve to unintended values.\n\n* **Forgetting to compile:**  Don't forget to compile your templates using `Hogan.compile()` before attempting to render them.  Rendering an uncompiled template string directly will not work.\n\n* **Unsanitized data:**  Always sanitize data before rendering to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n\n* **Check the browser's developer console:** Look for JavaScript errors that may indicate problems with your templates or data.\n\n* **Simplify your templates:**  If you're having trouble debugging a complex template, try simplifying it to isolate the source of the problem.\n\n* **Test with different data:**  Test your templates with various data sets to ensure they handle different scenarios correctly.\n\n* **Use a debugger:**  If you are using a development environment with debugging capabilities, use breakpoints to step through your code and inspect variables.\n\n* **Consult the documentation and community:** If you encounter issues not readily apparent, refer to the official Hogan.js documentation and community resources (e.g., Stack Overflow) for solutions and assistance.  Providing a minimal reproducible example (MRE) of the problem greatly helps when seeking help from the community.\n\n\n## Contributing to Hogan.js\n\n### Setting up the Development Environment\n\nContributing to Hogan.js typically involves working with its source code.  To set up your development environment:\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**  Start by forking the Hogan.js repository on GitHub and cloning your fork to your local machine:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <your-fork-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the cloned directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. **Run tests:**  Before making any changes, ensure the existing tests pass.  This provides a baseline and helps to prevent regressions.  The test command will vary depending on the project's setup. Check the project's `README` for specific instructions on running tests.  It might involve commands like:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm test\n   ```\n\n\n### Writing Tests\n\nHogan.js uses a testing framework (check the project's `README` or `package.json` for details, likely something like Mocha or Jest).  When contributing new features or fixing bugs, you should write comprehensive tests to ensure your changes work correctly and don't introduce regressions.  Tests should cover various scenarios, edge cases, and potential error conditions.  The project will have established a style for how tests are written; follow that style and add tests in the appropriate location within the test suite.\n\n### Submitting Pull Requests\n\n1. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b <your-branch-name>\n   ```\n\n2. **Make your changes:** Implement your changes, ensuring that your code adheres to the project's coding style guide (see below).\n\n3. **Run tests:** Run the tests again to ensure your changes haven't broken anything.\n\n4. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise messages:\n\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Your descriptive commit message\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push origin <your-branch-name>\n   ```\n\n6. **Create a pull request:** On GitHub, create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original Hogan.js repository.  Provide a detailed description of your changes, including the context, rationale, and any relevant information.  Address any feedback from reviewers.\n\n\n### Coding Style Guide\n\nAdhere to the coding style used consistently within the Hogan.js project.  This typically involves:\n\n* **Consistent indentation:**  Use consistent indentation (usually 2 or 4 spaces, not tabs).\n* **Meaningful variable and function names:** Use descriptive names that clearly communicate the purpose of variables and functions.\n* **Comments:** Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.  Keep comments up-to-date as the code evolves.\n* **Error handling:** Implement appropriate error handling to gracefully handle potential issues.\n* **Testing:** Write comprehensive tests to verify the correctness of your code.\n* **Code reviews:**  Be receptive to feedback during the code review process and make the necessary revisions.\n\n\nThe specific style guide details might be documented within the project (e.g., in a `.editorconfig` file, a `contributing.md` file, or within the project's `README`). Carefully review these style guides before submitting your pull request.  Consistency is key to maintainability and readability of the project's codebase.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"include-in-header":["../../favicon.html","../../header.html"],"include-after-body":[{"text":"<script
