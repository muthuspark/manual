## Introduction

### What is Clipboard.js?

Clipboard.js is a small, lightweight JavaScript library for copying text to the clipboard.  It provides a simple and cross-browser way to implement copy-to-clipboard functionality without requiring complex code or server-side assistance.  Instead of relying on Flash or other browser plugins, it utilizes the browser's native clipboard APIs (where available) for optimal performance and security.  Fallback mechanisms are implemented for browsers lacking direct clipboard support.

### Why use Clipboard.js?

Using Clipboard.js offers several advantages:

* **Simplicity:**  The API is incredibly straightforward, making integration into your projects easy and quick.
* **Cross-browser compatibility:** Clipboard.js handles the complexities of different browser implementations, providing a consistent experience across platforms.
* **Lightweight:** The library is small in size, minimizing the impact on your application's load time.
* **No server-side requirements:** All copying operations are handled client-side, eliminating the need for server interactions.
* **Security:**  Leveraging native clipboard APIs enhances security compared to workarounds.


### Browser Compatibility

Clipboard.js aims for broad browser compatibility. While it strives to support as many browsers as possible using fallback mechanisms, optimal functionality relies on modern browser features.  For the most reliable experience,  we recommend using current versions of the following:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Edge

Older browsers or those with disabled clipboard APIs may have limitations in functionality.  Specific compatibility details may vary based on the version of Clipboard.js and the user's browser configuration.


### Getting Started

To use Clipboard.js, first include the library in your project. You can download the minified version from [link to download - replace with actual link] or use a CDN like unpkg:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/clipboard@2/dist/clipboard.min.js"></script> </html>
```

Next, instantiate a new Clipboard object, targeting the element you want to attach the copy functionality to.  This element usually has a data attribute indicating the text to copy:

```javascript
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');
```

Here, `'.btn'` selects all elements with the class "btn".  Each of these elements should have a `data-clipboard-text` attribute specifying the text to be copied:

```html
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="Copy this text!">Copy</button>
```

Clipboard.js will automatically handle the copying process when the selected element is clicked.  You can optionally add event listeners for success or error callbacks:

```javascript
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
  success: function(e) {
    console.log(e.text); // The text that was copied
    console.log(e.trigger); // The element that was clicked
    alert("Text copied!");
  },
  error: function(e) {
    console.error('Action:', e.action);
    console.error('Trigger:', e.trigger);
    console.error('Message:', e.text);
    alert("Failed to copy!");
  }
});
```

Remember to remove the event listener if needed to prevent memory leaks:

```javascript
clipboard.destroy();
```


## Basic Usage

### Including Clipboard.js

There are several ways to include Clipboard.js in your project:

* **Download:** Download the minified JavaScript file (`clipboard.min.js`) from [link to download - replace with actual link] and include it in your HTML using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="path/to/clipboard.min.js"></script>
```
Replace `"path/to/clipboard.min.js"` with the actual path to the downloaded file.

* **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Use a CDN like unpkg to include the library:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/clipboard@2/dist/clipboard.min.js"></script>
```

This method is convenient as you don't need to manage the file yourself.  Ensure the CDN link is correct and that the version number (`@2` in this example) matches the documentation.


### Creating a Copy Button

Create a button element in your HTML. This button will trigger the copy action.  It's crucial to include the `data-clipboard-text` attribute, which specifies the text to be copied to the clipboard.  The text can be any valid string, including HTML entities if desired.

```html
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="This text will be copied!">Copy</button>
```


### Targeting Elements

Clipboard.js uses the CSS selector you provide to find the elements to attach the copy functionality to.  The selector can be a class (as above), an ID, or any valid CSS selector.  Multiple elements matching the selector will all have copy functionality applied.   Each element *must* have a `data-clipboard-text` attribute to define what text will be copied when it's clicked.  You can target multiple buttons with different content.  If a single element is matched, only that element will have the copy event listener applied.

```html
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="Text 1">Copy 1</button>
<button id="myButton" data-clipboard-text="Text 2">Copy 2</button>
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="Text 3">Copy 3</button>

```

### Basic Copy Example

This example combines the inclusion of Clipboard.js, the creation of a button, and the instantiation of the ClipboardJS object:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Clipboard.js Example</title>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/clipboard@2/dist/clipboard.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="Hello, world!">Copy Text</button>

<script>
  var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This code will create a button. When clicked, the text "Hello, world!" will be copied to the clipboard.  No additional JavaScript is needed for this basic functionality beyond the instantiation of `ClipboardJS`.  Remember to replace the CDN link with your local path if you downloaded the library.


## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Button Text

By default, Clipboard.js doesn't change the button's text.  To dynamically update button text after a copy action, use the success and error callbacks (described below) to modify the button's innerHTML or textContent.  For example:


```javascript
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
  success: function(e) {
    e.trigger.textContent = 'Copied!';
  },
  error: function(e) {
    e.trigger.textContent = 'Copy failed!';
  }
});
```

This code changes the button text to "Copied!" on success and "Copy failed!" on error.  Remember that directly manipulating the DOM within these callbacks ensures the changes reflect the copy action's outcome.

### Handling Success and Error

The `success` and `error` callback functions within the `ClipboardJS` options object allow you to handle the outcome of the copy operation.  The `success` callback receives an object with `text` (the copied text) and `trigger` (the clicked element) properties. The `error` callback provides information about the failure, including the `action` attempted, the `trigger` element, and an optional `text` message.


```javascript
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
  success: function(e) {
    console.log('Copied:', e.text); // Log the copied text to the console
    alert('Text copied to clipboard!'); //Show an alert message.
  },
  error: function(e) {
    console.error('Clipboard action failed:', e); // Log error details
    alert('Failed to copy text to clipboard!'); //Show an alert message
  }
});
```


### Text Selection

Clipboard.js copies the text specified in the `data-clipboard-text` attribute. It does *not* copy selected text from the page. If you want to copy selected text, you'll need to implement that functionality separately, possibly using the `window.getSelection()` method and setting the `data-clipboard-text` attribute dynamically based on the selected text.


### Copying HTML

While `data-clipboard-text` accepts HTML, it's typically interpreted as plain text. To copy HTML as formatted HTML (not rendered HTML), you'll need to escape special characters appropriately before assigning them to the `data-clipboard-text` attribute.  Consider using a library or function to properly escape HTML entities to prevent injection vulnerabilities.


### Asynchronous Copying

Clipboard.js primarily operates synchronously.  However,  if you need to perform actions *before* copying (like dynamically generating the text), you might need to incorporate asynchronous operations, ensuring the `data-clipboard-text` is updated *before* the user interacts with the button:


```javascript
//Simulate Async Data Retrieval
function getAsyncText() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("This is the async text!");
    }, 1000); // Simulate a delay
  });
}

getAsyncText().then((text) => {
  const btn = document.querySelector('.btn');
  btn.setAttribute('data-clipboard-text', text);
  new ClipboardJS('.btn');
})
```



### Multiple Copy Buttons

You can target multiple copy buttons by using a CSS selector that matches all of them.  Each button should have its own `data-clipboard-text` attribute specifying the text it should copy:


```html
<button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="Text 1">Copy 1</button>
<button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="Text 2">Copy 2</button>
<script>
  var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-button');
</script>
```

### Using with Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)

Clipboard.js is a plain JavaScript library, and it can be used in any JavaScript framework.  The integration approach depends on the framework.  Common methods include:

* **Direct inclusion:**  Include Clipboard.js as described in the basic usage section, and then instantiate it within the framework's lifecycle methods (like `componentDidMount` in React or a `mounted` hook in Vue).
* **Wrapper components:**  Create a custom component that wraps the button and handles the Clipboard.js instantiation and management. This approach improves code organization and reusability.
* **Integration with framework's event system:**  Handle clicks and updates using the framework's event system to trigger copying and update the UI.

Remember to handle potential lifecycle issues (like unmounting components) and to appropriately manage the Clipboard.js instance to avoid memory leaks, particularly in frameworks with component lifecycles.  Consult your framework's documentation for guidance on integrating external libraries.


## Options and Configuration

### The `clipboard` Object

The core of Clipboard.js functionality revolves around the `ClipboardJS` object.  You create an instance of this object, passing in options to customize its behavior.  The options are passed as a single object to the constructor:

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS(selector, options);
```

Where `selector` is a CSS selector string targeting the elements to which you'll attach copy functionality, and `options` is an object detailing the configuration.


### The `target` Option

The `target` option specifies the element whose content should be copied.  It is particularly useful when you want to copy text from an element other than the one that triggered the copy action (e.g., copying text from a hidden element when a button is clicked).   The value should be a CSS selector string targeting the element containing the text to be copied. If not provided, the text will be pulled from the `data-clipboard-text` attribute of the trigger element.

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-button', {
  target: '#hidden-text'
});
```

In this example, clicking an element with the class `copy-button` will copy the text content of the element with the ID `hidden-text`.


### The `text` Option

The `text` option provides a function that dynamically generates the text to be copied.  This function receives the trigger element as an argument and should return a string. This is especially useful when the text to copy depends on data not directly present in the HTML.

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-button', {
  text: function(trigger) {
    return trigger.dataset.customText || 'Default text';
  }
});
```

Here, the function checks for a `data-custom-text` attribute on the trigger element; if present, it uses that value; otherwise, it uses "Default text".


### The `action` Option

The `action` option is less frequently used but allows you to specify the copy action to perform.  The default is 'copy'. While other actions might be supported by browsers (like 'cut'), it's typically not necessary to explicitly set it.

```javascript
// Usually not needed, default is 'copy'
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-button', {
  action: 'copy'
});

```

### The `container` Option

The `container` option specifies a parent element within which to search for the target element if using the `target` option. If not specified, Clipboard.js searches the entire document. This is useful for optimizing performance when dealing with large documents.


```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-button', {
  target: '.target-element',
  container: '#my-container'
});
```

This limits the search for `.target-element` to only within the element having the ID `my-container`.


### The `trigger` Option

The `trigger` option allows you to manually set the element that should trigger the copy action. While the constructor’s first argument implicitly sets the trigger, this option provides explicit control. It's less commonly needed unless advanced scenarios require decoupling the trigger element from the target element beyond what `target` alone can achieve.


### The `debug` Option

The `debug` option enables verbose logging to the console for debugging purposes. Setting `debug` to `true` will output detailed information about the copy process, which can be helpful for troubleshooting issues.

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.copy-button', {
  debug: true
});
```

This will print useful information in your browser’s console for analysis during development. Remember to disable this option in production.


## Events and Callbacks

Clipboard.js provides two main events/callbacks that allow you to respond to the success or failure of a copy operation: `success` and `error`. These are configured within the options object passed to the `ClipboardJS` constructor.


### `success` Event

The `success` callback function is executed when the copy operation is successful. It receives a single argument: an object containing information about the successful copy action.

* **`e.text`**: A string containing the text that was copied to the clipboard.
* **`e.trigger`**: A DOM element reference to the element that triggered the copy action (the button or element that was clicked).  This allows you to directly manipulate the element (e.g., change its text content to indicate success).
* **`e.action`**: A string indicating the action performed ('copy').


### `error` Event

The `error` callback function is executed when the copy operation fails.  This can happen for various reasons, including browser limitations or user permissions. The event object passed to the callback contains:

* **`e.action`**: A string indicating the action that failed ('copy').
* **`e.trigger`**: A DOM element reference to the element that triggered the copy action.
* **`e.reason`**: (optional) A string providing more specific details about why the copy failed. This might indicate a permission issue or browser incompatibility.  The specific reasons may evolve with Clipboard.js updates and browser changes.
* **`e.text`**: The text that failed to copy.



### Event Handling Examples

Here are examples demonstrating how to use the `success` and `error` events:

**Example 1: Basic Success/Error Handling**

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
  success: function(e) {
    console.log('Copied text: ', e.text);
    alert('Text copied to clipboard!');
  },
  error: function(e) {
    console.error('Copy failed: ', e);
    alert('Failed to copy text. Please try again.');
  }
});

```

**Example 2: Updating Button Text**

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
  success: function(e) {
    e.trigger.textContent = 'Copied!';
  },
  error: function(e) {
    e.trigger.textContent = 'Copy failed!';
  }
});
```

This example modifies the button's text after a successful or failed copy attempt.


**Example 3:  More Detailed Error Handling**


```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
    success: function(e) {
      console.log('Copied:', e.text);
    },
    error: function(e) {
      console.error('Action:', e.action);
      console.error('Trigger:', e.trigger);
      if (e.reason) {
        console.error('Reason:', e.reason);
        alert(`Copy failed: ${e.reason}`);
      } else {
        console.error('An unknown error occurred.');
        alert('Copy failed. Please check your browser settings and try again.');
      }
    }
  });
```

This example provides more informative error messages to the user by checking for the `e.reason` property.  Remember that not all error conditions will necessarily populate the reason field.  Handle cases where `e.reason` is missing to prevent unexpected behavior.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Error:** "Failed to copy: Not allowed to access clipboard" or similar permission errors.

**Solution:** This usually indicates a browser security restriction.  Ensure that the website is served over HTTPS (HTTP is typically blocked for clipboard access).  Also, check browser settings related to clipboard access permissions.  The user may need to explicitly allow the website access to the clipboard. Some browser extensions may also interfere with clipboard access. Try disabling such extensions temporarily for testing purposes.


**Error:**  The copy action doesn't seem to work at all, no errors in the console.

**Solution:**

* **Check for typos:** Double-check your HTML and JavaScript for any typos in selectors, attribute names (`data-clipboard-text`), or function names.
* **Incorrect library inclusion:** Make sure you've correctly included the Clipboard.js library in your HTML file. Verify the path is accurate, and that there are no network errors preventing loading.
* **Selector issues:** Ensure your CSS selector correctly targets the button(s). Use your browser's developer tools to verify that the selector matches the intended elements.
* **Asynchronous operations:** If you are dynamically setting the `data-clipboard-text` attribute, ensure it's updated *before* the ClipboardJS instance is created.


**Error:**  `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trigger')` or similar errors related to `e.trigger` being undefined.


**Solution:** This error often arises if you access `e.trigger` outside the scope of the `success` or `error` callbacks.  These callbacks provide `e.trigger` only within their context. Ensure that you're only accessing `e.trigger` inside these handlers.


**Error:**  The copied text is incorrect or incomplete.

**Solution:** Verify the content of the `data-clipboard-text` attribute or the text returned from the `text` option function.  Ensure you are not accidentally copying HTML entities that are not properly escaped.


### Debugging Tips

* **Use the browser's developer tools:**  The console in your browser's developer tools is crucial for troubleshooting.  Enable the `debug` option in Clipboard.js for more verbose logging (`{debug: true}`).
* **Simplify your code:**  If you encounter complex issues, try isolating the problem by creating a minimal, reproducible example. This helps pinpoint the exact source of the error.
* **Check for conflicts:**  Other JavaScript libraries or scripts on your page could potentially interfere with Clipboard.js. Try temporarily disabling other scripts to see if it resolves the issue.
* **Check the Network Tab:** In your browser's developer tools, review the Network tab to ensure that Clipboard.js is successfully loaded without errors.

### Browser-Specific Issues

While Clipboard.js strives for cross-browser compatibility, minor inconsistencies can occur.  Here are some browser-specific considerations:

* **Older browsers:** Older browsers may lack native clipboard APIs, relying on fallbacks that might have limitations.  For optimal compatibility, aim for modern browsers (recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* **Permissions:**  Browsers may require explicit permission to access the clipboard. Always test your application under HTTPS.
* **Extensions:** Browser extensions might interfere with clipboard functionality.  Temporarily disable extensions to check for conflicts.
* **Specific browser bugs:**  Rarely, browser-specific bugs might affect Clipboard.js. Check the browser's bug tracking system or community forums for known issues.


If you encounter problems not addressed here, provide a minimal reproducible example, including your code and the browser details, when seeking support.  This greatly aids in diagnosing and resolving the issue.


## API Reference

Clipboard.js provides a few methods on the instantiated `clipboard` object for advanced control and management of the copy functionality.


### `clipboard.on(eventName, callback)`

This method adds an event listener to the Clipboard.js instance.  It allows you to listen for custom events beyond the built-in `success` and `error` callbacks.  While Clipboard.js doesn't trigger many custom events directly, this method can be useful for integrating with other libraries or for extending functionality.

* `eventName`: A string representing the name of the event to listen for.  Custom event names are typically defined by you and your application's logic.
* `callback`: A function that will be executed when the event is triggered.  The callback function will receive an event object (the nature of this object depends on how you define and trigger custom events within your application).


**Example:** (Illustrative, as Clipboard.js itself doesn't directly trigger `myCustomEvent`)

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');

clipboard.on('myCustomEvent', (event) => {
  console.log('Custom event triggered:', event);
});

// You would trigger 'myCustomEvent' from your application logic separately.
```


### `clipboard.off(eventName, callback)`

This method removes an event listener that was previously added using `clipboard.on()`. If you add multiple listeners for the same event, this will remove only the specific listener callback function provided.

* `eventName`: The name of the event for which to remove the listener.
* `callback`: The specific callback function to remove.  If omitted, *all* listeners for that event are removed.

**Example:**

```javascript
const myCustomCallback = (event) => { /* ... */ };
clipboard.on('myCustomEvent', myCustomCallback);
// ... later ...
clipboard.off('myCustomEvent', myCustomCallback); // Removes only myCustomCallback
clipboard.off('myCustomEvent'); // Removes all listeners for 'myCustomEvent'
```


### `clipboard.destroy()`

This method completely destroys the Clipboard.js instance, removing all event listeners and releasing any resources it holds. It's crucial to call this method when you no longer need the Clipboard.js functionality, especially in applications with component lifecycles (like React or Vue), to prevent memory leaks and potential conflicts.  Failing to destroy the instance can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Example:**

```javascript
const clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');
// ... later, when you no longer need the clipboard functionality ...
clipboard.destroy();
```

In frameworks like React, you would typically call `destroy()` within the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method to ensure cleanup when the component is removed from the DOM.  In Vue, you might place it within the `beforeDestroy` hook.  Always follow the best practices of your specific framework to effectively manage the lifecycle of external libraries.
