## Getting Started

### Installation

RoyalSlider can be installed via npm or yarn, or by downloading the files directly from the [RoyalSlider website](replace with actual website link).

**npm:**

```bash
npm install royalslider
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add royalslider
```

**Direct Download:** Download the necessary files (JS and CSS) from the RoyalSlider website and include them in your project.  Make sure to download the version that matches your project's requirements.


### Basic Usage

After installation, include the RoyalSlider JavaScript file and CSS file in your HTML document. Then, initialize RoyalSlider on a container element by selecting it using its ID or a CSS selector.  You'll need to provide an array of image sources or other content to populate the slider.  Basic options can be set to customize the slider's appearance and behavior. Refer to the [options documentation](replace with actual link) for a comprehensive list.

### First Example

This example demonstrates a simple RoyalSlider setup with three images:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>RoyalSlider Example</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="royalslider.css"> </head>
<body>

<div id="royalslider" style="width:600px; height:400px;">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<script src="royalslider.js"></script>
<script>
  jQuery(function($) {
    $('#royalslider').royalSlider({
      // options here, see full options list in the docs
    });
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Remember to replace `"image1.jpg"`, `"image2.jpg"`, and `"image3.jpg"` with the actual paths to your images.  You should also replace `"royalslider.css"` and `"royalslider.js"` with the correct paths to your downloaded files.


### Including CSS and JS

Include the RoyalSlider CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document's `<head>` section.  Ensure that the jQuery library is also included *before* the RoyalSlider JavaScript file, as RoyalSlider depends on jQuery.  The order is crucial:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/royalslider.css">
  <script src="path/to/jquery.js"></script>
  <script src="path/to/royalslider.js"></script>
</head>
```

Replace `"path/to/royalslider.css"`, `"path/to/jquery.js"`, and `"path/to/royalslider.js"` with the actual paths to your files.  Make sure the paths are correct relative to your HTML file's location.  If you're using a module bundler, the process might be slightly different, consult your bundler's documentation.


## Core Functionality

### Slider Initialization

RoyalSlider is initialized using jQuery.  You select the container element (usually a `<div>`) and call the `royalSlider()` method, passing an options object to customize its behavior.  The options object allows you to configure numerous aspects of the slider, from the transition type to the navigation controls.  A minimal initialization would look like this:


```javascript
jQuery(function($) {
  $('#mySlider').royalSlider({
    // options go here
  });
});
```

Replace `'#mySlider'` with the appropriate selector for your slider container.  See the [options documentation](replace with actual link) for a comprehensive list of available options.


### Navigation

RoyalSlider provides various navigation methods.  By default, it includes prev/next buttons. You can customize or add other navigation elements such as thumbnails, bullets, or a fullscreen button through options.  For example, to enable thumbnail navigation, you would include the `thumbnails` option in your initialization:

```javascript
$('#mySlider').royalSlider({
  thumbnails: {
    appendSpan: true, // or false
    arrows: true, // or false,
    // other thumbnail options...
  }
});
```

Consult the [navigation options documentation](replace with actual link) for detailed configuration.


### Autoplay

RoyalSlider supports autoplay functionality. You can enable it and configure the interval (delay between slides) using the `autoScale` and `autoPlay` options:

```javascript
$('#mySlider').royalSlider({
  autoPlay: {
    enabled: true,
    pauseOnHover: true, // pause when hovering
    interval: 3000 // milliseconds
  }
});

```

`pauseOnHover` will pause the autoplay when the user hovers over the slider, providing a more user-friendly experience.


### Responsive Design

RoyalSlider is designed to be responsive. It automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.  You can fine-tune its responsiveness using options to control how the slider adapts to various screen widths and aspect ratios. For example, you can set `autoScale` to `true` to enable automatic scaling. You can also manually specify breakpoints and their corresponding settings to achieve more precise control.  See the [responsive options documentation](replace with actual link) for details on controlling the slider's behavior at different screen sizes.


### Keyboard Navigation

RoyalSlider supports keyboard navigation by default. Users can typically navigate through slides using the left and right arrow keys.  This behavior can be further customized or disabled via options, allowing for full control over keyboard interactions.  Refer to the  [keyboard navigation options](replace with actual link) documentation for details.


### Touch Support

RoyalSlider has built-in support for touch devices. Users can swipe to navigate through slides on touch-enabled devices. This functionality is automatically enabled, and you usually don't need to configure it explicitly. However, you can adjust sensitivity and other parameters via options if needed.  See the [touch interaction options](replace with actual link) for advanced configurations.


## Advanced Features

### Custom Skins and Themes

RoyalSlider allows for extensive customization of its appearance. You can create custom skins and themes by modifying the provided CSS or creating entirely new stylesheets. This allows for seamless integration with your website's design.  The structure of the CSS and the available classes are documented in the [skinning documentation](replace with actual link). You can also use pre-built themes available online or create your own.


### Image Loading and Preloading

RoyalSlider offers control over image loading and preloading. You can optimize performance by preloading images to ensure smooth transitions.  Options exist to control the number of images preloaded, whether images are loaded eagerly or lazily, and more. Consult the [image loading options](replace with actual link) for details.


### Video Support

RoyalSlider supports embedding videos from various sources, such as YouTube or Vimeo, directly into your slider. You can specify video URLs within your slider data, and RoyalSlider will handle the embedding and playback.  Specific options for video integration are outlined in the [video support documentation](replace with actual link).


### Carousel Mode

RoyalSlider supports a carousel mode where slides are displayed horizontally in a continuous loop. This is configured using specific options in the slider initialization.  Refer to the [carousel mode options](replace with actual link) for detailed settings and configuration.


### Fullscreen Mode

RoyalSlider allows the slider to be displayed in fullscreen mode.  This can be enabled through options or triggered programmatically via API calls.  The [fullscreen mode documentation](replace with actual link) details how to enable and control this functionality.


### Infinite Loop

The infinite loop feature allows for seamless transitions between the last and first slides, creating a continuous loop effect. This can enhance the user experience, particularly when using autoplay.  Enable and configure this feature through options described in the [infinite loop options](replace with actual link) section.


### Callbacks and Events

RoyalSlider provides a rich set of callbacks and events that allow you to respond to various slider actions, such as slide changes, resizing, and user interactions. These callbacks and events enable custom behaviors and dynamic updates to your slider.  A full list and explanations of callbacks and events can be found in the [events and callbacks documentation](replace with actual link).


### Custom Transitions

While RoyalSlider offers several built-in transitions, you can also create your own custom transitions using CSS animations or JavaScript. This allows for highly unique and visually striking effects.  More information on creating and implementing custom transitions is available in the [custom transitions documentation](replace with actual link).


### Lazy Loading

To improve initial page load time, especially when dealing with many high-resolution images, RoyalSlider supports lazy loading.  Images are only loaded when they are about to become visible in the viewport. This significantly enhances performance. Configure lazy loading using options described in the [lazy loading options](replace with actual link) section.


## API Reference

### Methods

RoyalSlider exposes a number of methods via its API that allow for programmatic control over the slider.  These methods enable you to interact with and manipulate the slider dynamically after it has been initialized.  Here are some key methods (a complete list can be found in the [full API documentation](replace with actual link)):


* **`goTo(index, speed, callback)`:** Navigates to a specific slide by index. `speed` specifies the animation speed, and `callback` is an optional function to execute after the transition.

* **`prev()`:** Navigates to the previous slide.

* **`next()`:** Navigates to the next slide.

* **`stopAutoplay()`:** Stops the autoplay functionality.

* **`startAutoplay()`:** Starts the autoplay functionality.

* **`destroy()`:** Completely removes the slider from the DOM and releases resources.

* **`updateSlider()`:**  Updates the slider's dimensions and layout. Useful after dynamic content changes.


Each method has specific parameters and return values documented in the full API reference.  Remember to call these methods using the jQuery object representing your RoyalSlider instance (e.g., `$('#mySlider').data('royalSlider').goTo(2);`).


### Properties

RoyalSlider also exposes various properties that allow you to access its current state and configuration. You can retrieve these properties using the same jQuery approach as with the methods.  Here are a few important properties:


* **`currentState.index`:** The index of the currently active slide (zero-based).

* **`settings.autoPlay.enabled`:** A boolean indicating whether autoplay is enabled.

* **`settings.loop`:** A boolean indicating whether the infinite loop is enabled.

* **`slides`:** An array containing information about all slides.


Access these properties using `$('#mySlider').data('royalSlider').currentState.index` and similar patterns.  Refer to the [full API properties reference](replace with actual link) for a complete list.


### Events

RoyalSlider triggers a variety of events during its lifecycle.  These events allow you to hook into various actions and implement custom behaviors based on the slider's state.  You can listen for these events using jQuery's `.on()` method.  Some important events include:


* **`royalSlider.beforeSlideChange`:** Triggered before a slide transition begins.

* **`royalSlider.afterSlideChange`:** Triggered after a slide transition completes.

* **`royalSlider.keyboard`:** Triggered when a keyboard navigation event occurs.

* **`royalSlider.resize`:** Triggered when the slider is resized.

* **`royalSlider.autoplay`:** Triggered when the autoplay starts or stops.


An example of listening for an event:

```javascript
$('#mySlider').on('royalSlider.afterSlideChange', function(event, data) {
  console.log('Slide changed to index: ' + data.index);
});
```

The [complete event reference](replace with actual link) provides detailed descriptions of all events, including the data objects they pass. Remember to consult that documentation for precise parameter details and handling.


## Customization

### Options and Settings

RoyalSlider offers a wide range of options and settings to customize its behavior and appearance.  These options are passed as a JavaScript object to the `royalSlider()` initialization method.  They control various aspects, from the transition type and navigation style to autoplay behavior and responsiveness.  A comprehensive list of all available options is available in the [options reference](replace with actual link).  Modifying these options allows you to tailor the slider to your specific needs without modifying core code.  For example, to change the transition type:

```javascript
$('#mySlider').royalSlider({
  transitionType: 'fade', // or 'crossfade', 'rotate', etc.
  // other options...
});
```


### Modifying Styles

You can customize the slider's visual appearance by modifying its styles using CSS.  RoyalSlider provides a well-structured CSS framework that allows you to target specific elements and modify their colors, fonts, sizes, and other properties. You can create a custom stylesheet and link it to your HTML file, overriding or extending the default styles.  Inspecting the default CSS file (usually found in the downloaded package) is helpful in understanding the class names and structure.  Directly modifying the default CSS is generally discouraged; creating a separate stylesheet for custom rules is the preferred approach.



### Extending Functionality

RoyalSlider's architecture allows for extending its core functionality without directly modifying its source code. This is done by creating custom JavaScript functions that interact with the slider's API, adding new features or modifying existing behavior.  For instance, you could write a function that adds a new navigation button or modifies the way slides are loaded. Access to the slider instance via `$('#mySlider').data('royalSlider')` lets you call its API methods and manipulate the internal data.  This approach promotes maintainability and easier upgrades to newer versions of RoyalSlider.



### Creating Custom Plugins

For more complex extensions, creating custom plugins is recommended.  Plugins encapsulate new functionality in a reusable and modular way.  A plugin typically consists of a JavaScript file that registers itself with RoyalSlider, adding new methods, options, or events.  This keeps your custom code organized and separate from the core slider library. The process of developing a plugin involves creating a JavaScript file that registers a new plugin with RoyalSlider and implements the desired functionality, often using the provided API and event system.  Specific steps and examples for plugin development might be found in the [plugin development guide](replace with actual link), if available.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

This section addresses frequently encountered problems when using RoyalSlider.

* **Slider not showing:** Double-check that you have correctly included the necessary CSS and JavaScript files (including jQuery) in your HTML, and that the paths are accurate.  Verify that the selector used to initialize the slider (`#mySlider` or similar) correctly targets the container element in your HTML. Inspect the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors.

* **Images not displaying:** Ensure that the image paths specified in your slider data are correct and accessible.  Check your server configuration if images are hosted remotely. Consider using the browser's developer tools to check for 404 errors or other network issues related to image loading.

* **Incorrect slider dimensions:** Make sure that you have set appropriate width and height values for the slider container element. If using responsive design, check your responsive options to ensure the slider adapts correctly to different screen sizes.

* **Navigation issues:** Verify that the navigation options are correctly configured. Inspect the generated HTML to ensure that navigation elements are present and correctly styled.

* **Autoplay not working:** Check if autoplay is enabled in the options, and make sure there are no conflicting JavaScript scripts or CSS rules affecting the slider.


### Debugging Tips

Effective debugging is crucial for resolving RoyalSlider issues.  Here are some helpful tips:

* **Browser developer tools:** Utilize your browser's built-in developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to inspect the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of your page. This helps identify errors, check network requests (image loading), and examine the slider's internal state.  Look for JavaScript errors in the console.

* **Console logging:** Insert `console.log()` statements in your code to track the values of variables, check the execution flow, and identify potential problems in your custom JavaScript.  Log the slider object (`console.log($('#mySlider').data('royalSlider'))`) to inspect its properties and methods.

* **Simplify your setup:** Create a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the issue.  Start with a basic slider configuration and gradually add features to pinpoint the source of the problem.

* **Check the RoyalSlider documentation:** The official documentation thoroughly explains configuration options, API methods, and common issues.  Search for your specific problem or explore the troubleshooting section.

* **Search for similar issues:** Online forums and communities might contain solutions to similar problems you're facing.


### Error Handling

RoyalSlider provides some mechanisms for error handling, though specific error messages might be limited.  The primary method is to carefully check the browser's developer console for JavaScript errors.  These errors often point to problems with your slider configuration, data, or custom code.

For handling potential issues during runtime (e.g., failed image loading), you can use callbacks and events such as `royalSlider.error` (if available; check the documentation for your RoyalSlider version) or implement your own error checks within your custom code.


### Browser Compatibility

RoyalSlider aims for broad browser compatibility, but some features might depend on specific browser capabilities.  Generally, modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) offer the best support. Older or less common browsers may have limited compatibility with certain advanced features or CSS effects.  Always test your implementation across your target browsers to ensure consistent functionality and visual appearance.  Check the official RoyalSlider documentation for specifics on supported browser versions.


## Examples

These examples demonstrate various uses of RoyalSlider.  Remember to replace placeholder image and video URLs with your actual content.  Also, ensure that you've included the necessary jQuery and RoyalSlider files (CSS and JS) in your HTML as described in the installation section.

### Basic Slider Example

This example shows a simple slider with three images and basic navigation:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>RoyalSlider Basic Example</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="royalslider.css">
</head>
<body>

<div id="basicSlider" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="royalslider.js"></script>
<script>
jQuery(function($) {
  $('#basicSlider').royalSlider({
    // Add options as needed, e.g., transitionType: 'fade'
  });
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```


### Carousel Example

This example demonstrates a carousel-style slider with continuous looping:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>RoyalSlider Carousel Example</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="royalslider.css">
</head>
<body>

<div id="carouselSlider" style="width: 600px; height: 200px;">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="royalslider.js"></script>
<script>
jQuery(function($) {
  $('#carouselSlider').royalSlider({
    loop: true,
    autoScaleSlider: true,
    numVisible: 3, // Adjust as needed
    // Add other options as needed
  });
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```


### Video Slider Example

This example shows a slider containing both images and embedded YouTube videos:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>RoyalSlider Video Example</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="royalslider.css">
</head>
<body>

<div id="videoSlider" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>

<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="royalslider.js"></script>
<script>
jQuery(function($) {
  $('#videoSlider').royalSlider({
    // Add options as needed.  You might need additional configuration for video handling.
  });
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```
Remember to replace `"YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID"` with an actual YouTube video ID.


### Custom Skin Example

This example requires creating a separate CSS file (`custom-skin.css`) to style the slider. The content of `custom-skin.css` would contain custom CSS rules to override or extend the default RoyalSlider styles.  The HTML structure remains largely the same as the basic example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>RoyalSlider Custom Skin Example</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="royalslider.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom-skin.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Slider HTML same as basic example -->
</body>
</html>
```

The `custom-skin.css` file would then contain your custom styles targeting RoyalSlider's classes.  Remember to inspect the default CSS to understand the class names you need to target for customization.  This example is illustrative; the actual `custom-skin.css` content would depend on your desired design.
